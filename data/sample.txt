"Few natural basic principles allow to extend Feynman integral over the paths to an integral over the surfaces so, that they coincide at long time scale, that is when the surface degenerates into a single particle world line. In the first approximation the loop Green functions have perimeter behavior. That corresponds to the case when free quarks interact through one gluon exchange. Quantum fluctuations of the surface generate the area low. Thus in this string theory asymptotic freedom and confinement can coexist. "
"We study the effects of adding loops to a critical percolation cluster on the diffusional, and equivalently, (scalar) elastic properties of the fractal network. From the numerical calculations of the eigenspectrum of the transition probability matrix, we find that the spectral dimension $d_s$ and the walk dimension $d_w$ change suddenly as soon as the floppy ends of a critical percolation cluster are connected together to form relatively large loops, and that the additional inclusion of successively smaller loops only change these exponents little if at all. This suggests that there is a new universality class associated with the loop-enhanced percolation problem. "
"We propose that large quantum fluctuations of the conformal factor drastically modify classical general relativity at cosmological distance scales, resulting in a scale invariant phase of quantum gravity in the far infrared. We derive scaling relations for the partition function and physical observables in this conformal phase, and suggest quantitative tests of these relations in numerical simulations of simplicial four geometries with $S^4$ topology. In particular, we predict the form of the critical curve in the coupling constant plane, and determine the scaling of the Newtonian coupling with volume which permits a sensible continuum limit. The existing numerical results already provide some evidence of this new conformal invariant phase of quantum gravity. "
"The off-shell behaviors of bound nucleons in deep inelastic lepton nucleus scattering are discussed in two scenarios with the basic constituents chosen to be baryon-mesons and quark-gluons respectively in light-cone formalism. It is found that when taking into account the effect due to internal quark structure of nucleons, the derived scaling variable for bound nucleons and the calculated nuclear structure functions are different from those in considering the baryon-mesons as the effective elementary constituents. This implies that the pure baryon-meson descriptions of nuclei give the inaccurate off-shell behavior of the bound nucleon structure function, thereby the quark-gluons seem to be the most appropriate degrees of freedom for nuclear descriptions. It is also shown that the EMC effect cannot be explained by nuclear binding effect from a sound theoretical basis. "
"Following some recent work by Gross, we consider the partition function for QCD on a two dimensional torus and study its stringiness. We present strong evidence that the free energy corresponds to a sum over branched surfaces with small handles mapped into the target space. The sum is modded out by all diffeomorphisms on the world-sheet. This leaves a sum over disconnected classes of maps. We prove that the free energy gives a consistent result for all smooth maps of the torus into the torus which cover the target space $p$ times, where $p$ is prime, and conjecture that this is true for all coverings. Each class can also contain integrations over the positions of branch points and small handles which act as ``moduli'' on the surface. We show that the free energy is consistent for any number of handles and that the first few leading terms are consistent with contributions from maps with branch points. "
"The future of mathematics is described, by using the WZ algorithmic proof theory as a parable. "
"I describe the string solutions in the standard electroweak model and argue that they may be stabilized by quark, lepton or other bound states. I then reinterpret the sphaleron in terms of electroweak strings and show that it can be viewed as a loop of W-string or a segment of Z-string. (Talk presented at Texas/Pascos 1992 at Berkeley.) "
"The validity of using QCD perturbation theory to generate dynamically the parton distribution functions of hadrons, starting from a valencelike input at low $Q^2$, is discussed. In particular, we consider the prescription of Barone {\em et al} who evolve from $Q^2 = 0$, and that of Gl\""uck {\em et al} who start evolution from $Q^2 \simeq (2\Lambda_{QCD})^2$. "
"Vertex operator algebras are mathematically rigorous objects corresponding to chiral algebras in conformal field theory. Operads are mathematical devices to describe operations, that is, $n$-ary operations for all $n$ greater than or equal to $0$, not just binary products. In this paper, a reformulation of the notion of vertex operator algebra in terms of operads is presented. This reformulation shows that the rich geometric structure revealed in the study of conformal field theory and the rich algebraic structure of the theory of vertex operator algebras share a precise common foundation in basic operations associated with a certain kind of (two-dimensional) ``complex'' geometric object, in the sense in which classical algebraic structures (groups, algebras, Lie algebras and the like) are always implicitly based on (one-dimensional) ``real'' geometric objects. In effect, the standard analogy between point-particle theory and string theory is being shown to manifest itself at a more fundamental mathematical level. "
"We apply the fusion procedure to a quantum Yang-Baxter algebra associated with time-discrete integrable systems, notably integrable quantum mappings. We present a general construction of higher-order quantum invariants for these systems. As an important class of examples, we present the Yang-Baxter structure of the Gel'fand-Dikii mapping hierarchy, that we have introduced in previous papers, together with the corresponding explicit commuting family of quantum invariants. "
"We study duality transformations for two-dimensional sigma models with abelian chiral isometries and prove that generic such transformations are equivalent to integrated marginal perturbations by bilinears in the chiral currents, thus confirming a recent conjecture by Hassan and Sen formulated in the context of Wess-Zumino-Witten models. Specific duality transformations instead give rise to coset models plus free bosons. "
"We calculate the momentum dependence of the $\rho-\omega$ mixing amplitude in a purely hadronic model. The basic assumption of the model is that the mixing amplitude is generated by $N{\bar{N}}$ loops and thus driven entirely by the neutron-proton mass difference. The value of the amplitude at the $\omega$-meson point is expressed in terms of only the $NN\omega$ and the $NN\rho$ coupling constants. Using values for these couplings constrained by empirical two-nucleon data we obtain a value for the mixing amplitude in agreement with experiment. Extending these results to the spacelike region, we find a $\rho-\omega$ contribution to the NN interaction that is strongly suppressed and opposite in sign relative to the conventional contribution obtained from using the constant on-shell value for the mixing amplitude. "
"A relation between the number of rational curves of fixed degree on Calabi Yau threefolds and the Picard Fuchs equations, which was suggested as part of the study of mirror symmetry, is verified in the case of complete intersection of two cubics and lines. "
"It is shown that the previously known $N=3$ and $N=4$ superconformal algebras can be contracted consistently by singular scaling of some of the generators. For the later case, by a contraction which depends on the central term, we obtain a new $N=4$ superconformal algebra which contains an $SU(2)\times {U(1)}^4$ Kac-Moody subalgebra and has nonzero central extension. "
"We discuss the large order behaviour and Borel summability of the topological expansion of models of 2D gravity coupled to general $(p,q)$ conformal matter. In a previous work it was proven that at large order $k$ the string susceptibility had a generic $a^k\Gamma(2k-\ud)$ behaviour. Moreover the constant $a$, relevant for the problem of Borel summability, was determined for all one-matrix models. We here obtain a set of equations for this constant in the general $(p,q)$ model. String equations can be derived from the construction of two differential operators $P,Q$ satisfying canonical commutation relations $[P,Q]=1$. We show that the equation for $a$ is determined by the form of the operators $P,Q$ in the spherical or semiclassical limits. The results for the general one-matrix models are then easily recovered. Moreover, since for the $(p,q)$ string models such $p=(2m+1)q\pm1$ the semiclassical forms of $P,Q$ are explicitly known, the large order behaviour is completely determined. This class contains all unitary $(q+1,q)$ models for which the answer is specially simple. As expected we find that the topological expansion for unitary models is not Borel summable. \preprint{SPhT/92-163}, Plain-TeX, macro harvmac "
"I provide an extremely simple argument that the kink-type solitons in certain theories are fermionic. The argument is based on the Witten index, but can in fact be used to determine soliton statistics in non-supersymmetric theories as well. "
"We propose to measure the Wess-Zumino anomaly contribution by considering angular distributions in the decays $\tau\to\nu_\tau \eta\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$, $\tau\to\nu_\tau K^- \pi^{-} K^+ $ and $\tau\to\nu_\tau K^- \pi^- \pi^+$. Radial excitations of the $K^*$, which cannot be seen in $e^++e^-$, should be observed in the $ K^- \pi^+ \pi^-$ decay channel. "
"Toponium production at future hadron colliders is investigated. Perturbative QCD corrections to the production cross section for gluon fusion are calculated as well as the contributions from gluon-quark and quark-antiquark collisions to the total cross section. The dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales and on the choice of the parton distribution functions is explored. QCD corrections to the branching ratio of $\eta_{t}$ into $\gamma\gamma$ are included and the two-loop QCD potential is used to predict the wave function at the origin. The branching ratio of $\eta_{t}$ into $\gamma Z$, $ZZ$, $HZ$ and $WW$ is compared with the $\gamma\gamma$ channel. "

"We give model-independent arguments, valid in nearly any number of spacetime dimensions, that topological solitons and instantons satisfy Bogomol'nyi-type bounds and, when these bounds are saturated, satisfy self-duality equations. In the supersymmetric case, we also show that, in spacetime dimensions greater than two, theories with topological charges necessarily exhibit extended supersymmetry, in which the topological charge appears as the central charge. The significance of our arguments lies in their generality. In the supersymmetric case, we obtain insight into the contrast observed between topological charges in 1+1 and higher dimensional models. The centerpiece of our method is to require that the supersymmetric extension of a generic (non-supersymmetric) field theory be self-consistent. Our discussion of supersymmetric extensions is quite detailed, and introduces the notion of the ""associated superfield"" to construct such extensions. "
"A representation for the fermionic determinant of the massive Schwinger model, or $QED_2$, is obtained that makes a clean separation between the Schwinger model and its massive counterpart. From this it is shown that the index theorem for $QED_2$ follows from gauge invariance, that the Schwinger model's contribution to the determinant is canceled in the weak field limit, and that the determinant vanishes when the field strength is sufficiently strong to form a zero-energy bound state. "
"We consider the neutron matter quark matter phase transition along with possible existence of hybrid quark stars. The equation of state for neutron matter is obtained using a nonperturbative method with pion dressing of the neutron matter and an analysis similar to that of symmetric nuclear matter. The quark matter sector is treated perturbatively in the small distance domain. For bag constant $B^{1/4}$=148 MeV, a first order phase transition is seen. In the context of neutron quark hybrid stars, Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations are solved using the equations of state for quark matter and for neutron matter with a phase transition as noted earlier. Stable solutions for such stars are obtained with the Chandrasekhar limit as 1.58 $M_\odot$ and radius around 10 km. The bulk of the star is quark matter with a thin crust of neutron matter of less than a kilometer. "
"We review the recently proposed \lc\ quantization of the matrix model which is expected to have a critical point describing 2-d quantum gravity coupled to $c=2$ matter. In the $N\to\infty$ limit, we derive a linear Schroedinger equation for the free string spectrum. Numerical study of this equation suggests that the spectrum is tachyonic, and that the string tension diverges at the critical point. "
"We present a classification of characteristic Dynkin diagrams for the $A_N$, $B_N$, $C_N$ and $D_N$ algebras. This classification is related to the classification of \cw(\cg,\ck) algebras arising from non-Abelian Toda models, and we argue that it can give new insight on the structure of $W$ algebras. "
"To leading order in displacement size, the scattering of electrons in a Cu-O plane from O displacements perpendicular to that plane is due to spin-orbit coupling. This scattering is investigated with the following results: (1) As a consequence of time-reversal symmetry, spin fluctuations, which can strongly enhance scattering from a spin impurity, do not enhance spin-orbit scattering; and (2) for a superconductor with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$ gap function, pair-breaking from spin-orbit scattering can be strong, particularly in a structurally disordered phase in which locally CuO$_6$ octahedra tilt as in the orthorhombic phase of La$_2$CuO$_4$, but globally the average structure is tetragonal. These results are discussed in the context of the (La,Nd)-(Sr,Ba)-Cu-O system where certain structural transitions are observed to suppress superconductivity. "
"After a brief mention of Bose and Fermi oscillators and of particles which obey other types of statistics, including intermediate statistics, parastatistics, paronic statistics, anyon statistics and infinite statistics, I discuss the statistics of ``quons'' (pronounced to rhyme with muons), particles whose annihilation and creation operators obey the $q$-deformed commutation relation (the quon algebra or q-mutator) which interpolates between fermions and bosons. I emphasize that the operator for interaction with an external source must be an effective Bose operator in all cases. To accomplish this for parabose, parafermi and quon operators, I introduce parabose, parafermi and quon Grassmann numbers, respectively. I also discuss interactions of non-relativistic quons, quantization of quon fields with antiparticles, calculation of vacuum matrix elements of relativistic quon fields, demonstration of the TCP theorem, cluster decomposition, and Wick's theorem for relativistic quon fields, and the failure of local commutativity of observables for relativistic quon fields. I conclude with the bound on the parameter $q$ for electrons due to the Ramberg-Snow experiment. "
"A 130 GeV mass is calculated for the t-quark, also called the truth quark or the top quark. The 130 GeV T-quark mass is consistent with the analysis of Dalitz and Goldstein (131 GeV (-11, +22 )) of a CDF T-quark candidate event [1]. It is not consistent with the theoretical calculations of Dimopoulos, Hall, and Raby that the T-quark mass range should be 176 to 190 GeV [2]. The calculation uses a model in which the 28-dimensional adjoint representation of Spin(8) forms the gauge group of the model with an 8-dimensional spacetime whose tangent vector space is represented by the vector representation of Spin(8); the first generation fermion particles and antiparticles are represented by the two mirror image 8-dimensional half-spinor representations of Spin(8). The 8-dimensional spacetime of the model is reduced to 4 dimensions. Dimensional reduction gives the fermions a 3-generation structure. At request, I added a chronology including work of others. "
"Recent reports of the observation of the decay $\tau \rarrow \nu_{\tau} + K + \pi + \pi$ raise interesting questions. The $u-s$ quark mass difference can induce an effective second-class current in the strange sector and enhance decays to helicity-suppressed scalar states. This suggests searches for scalar strange mesons in the $\tau \rarrow \nu_{\tau} + K + \eta' $ and $\tau \rarrow \nu_{\tau} + K + \pi$ decay modes. $\tau$ decays to axial vector final states may clarify strange meson spectroscopy by analogy with the clarification of the $a_1$ problem in the nonstrange sector. Open questions include mixing effects in the strange axial vector mesons and the implications of models based on QCD for hadronization and final state interactions following the creation of a $q \bar q$ pair by a weak vertex, "
"I review the discovery of the color degree of freedom in hadronic physics, and the developments which led from that discovery to the local gauge theory of color, quantum chromodynamics. "
"We propose a model for Quantum Chromodynamics, obtained by ignoring the angular dependence of the gluon fields, which could qualitatively describe systems containing one heavy quark. This leads to a two dimensional gauge theory which has chiral symmetry and heavy quark symmetry. We show that in a light cone formalism, the Hamiltonian of this spherical QCD can be expressed entirely in terms of color singlet variables. Furthermore, in the large $N_c$ limit, it tends to a classical hadron theory. We derive an integral equation for the masses and wavefunctions of a heavy meson. This can be interpreted as a relativistic potential model. The integral equation is scale invariant, but renormalization of the coupling constant generates a scale. We compute the approximate beta function of the coupling constant, which has an ultraviolet stable fixed point at the origin. "
"We show that some models with non-local (and non-localizable) interactions have a property, called quasi-locality, which allows for the definition of a transfer matrix. We give the Yang-Baxter equation as a sufficient condition for the existence of a family of commuting transfer matrices and solve them for a loop model with intersections. This solvable model is then analyzed in some detail and its applications to a Lorentz gas are briefly discussed. "
"We analyze carefully the problem of gauge symmetries for Bianchi models, from both the geometrical and dynamical points of view. Some of the geometrical definitions of gauge symmetries (=``homogeneity preserving diffeomorphisms'') given in the literature do not incorporate the crucial feature that local gauge transformations should be independent at each point of the manifold of the independent variables ( = time for Bianchi models), i.e, should be arbitrarily localizable ( in time). We give a geometrical definition of homogeneity preserving diffeomorphisms that does not possess this shortcoming. The proposed definition has the futher advantage of coinciding with the dynamical definition based on the invariance of the action ( in Lagrangian or Hamiltonian form). We explicitly verify the equivalence of the Lagrangian covariant phase space with the Hamiltonian reduced phase space. Remarks on the use of the Ashtekar variables in Bianchi models are also given. "
"The $\eta_6$, a ``heavy axion'' associated with sextet quark electroweak symmetry breaking, may have been seen at LEP via its two-photon decay mode and also at TRISTAN via its hadronic decay modes. - presented at DPF 92. "
"We show that on the Jacobian $(JC,\theta)$ of a smooth curve $C$ of genus $g$, any effective cycle in $JC$ with cohomology class $\theta^d/d!$ is a translate of $W_{g-d}(C)$ or $-W_{g-d}(C)$. We then use this result to prove that for $1<d<g$, the Jacobian locus (\resp the locus of intermediate Jacobians of cubic threefolds) is an irreducible component of the set of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $g$ for which $\theta^d/d!$ (\resp $\theta^3/3!$) is the class of an effective algebraic cycle. Moreover, on the intermediate Jacobian of a generic cubic threefold, $\theta^2/2!$ is not the class of an effective algebraic cycle. "
"Let $C$ be a smooth plane curve of degree $d$ defined over an algebraically closed field $k$. A base point free complete very special linear system $g^r_n$ on $C$ is trivial if there exists an integer $m\ge 0$ and an effective divisor $E$ on $C$ of degree $md-n$ such that $g^r_n=|mg^2_d-E|$ and $r=(m^2+3m)/2-(md-n)$. In this paper, we prove the following: Theorem Let $g^r_n$ be a base point free very special non-trivial complete linear system on $C$. Write $r=(x+1)(x+2)/2-b$ with $x, b$ integers satisfying $x\ge 1, 0\le b \le x$. Then $n\ge n(r):=(d-3)(x+3)-b$. Moreover, this inequality is best possible. "
"Majoron models provide neutrino masses via the spontaneous breaking of a global $U(1)$ symmetry. However, it may be argued that all global symmetries will be explicitly violated by gravitational effects. We show that it is possible to preserve most of the usual features of majoron models by invoking $U(1)_{B-L}$ to be a gauge symmetry and adding a second singlet scalar field. The majoron gets a small model dependent mass. The couplings of majorons to neutrinos may be of ordinary strength or may be made arbitrarily weak. We discuss the cosmological and astrophysical consequences of majoron models in the context of a model dependent majoron mass and neutrino coupling. For an appropriate choice of parameters majorons can play the role of dark matter. "
"Pion elastic, charge exchange scattering and induced eta production on the trinucleon systems are investigated in a coupled-channels approach in momentum space with Fadeev wave functions. The channel $\pi N \rightarrow \eta N$ is included using an isobar model with S-, P-, and D-wave resonances. While the coherent reactions like $^3$He($\pi,\pi)^3$He can be reasonably well reproduced up to $T_{\pi}$=500 MeV, large discrepancies appear for the incoherent processes, $^3$He($\pi^-,\pi^0)^3$H and $^3$He($\pi^-,\eta)^3$H at backward angles and energies above $\Delta$-resonance. In the forward direction the $(\pi,\eta)$ calculations underestimate the experimental measurements very close to threshold but agreement with the data improves with increasing pion energy. Predictions are made for the asymmetries of the various reactions on polarized $^3$He. "
We perform a quantitative analysis of $D\bar{D}$ mixing in Heavy Quark Effective Field Theory (HqEFT) including leading order QCD corrections. We find an enhancement of the short-distance contribution by a factor of two or three. 
"We investigate the sensitivity of individual LIGO/VIRGO-like interferometers and the precision with which they can determine the characteristics of an inspiralling binary system. Since the two interferometers of the LIGO detector share nearly the same orientation, their joint sensitivity is similar to that of a single, more sensitive interferometer. We express our results for a single interferometer of both initial and advanced LIGO design, and also for the LIGO detector in the limit that its two interferometers share exactly the same orientation. We approximate the evolution of a binary system as driven exclusively by leading order quadrupole gravitational radiation. To assess the sensitivity, we calculate the rate at which sources are expected to be observed, the range to which they are observable, and the precision with which characteristic quantities describing the observed binary system can be determined. Assuming a conservative rate density for coalescing neutron star binary systems we expect that the advanced LIGO detector will observe approximately 69~yr${}^{-1}$ with an amplitude SNR greater than 8. Of these, approximately 7~yr${}^{-1}$ will be from binaries at distances greater than 950~Mpc. We explore the sensitivity of these results to a tunable parameter in the interferometer design (the recycling frequency). The optimum choice of the parameter is dependent on the goal of the observations, e.g., maximizing the rate of detections or maximizing the precision of measurement. We determine the optimum parameter values for these two cases. "
"Transitions in a system of neutrinos with vacuum mixing and magnetic moments, propagating in matter and transverse magnetic field, are considered. It is shown that in the realistic case of magnetic field direction varying along the neutrino path qualitatively new phenomena become possible: permutation of neutrino conversion resonances, appearance of resonances in the neutrino-antineutrino ($\nu_{lL}\leftrightarrow\bar{\nu}_{lR}$) transition channels, neutrino-antineutrino resonant conversion, large amplitude $\nu_{lL}\leftrightarrow\bar{\nu}_{lR}$ oscillations, merging of different resonances (triple resonances). Possible phenomenological implications of these effects are briefly discussed. "
We present the solution of the discrete super-Virasoro constraints to all orders of the genus expansion. Integrating over the fermionic variables we get a representation of the partition function in terms of the one-matrix model. We also obtain the nonperturbative solution of the super-Virasoro constraints in the double scaling limit but do not find agreement between our flows and the known supersymmetric extensions of KdV. 
"Using shift vector method we obtain a large class of self-dual lattices of dimension $(l,l)$, which has a one to one correspondence with modular invariants of free bosonic theory compactified on co-root lattice of a rank $l$ Lie group. Then a large number of modular invariants of affine Lie algebras are derived explicitly. As two applications of this method, we give a direct derivation of $D$-series of $SU(N)$ and a new proof for the A-D-E classification of the $SU(2)_k$ partition functions. "
"Spherical configurations that are very massive must be surrounded by apparent horizons. These in turn, when placed outside a collapsing body, must propagate outward with a velocity equal to the velocity of radially outgoing photons. That proves, within the framework of (1+3) formalism and without resorting to the Birkhoff theorem, that apparent horizons coincide with event horizons. "
"Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find the formation of heaps in a system of granular particles contained in a box with oscillating bottom and fixed sidewalls. The simulation includes the effect of static friction, which is found to be crucial in maintaining a stable heap. We also find another mechanism for heap formation in systems under constant vertical shear. In both systems, heaps are formed due to a net downward shear by the sidewalls. We discuss the origin of net downward shear for the vibration induced heap. "
"We suggest how to derive the exact (all order in $\a'$) expressions for the background fields for string solutions corresponding to gauged WZW models directly at the $2d$ field theory level. One is first to replace the classical gauged WZW action by the quantum effective one and then to integrate out the gauge field. We find the explicit expression for the gauge invariant non-local effective action of the gauged WZW model. The two terms (corresponding to the group and subgroup) which appear with the same coefficients in the classical action get different $k$-dependent coefficients in the effective one. The procedure of integrating out the gauge field is considered in detail for the $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ model and the exact expressions for the $D=2$ metric and the dilaton (originally found in the conformal field theory approach) are reproduced. "
"Using a multistate smearing method, Coulomb gauge wave functions of heavy-light mesons are studied in lattice QCD. Wave functions for the ground state, the first radially excited S-wave state, and the lowest P-wave states of a heavy-light meson are calculated in quenched approximation. The results are found to be in remarkably good agreement with the predictions of a simple relativistic quark model. "
"I describe possible ways to discover hard double pomeron exchange (HDPE) with the existing detectors at the Fermilab Tevatron, by using the small-angle ``luminosity'' counters as a veto. Estimates of the cross sections and backgrounds are made. In addition to the intrinsic importance of HDPE, its observation would be useful for calibrating the detectors, and for estimating the ``survival probability'' of rapidity gaps. "
"We examine the relationship between the decoherence of quantum-mechanical histories of a closed system (as discussed by Gell-Mann and Hartle) and environmentally-induced diagonalization of the density operator for an open system. We study a definition of decoherence which incorporates both of these ideas, and show that it leads to a consistent probabilistic interpretation of the reduced density operator. "
"Perturbative analysis of parton kinetics for high energy nuclear collisions shows, that thermal equilibration of gluons happens very fast, while quark production is much slower. A simple 'minimal model' is proposed which includes only in-coming quarks and anti-quarks. We have found that a smaller quark number is more than compensated by the fact, that they are imbedded into the hotter glue. Predicted yield of dileptons and photons in the interesting kinematic region are larger than considered before, and are quite observable at RHIC and LHC. "
"Free energy as a function of temperature and the bubble radius is determined for spherical bubbles created in cosmological first order phase transitions. The phase transition is assumed to be driven by an order parameter (e.g. a Higgs field) with quartic potential. The definition of the bubble radius and the corresponding generalized, curvature-dependent surface tensions are discussed. In the free energy expansion in powers of the inverse radius, the coefficients of the curvature term and the constant term are also calculated. "
"The recent COBE measurement of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and the recent South Pole experiment of Gaier {\it et al.} offer an excellent opportunity to probe cosmological theories. We test a class of theories in which the Universe today is flat and matter dominated, and primordial perturbations are adiabatic parameterized by an index $n$. In this class of theories the predicted signal in the South Pole experiment depends not only on $n$, but also on the Hubble constant and the baryon density. For $n=1$ a large region of this parameter space is ruled out, but there is still a window open which satisfies constraints coming from COBE, measurements of the age of the Universe, the South Pole experiment, and big bang nucleosynthesis. Using the central values of the Hubble constant and baryon density favored by nucleosynthesis and age measurements, we find that, even if the COBE normalization drops by $1\sigma$, $n > 1.2$ is ruled out. "
"We calculate the level statistics by finding the eigenvalue spectrum for a variety of one-dimensional many-body models, namely the Heisenberg chain, the t-J model and the Hubbard model. In each case the generic behaviour is GOE, however at points corresponding to models known to be exactly integrable Poisson statistics are found, in agreement with an argument we outline. "
"The distortion on the intermittency signal, due to detection efficiency and to the presence of pre--equilibrium emitted particles, is studied in a schematic model of nuclear multi- fragmentation. The source of the intermittency signal is modeled with a percolating system. The efficiency is schematized by a simple function of the fragment size, and the presence of pre--equilibrium particles is simulated by an additional non--critical fragment source. No selection on the events is considered, and therefore all events are used to calculate the moments. It is found that, despite the absence of event selection, the intermittency signal is quite resistant to the distortion due to the apparatus efficiency, while the inclusion of pre--equilibrium particles in the moment calculation can substantially reduce the strength of the signal. Pre--equilibrium particles should be therefore carefully separated from the rest of the detected fragments, before the intermittency analysis on experimental charge or mass distributions is carried out. "
"In view of the recent interest in the decays of mesons into a pair of light leptons, a computation of the QED radiative corrections to the decay of $\pi^{0}$ into an electron-positron pair is presented here. The results indicate that the peak value of the differential decay rate is reduced by about $50 \%$, because of soft-photon radiation. The number of $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs having invariant masses in an energy bin of 0.5 MeV centered around $m_{\pi}$ is found to be about $20 \%$ smaller than the one it would be if radiative corrections were neglected. "
"We report the results of first-principles electronic-structure calculations for superconducting Ba6C60. Unlike the A3C60 superconductors, this new compound shows strong Ba-C hybridization in the valence and conduction regions, mixed covalent/ionic bonding character, partial charge transfer, and insulating zero-gap band structure. "
We propose a new $q$-series formula for a character of parafermion conformal field theories associated to arbitrary non-twisted affine Lie algebra $\widehat{g}$. We show its natural origin from a thermodynamic Bethe ansatz analysis including chemical potentials. 
"For the two dimensional dilaton-coupled quantum gravity model, we give the local black hole mass, which is an analogue of what was first introduced by Fischler, Morgan and Polchinski in the four dimensional gravitational systems. We analyze the original CGHS model with this local mass and find that the local mass is decreasing in the future direction on the matter shock-wave line, while it stays constant at past null infinity. "
"We show that the leading $SU(3)$-breaking corrections to the $\Delta S = 1$ $f_1$ vector form factors of hyperons are $O(m_s)$ and $O(m_s^{3/2})$, and are expected to be $\sim 20$--$30\%$ by dimensional analysis. This is consistent with the Ademollo--Gatto theorem, in a sense that we explain. We compute the $O(m_s)$ corrections and a subset of the $O(m_s^{3/2})$ corrections using an effective lagrangian in which the baryons are treated as heavy particles. All of these corrections are surprisingly small, $\sim 5\%$; combining them, we obtain $\sim 5$--$10\%$ corrections. The pattern of corrections is very different than that predicted by quark models. "
"Extending the work of Park and Strominger, we prove a positive energy theorem for the exactly solvable quantum-corrected 2D dilaton gravity theories. The positive energy functional we construct is shown to be unique (within a reasonably broad class of such functionals). For field configurations asymptotic to the LDV we show that this energy functional (if defined on a space-like surface) yields the usual (classical) definition of the ADM mass {\it plus a certain ``quantum""-correction. If defined on a null surface the energy functional yields the Bondi mass. The latter is evaluated careflly and applied to the RST shock-wave scenario where it is shown to behave as physically expected. Motivated by the existence of a positivity theorem we construct manifestly supersymmetric (semiclassical) extensions of these quantum-corrected dilaton-gravity theories. "
"A new method to identify the gluon jet in 3-jet ``{\bf Y}'' decays of $Z^0$ is presented. The method is based on differences in particle multiplicity between quark jets and gluon jets, and is more effective than tagging by leptonic decay. An experimental test of the method and its application to a study of the ``string effect'' are proposed. Various jet-finding schemes for 3-jet events are compared. "
"We present spectrophotometric observations of the Broad Line Radio Galaxy OQ 208 (Mrk 668, 1404+286) obtained between 1985 and 1991. We show that the Balmer line fluxes and profile shapes undergo remarkable changes. The ratio of intensities between the broad and narrow components of Hbeta increased monotonically from 15 in 1985 to 40 in 1991. The peak of the broad components of Hbeta and Halpha were known to be strongly displaced to the red. We have discovered a correlation between the amplitude of the broad peak displacement and the luminosity of Hbeta, in the sense that the displacement is larger when the line luminosity is higher. We suggest that the observations are not compatible with either a binary Broad Line Region model or one involving ballistic acceleration of the line emitting gas. Radiative acceleration of a system of outflowing clouds readily explains the correlation between line shift and luminosity as well as the peculiar line profiles. Furthermore, it seems that most or all of the Balmer emission originates from the inward face of the clouds. Theoretical line profiles suggest that the observed Hbeta profile is best fit assuming the contribution of an ensemble which might be spherical or confined in a thick disk in addition to a component emitted in a thin shell contained in a cone of half opening angle 12 degrees seen along its axis.

"A relativistic string is usually represented by the Nambu-Goto action in terms of the extremal area of a 2-dimensional timelike submanifold of Minkowski space. Alternatively, a family of classical solutions of the string equation of motion can be globally described in terms of the associated geodesic field. In this paper we propose a new gauge theory for the geodesic field of closed and open strings. Our approach solves the technical and conceptual problems affecting previous attempts to describe strings in terms of local field variables. The connection between the geodesic field, the string current and the Kalb-Ramond gauge potential is discussed and clarified. A non-abelian generalization and the generally covariant form of the model are also discussed. "
"I discuss the construction of realistic superstring standard--like models in the four dimensional free fermionic formulation. I discuss proton lifetime constraints on superstring models. I discuss the massless spectrum of the superstring standard--like models, the texture of fermion mass matrices in these models and argue that the realistic features of these models are due to the underlying $Z_2\times Z_2$ orbifold compactification. (talk presented at the TEXAS\\PASCHOS conference, Berkeley CA, December 13--18 1992) "
We discuss the influence of glueball coupling to nucleons on the weak axial-vector coupling constants including singlet channel. We consider a possibility of introduction of constituent gluon contribution to the proton spin. The estimated value for this quantity seems to be rather small. 
"We have simulated the three-dimensional Heisenberg model on simple cubic lattices, using the single-cluster Monte Carlo update algorithm. The expected pronounced reduction of critical slowing down at the phase transition is verified. This allows simulations on significantly larger lattices than in previous studies and consequently a better control over systematic errors. In one set of simulations we employ the usual finite-size scaling methods to compute the critical exponents $\nu,\alpha,\beta,\gamma, \eta$ from a few measurements in the vicinity of the critical point, making extensive use of histogram reweighting and optimization techniques. In another set of simulations we report measurements of improved estimators for the spatial correlation length and the susceptibility in the high-temperature phase, obtained on lattices with up to $100^3$ spins. This enables us to compute independent estimates of $\nu$ and $\gamma$ from power-law fits of their critical divergencies. "
"An equivalence between generalised restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) models, associated with sets of graphs, and multi-colour loop models is established. As an application we consider solvable loop models and in this way obtain new solvable families of critical RSOS models. These families can all be classified by the Dynkin diagrams of the simply-laced Lie algebras. For one of the RSOS models, labelled by the Lie algebra pair (A$_L$,A$_L$) and related to the C$_2^{(1)}$ vertex model, we give an off-critical extension, which breaks the Z$_2$ symmetry of the Dynkin diagrams. "
"The field content of the two dimensional string theory consists of the dynamical tachyon field and some nonpropagating fields which consist in the topological sector of this theory. We propose in this paper to study this topological sector as a spacetime gauge theory with a simple centrally extended $w_\infty$ algebra. This $w_\infty$ algebra appears in both the world sheet BRST analysis and the matrix model approach. Since the two dimensional centrally extended Poincar\'e algebra is naturally embedded in the centrally extended $w_\infty$ algebra, the low energy action for the metric and dilaton appears naturally when the model is truncated at this level. We give a plausible explanation of emergence of discrete states in this formulation. This theory is again the effective theory at zero slope limit. To include higher order $\alpha'$ corrections, we speculate that the whole theory is a gauge theory of a deformed $w_\infty$ algebra, and the deformation parameter is just $\alpha'$. "
"By using lessons learned from modern string studies, we show how interesting non-perturbative features of QCD can be learned from future heavy ion collisions even if the deconfinement density is not reached. "
"H.~Yamamoto has proposed employing $B$ mesons produced in conjunction with a single charged pion at an $\Upsilon$ resonance for studies of CP violation in the neutral $B$ meson system at a symmetric $e^+$-$e^-$ collider. The sign of the charged pion would tag the neutral $B$ meson. We estimate this branching ratio, employing the heavy meson chiral effective field theory. We find a negligible branching ratio to $B B^{\pm} \pi^{\mp}$ at the $\Upsilon$(5S) and a branching ratio of only a few percent at the $\Upsilon$(6S). However, if nonresonant studies of neutral $B$ mesons should prove feasible, Yamamoto's proposal could be a good method for tagging neutral $B$'s for the study of CP violation at a symmetric collider. We also explore the possibility of studying $B_s$ at the $\Upsilon$(5S). The rate is low but depends sensitively on the precise value of the mass of the $B_s$. The background we compute is comparable to the rate at the largest allowed value of the $B_s$ mass. Finally, we discuss the extraction of the axial pion coupling to $B$ mesons from measurement of the $B\bbar\pi$ branching fraction in a restricted region of phase space, where chiral perturbation theory should work well. "
"In this paper we examine the behavior in temperature of the free energy on quantum systems in an arbitrary number of dimensions. We define from the free energy a function $C$ of the coupling constants and the temperature, which in the regimes where quantum fluctuations dominate, is a monotonically increasing function of the temperature. We show that at very low temperatures the system is controlled by the zero-temperature infrared stable fixed point while at intermediate temperatures the behavior is that of the unstable fixed point. The $C$ function displays this crossover explicitly. This behavior is reminiscent of Zamolodchikov's $C$-theorem of field theories in 1+1 dimensions. Our results are obtained through a thermodynamic renormalization group approach. We find restrictions on the behavior of the entropy of the system for a $C$-theorem-type behavior to hold. We illustrate our ideas in the context of a free massive scalar field theory, the one-dimensional quantum Ising Model and the quantum Non-linear Sigma Model in two space dimensions. In regimes in which the classical fluctuations are important the monotonic behavior is absent. "
"The correspondence between the braid group on a solid torus of arbitrary genus and the algebra of Yang-Baxter and reflection equation operators is shown. A representation of this braid group in terms of $R$-matrices is given. The characteristic equation of the reflection equation matrix is considered as an additional skein relation. This could lead to an intrinsic definition of invariant link polynomials on solid tori and, via Heegaard splitting, to invariant link polynomials on arbitrary three-manifolds without boundary. "
"We show how to determine the ratio of the transverse velocity of a source to the velocity of emitted particles, using split-bin correlation functions. The technique is to measure $S_2$ and $S_2^{\phi}$, subtract the contributions from the single-particle distribution, and take the ratio as the bin size goes to zero. We demonstrate the technique for two cases: each source decays into two particles, and each source emits a large number of particles. "
We investigate the time neutral formulation of quantum cosmology of Gell-Mann and Hartle. In particular we study the proposal discussed by them that our Universe corresponds to the time symmetric decoherence functional with initial and final density matrix of low entropy. We show that our Universe does not correspond to this proposal by investigating the behaviour of small inhomogeneous perturbations around a Friedman-Robertson-Walker model. These perturbations cannot be time symmetric if they were small at the Big Bang. 
"We examine perturbatively the two-Higgs-doublet extension of the \SM\ in the context of the suspected triviality of theories with fundamental scalars. Requiring the model to define a consistent effective theory for scales below a cutoff of $2\pi$ times the largest mass of the problem, as motivated by lattice investigations of the one-Higgs-doublet model, we obtain combined bounds for the parameters of the model. We find upper limits of 470 GeV for the mass of the light $CP$--even neutral scalar and 650--700 GeV for the other scalar masses. "
"We construct $N=4$ supersymmetric KdV equation as a hamiltonian flow on the $N=4\;SU(2)$ super Virasoro algebra. The $N=4$ KdV superfield, the hamiltonian and the related Poisson structure are concisely formulated in $1D \;N=4$ harmonic superspace. The most general hamiltonian is shown to necessarily involve $SU(2)$ breaking parameters which are combined in a traceless rank 2 $SU(2)$ tensor. First nontrivial conserved charges of $N=4$ super KdV (of dimensions 2 and 4) are found to exist if and only if the $SU(2)$ breaking tensor is a bilinear of some $SU(2)$ vector with a fixed length proportional to the inverse of the central charge of $N=4\;SU(2)$ algebra. After the reduction to $N=2$ this restricted version of $N=4$ super KdV goes over to the $a=4$ integrable case of $N=2$ super KdV and so is expected to be integrable. We show that it is bi-hamiltonian like its $N=2$ prototype. "
"A one--dimensional gas of electrons interacting with long--range Coulomb forces ($V(r) \approx 1/r$) is investigated. The excitation spectrum consists of separate collective charge and spin modes, with the charge excitation energies in agreement with RPA calculations. For arbitrarily weak Coulomb repulsion density correlations at wavevector $4k_F$ decay extremely slowly and are best described as those of a one--dimensional Wigner crystal. Pinning of the Wigner crystal then leads to the nonlinear transport properties characteristic of CDW. The results allow a consistent interpretation of the plasmon and spin excitations observed in one--dimensional semiconductor structures, and suggest an interpretation of some of the observed features in terms of ``spinons''. A possible explanation for nonlinear transport phenomena is given. "
"A real tunneling solution is an instanton for the Hartle-Hawking path integral with vanishing extrinsic curvature (vanishing ``momentum'') at the boundary. Since the final momentum is fixed, its conjugate cannot be specified freely; consequently, such an instanton will contribute to the wave function at only one or a few isolated spatial geometries. I show that these geometries are the extrema of the Hartle-Hawking wave function in the semiclassical approximation, and provide some evidence that with a suitable choice of time parameter, these extrema are the maxima of the wave function at a fixed time. "
"The Seyfert galaxy NGC 6814 is known to show periodic variation of its X-ray luminosity. We found that the sequences of peaks (variability patterns) in the folded X-ray light curves constructed from the {\it Exosat} and {\it Ginga} data are remarkably similar when one ignores amplitudes of the peaks and considers only their phases. The stable pattern consists of five peaks which are present in the both curves. The phases of the corresponding peaks coincide with an accuracy of about 10 degrees. The probability that this coincidence occurs by chance is less than about 1\% according to the most conservative estimate. The observed stable pattern of peaks may be produced by a stable distribution of ``bright spots'' on the accretion disk surface, {\it e.g.} by strong vortices or magnetic flux tubes. "
"We construct model master equations for local quantum dissipation. The master equations are in the form of Lindblad generators, with imposed constraints that the dissipations be strictly linear (i.e. ohmic), isotropic and translationally invariant. A particular form for is chosen to satisfy the constraints. The resulting master equations are given in both the Schr\""odinger and Heisenberg forms. We obtain fluctuation-dissipation relations, and discuss the relaxation of average kinetic energy to effective thermal equilibrium values. We compare our results to the Dekker and the Caldeira-Leggett master equations. These master equations allow a more general approach to quantum dissipation and the dynamics of quantum coherence to account for the nontrivial system-environment coupling in a local environment. "
Physical states of two-dimensional topological gauge theories are studied using the BRST formalism in the light-cone gauge. All physical states are obtained for the abelian theory. There are an infinite number of physical states with different ghost numbers. Simple examples of physical states in a non-abelian theory are also given. 
"We confirm that the diagonal elements of the Gell-Mann and Hartle's decoherence decoherence functional are equal to the relative frequencies of the results of many identical experiments, when a set of alternative histories decoheres. We consider both cases of the pure and mixed initial states. "
"These notes summarize the lectures delivered in the V Mexican School of Particle Physics, at the University of Guanajuato. We give a survey of the application of Ashtekar's variables to the quantization of General Relativity in four dimensions with special emphasis on the application of techniques of analytic knot theory to the loop representation. We discuss the role that the Jones Polynomial plays as a generator of nondegenerate quantum states of the gravitational field. "
An alternative to Plemelj - Smithies formulas for the p -regularized quantities $d^{(p)}(K)$ and $D^{(p)}(K)$ is presented which generalizes previous expressions with $p=1$ due to Grothendieck and Fredholm. It is also presented global upper bounds for these quantities. In particular we prove that $$ |d^{(p)}(K)| \le e^{\kappa \n K \n_p^p} $$ holds with $\kappa = \kappa(p) \le \kappa(\infty) = \exp \bigl\{-{1 \over 4(1+ e^{2 \pi})} \bigr\}$ for $ p\ge 3$ which improves previous estimate yielding $\kappa(p) = e (2 + \ln(p-1))$. 
We present a topological version of two dimensional dilaton supergravity. It is obtained by gauging an extension of the super-Poincar\'e algebra in two space-time dimensions. This algebra is obtained by an unconventional contraction of the super de Sitter algebra. Besides the generators of the super de Sitter algebra it has one more fermionic generator and two more bosonic generators one of them being a central charge. The gauging of this algebra is performed in the usual way. Unlike some proposals for a dilaton supergravity theory we obtain a model which is non-local in the gravitino field. 
"We study the effects of a strongly interacting Higgs sector on the amplitudes for $\gamma\,\gamma\rightarrow W_L^+\,W_L^-, Z_L^{\,0}\,Z_L^{\,0}$ by unitarizing the $W_L^+\,W_L^-, Z_L^{\,0}\,Z_L^{\,0}, \gamma\,\gamma$ system using the $K$--matrix technique. Unitarization produces substantial corrections to the cross sections for gauge boson pair production by photon fusion when $m_H \agt 5-10\;$TeV. "
"Since decays to four leptons is widely considered a promising way to search for the Higgs particle, we show how the same final state can also be used to search for signals of CP nonconservation. Energy asymmetries and triple correlations are related to parameters in the underlying CP violating effective interaction at the $H^0$-$W$-$W$ and $H^0$-$Z$-$Z$ vertex. Expected size of the effects are shown to be small for both the Sandard Model and its extension with an extra Higgs doublet. "
"A cycle expansion for the Lyapunov exponent of a product of random matrices is derived. The formula is non-perturbative and numerically effective, which allows the Lyapunov exponent to be computed to high accuracy. In particular, the free energy and the heat capacity are computed for the one-dimensional Ising model with quenched disorder. The formula is derived by using a Bernoulli dynamical system to mimic the randomness. "
"Using the appropriate representation of the Poincare group and a definition of minimal coupling, we discuss some aspects of the electromagnetic interactions of charged anyons. In a nonrelativistic expansion, we derive a Schrodinger-type equation for the anyon wave function which includes spin-magnetic field and spin-orbit couplings. In particular, the gyromagnetic ratio for charged anyons is shown to be 2; this last result is essentially a reflection of the fact that the spin is parallel to the momentum in (2+1) dimensions. "
"A critical analysis of the conformal approach to the theory of 2d turbulence is delivered. It is shown, in particular, that conformal minimal models cannot give a general turbulent solution, which should provide for constant fluxes of all vorticity integrals of motion. "
It is shown that the field strength formulated Yang-Mills theory yields the same semiclassics as the standard formulation in terms of the gauge potential. This concerns the classical instanton solutions as well as the quantum fluctuations around the instanton. 
The conformal invariant character of $\nu$-multicomponent integrable systems (with $\nu$ branches of gapless excitations) is described from the point of view of the response to curvature of the two-dimensional space. The $\nu\times\nu$ elements of the dressed charge matrix are shown to be transition matrix elements of the zero ($\mu =0$) components of the diagonal generators of $\nu$ independent Kac-Moody algebras (Cartan currents). The dynamical decoupling which occurs in these systems is characterized in terms of the conductivities associated with the $\mu = 1$ components of the Cartan currents. 
The spatially inhomogeneous large $N$ solutions to Kazakov--Migdal model are analyzed. The set of nonlinear differential equations is derived in the continuum limit. In one dimensional case these equations has a natural interpretation in terms of the dynamics of a Fermi gas. The multidimensional case seems to be inconsistent because of its instability related to the collapse of eigenvalues of the scalar field. 
"Intrinsic strangeness contributions to low-energy strange quark matrix elements of the nucleon are modelled using kaon loops and meson-nucleon vertex functions taken from nucleon-nucleon and nucleon-hyperon scattering. A comparison with pion loop contributions to the nucleon electromagnetic (EM) form factors indicates the presence of significant SU(3)-breaking in the mean-square charge radii. As a numerical consequence, the kaon loop contribution to the mean square Dirac strangeness radius is significantly smaller than could be observed with parity-violating elastic ep experiments planned for CEBAF, while the contribution to the Sachs radius is large enough to be observed with PV electron scattering from (0^+,0) nuclei. Kaon loops generate a strange magnetic moment of the same scale as the isoscalar EM magnetic moment and a strange axial vector form factor having roughly one-third magnitude extracted from nu p/nubar p elastic scattering. In the chiral limit, the loop contribution to the fraction of the nucleon's scalar density arising from strange quarks has roughly the same magnitude as the value extracted from analyses of Sigma_{\pi N}. The importance of satisfying the Ward-Takahashi Identity, not obeyed by previous calculations, is also illustrated, and the sensitivity of results to input parameters is analyzed. "
"We study the electrodynamics of generic charged particles (bosons, fermions, relativistic or not) constrained to move on an infinite plane. An effective gauge theory in 2+1 dimensional spacetime which describes the real electromagnetic interaction of this particles is obtained. The relationship between this effective theory with the Chern-Simons theory is explored. It is shown that the QED lagrangian {\it per se} produces the Chern-Simons constraint relating the current to the effective gauge field in 2+1 D. It is also shown that the geometry of the system unavoidably induces a contribution from the topological $\theta$-term that generates an explicit Chern-Simons term for the effective 2+1 dimensional gauge field as well as a minimal coupling of the matter to it. The possible relation of the effective three dimensional theory with the bosonization of the Dirac fermion field in 2+1 D is briefly discussed as well as the potential applications in Condensed Matter systems. "
"We find an explicit solution of the Schr\""odinger equation for a Chern-Simons theory coupled to charged particles on a Riemann surface, when the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term is a rational number (rather than an integer) and where the total charge is zero. We find that the wave functions carry a projective representation of the group of large gauge transformations. We also examine the behavior of the wave function under braiding operations which interchange particle positions. We find that the representation of both the braiding operations and large gauge transformations involve unitary matrices which mix the components of the wave function. The set of wave functions are expressed in terms of appropriate Jacobi theta functions. The matrices form a finite dimensional representation of a particular (well known to mathematicians) version of the braid group on the Riemann surface. We find a constraint which relates the charges of the particles, $q$, the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term, $k$ and the genus of the manifold, $g$: $q^2(g-1)/k$ must be an integer. We discuss a duality between large gauge transformations and braiding operations. "
"According to recent reports there is an excess correlation and an apparent regularity in the galaxy one-dimensional polar distribution with a characteristic scale of 128 $h^{-1}$ Mpc. This aparent spatial periodicity can be naturally explained by a time oscillation of the gravitational constant $G$. On the other hand, periodic growth features of bivalve and coral fossiles appear to show a periodic component in the time dependence of the number of days per year. In this letter we show that a time oscillating gravitational constant with similar period and amplitude can explain such a feature. "
Random matrix theory of the transition strengths is applied to transport in the strongly localized regime. The crossover distribution function between the different ensembles is derived and used to predict quantitatively the {\sl universal} magnetoconductance curves in the absence and in the presence of spin-orbit scattering. These predictions are confirmed numerically. 
"We use mirror symmetry to establish the first concrete arena of spacetime topology change in string theory. In particular, we establish that the {\it quantum theories} based on certain nonlinear sigma models with topologically distinct target spaces can be smoothly connected even though classically a physical singularity would be encountered. We accomplish this by rephrasing the description of these nonlinear sigma models in terms of their mirror manifold partners--a description in which the full quantum theory can be described exactly using lowest order geometrical methods. We establish that, for the known class of mirror manifolds, the moduli space of the corresponding conformal field theory requires not just two but {\it numerous} topologically distinct Calabi-Yau manifolds for its geometric interpretation. A {\it single} family of continuously connected conformal theories thereby probes a host of topologically distinct geometrical spaces giving rise to {\it multiple mirror manifolds}. "
"We consider the quantum-mechanical algebra of observables generated by canonical quantization of $SL(2,R)$ Chern-Simons theory with rational charge on a space manifold with torus topology. We produce modular representations generalizing the representations associated to the $SU(2)$ WZW models and we exhibit the explicit polynomial representations of the corresponding fusion algebras. The relation to Kac-Wakimoto characters of highest weight $\widehat{sl}(2)$ representations with rational level is illustrated. Talk given at the Como Conference on ``Integrable Quantum Field Theories'', September 1992. "
"It is shown that the striking energy variation in the $p\, d \rightarrow \mbox{$^{\, 3}{\rm He}$}\, \eta$ cross section near threshold is probably due to a final state interaction associated with a large (complex) $\eta -\mbox{$^{3}{\rm He}$}$ scattering length. The consequences of this hypothesis are studied for the production of the meson in the $\eta -\mbox{$^{4}{\rm He}$}$ and $\eta -\mbox{$^{7}{\rm Be}$}$ channels. "
"It has been suggested recently by Gan, Coleman, and Andrei that studying the underscreened Kondo problem may help to understand the nature of magnetism in heavy fermion systems. Motivated by Doniach's work on the S=1/2 Kondo necklace, we introduce the underscreened Kondo necklace models with S>1/2. The underscreened Kondo necklace is the simplest lattice model on which the competition between Kondo spin compensation, and magnetic ordering due to an RKKY-type interaction can be examined. We used the mean-field approximation to determine the phase diagram, and found that the low-temperature phase is always an x-y antiferromagnet. This contention is further supported by the derivation of the exact form of the effective hamiltonian in the limit of very large Kondo coupling: it is found to be an antiferromagnetic x-y model for the residual (S-1/2)-spins. In general, the degree of moment compensation depends on both the Kondo coupling, and on S. "
"If string theory describes nature, then charged black holes are not described by the Reissner-Nordstrom solution. This solution must be modified to include a massive dilaton. In the limit of vanishing dilaton mass, the new solution can be found by a generalization of the Harrison transformation for the Einstein-Maxwell equations. These two solution generating transformations and the resulting black holes are compared. It is shown that the extremal black hole with massless dilaton can be viewed as the ``square root"" of the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom solution. When the dilaton mass is included, extremal black holes are repulsive, and it is energetically favorable for them to bifurcate into smaller holes. (To appear in the Festschrift for Dieter Brill) "
"In recent work a multimonopole solution of heterotic string theory was obtained. The monopoles are noted to be stable, in contrast with analogous solutions of Einstein-Maxwell or Yang-Mills-dilaton theory. The existence of this and other classes of stable solitonic solutions in string theory thus provides a possible test for low-energy string theory as distinct from other gauge + gravity theories. "
"Fermions scattering off first-order phase transition bubbles, in the framework of $SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R\otimes U(1)$ models, may generate the Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe (BAU), either at the $LR$-symmetry-breaking scale, or at the weak scale. In the latter case, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe is related to CP violation in the $K_0$--$\bar K_0$ system. "
"We report on the recent progress in computing the effective supergravity action from superstring scattering amplitudes beyond the tree approximation. We discuss the moduli-dependent string loop corrections to gauge, gravitational and Yukawa couplings. "
"We discuss the effects of surfaces on bulk plasma oscillations in a metallic film of thickness $L$. The leading corrections to the plasma frequencies due to the surfaces are proportional to $L^{-1}$. dispersion relation of bulk modes, $\omega=\omega_p[1+\alpha(q^2/k_F^2)] $, where the allowed $q$-values are $q^{(n)}=(n\pi/\overline L)$, $\overline L\equiv L-2d_b$, and $d_b$ is a complex length characteristic of the surface (reminiscent of but different from Feibelman's $d_\perp$). An explicit expression for $d_b$ is derived. Resonant excitation by an external field, $E_0e^{-i\omega t}$, is calculated. "
In this paper I discuss how the component structure of anyon wave functions arises in theories with non-relativistic matter coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field on the torus. It is shown that there exists a singular gauge transformation which brings the Hamiltonian to free form. The gauge transformation removes a degree of freedom from the Hamiltonian. This degree of freedom generates only a finite dimensional Hilbert space and is responsible for the component structure of free anyon wave functions. This gives an understanding of the need for multiple component anyon wave functions from the point of view of Chern-Simons theory. 
"We present sum representations for all characters of the unitary Virasoro minimal models. They can be viewed as fermionic companions of the Rocha-Caridi sum representations, the latter related to the (bosonic) Feigin-Fuchs-Felder construction. We also give fermionic representations for certain characters of the general $(G^{(1)})_k \times (G^{(1)})_l \over (G^{(1)})_{k+l}}$ coset conformal field theories, the non-unitary minimal models ${\cal M}(p,p+2)$ and ${\cal M}(p,kp+1)$, the $N$=2 superconformal series, and the $\ZZ_N$-parafermion theories, and relate the $q\to 1$ behaviour of all these fermionic sum representations to the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz. "
"We show that certain models for neutrino masses that lead to the MSW explanation of the solar neutrino data and/or the hot dark matter component in the universe can also naturally allow for the successful generation of the cosmological baryon asymmetry at the electroweak scale. This follows either because the experimental Higgs boson mass limit is weakened due to the smaller production rate and the presence of sizeable invisible decays involving majoron emission, or due to the effect of additional electrically charged scalar bosons which substantially modify the condition for succesful baryogenesis. "
We write down and solve a closed set of Schwinger-Dyson equations for the two-matrix model in the large $N$ limit. Our elementary method yields exact solutions for correlation functions involving angular degrees of freedom whose calculation was impossible with previously known techniques. The result sustains the hope that more complicated matrix models important for lattice string theory and QCD may also be solvable despite the problem of the angular integrations. As an application of our method we briefly discuss the calculation of wavefunctions with general matter boundary conditions for the Ising model coupled to $2D$ quantum gravity. Some novel insights into the relationship between lattice and continuum boundary conditions are obtained. 
"In the same way the folding of the Dynkin diagram of A_{2n} (resp. A_{2n-1}) produces the B_n (resp. C_n) Dynkin diagram, the symmetry algebra W of a Toda model based on B_n (resp. C_n) can be seen as resulting from the folding of a W-algebra based on A_{2n} (resp. A_{2n-1}). More generally, W algebras related to the B-C-D algebra series can appear from W algebras related to the unitary ones. Such an approach is in particular well adapted to obtain fusion rules of W algebras based on non simply laced algebras from fusion rules corresponding to the A_n case. Anagously, super W algebras associated to orthosymplectic superalgebras are deduced from those relative to the unitary A(m,n) series. "
"A quark model which includes both scalar and vector contributions to the reaction mechanism is used in a DWBA calculation of total and differential cross-sections, polarizations, and spin correlation coefficients for the reaction $\bar p p \rightarrow \bar \Lambda \Lambda$ at laboratory momenta from threshold to 1.92 GeV/c. The free parameters of the calculation include the scalar and vector strengths, a quark cluster size parameter, and six parameters in the unknown $\bar \Lambda \Lambda$ interaction. Excellent agreement with experiment is found for a constructive interference of scalar and vector terms, and for a $\bar \Lambda \Lambda$ potential which differs from that suggested by several authors on the basis of SU(3) arguments. The fit to the data is better than that obtained by other quark models, which use only scalar or vector annihilation terms. The agreement with experiment is as good as that found in meson-exchange models, which use more parameters than the present calculation. "
In this paper we consider symplectic and Hamiltonian structures of systems generated by actions of sigma-model type and show that these systems are naturally connected with specific symplectic geometry on loop spaces of Riemannian and (pseudo)Riemannian manifolds. 
"We prove that the dimensions of coinvariants of certain nilpotent subalgebras of the Virasoro algebra do not change under deformation in the case of irreducible representations of (2,2r+1) minimal models. We derive a combinatorial description of these representations and the Gordon identities from this result. "
"This is a study of the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence, and related matters, using linear sigma models. "
"Braiding matrices in rational conformal field theory are considered. The braiding matrices for any two block four point function are computed, in general, using the holomorphic properties of the blocks and the holomorphic properties of rational conformal field theory. The braidings of $SU(N)_k$ with the fundamental are evaluated and are used as examples. Solvable interaction round the face lattice models are constructed from these braiding matrices, and their Boltzmann weights are given. This allows, in particular, for the derivation of the Boltzmann weights of such solvable height models. "
We demonstrate that a relativistic constituent-quark model can give nucleon form factors in agreement with data for both low and high momentum transfer. The relativistic features of the model and the specific form of the wave function are essential for the result. 
"We study the real time formalism of non-equilibrium many-body theory, in a first quantised language. We argue that on quantising the relativistic scalar particle in spacetime with Minkowski signature, we should study both propagations $e^{i(p^2-m^2)\tilde \lambda}$ and $e^{-i(p^2-m^2)\tilde \lambda}$ on the particle world line. The path integral needs regulation at the mass shell $p^2=m^2$. If we regulate the two propagations independently we get the Feynman propagator in the vacuum, and its complex conjugate. But if the regulation mixes the two propagations then we get the matrix propagator appropriate to perturbation theory in a particle flux. This formalism unifies the special cases of thermal fluxes in flat space and the fluxes `created' by Cosmological expansion, and also gives covariance under change of particle definition in curved space. We comment briefly on the proposed application to closed strings, where we argue that coherent fields and `exponential of quadratic' particle fluxes must {\it both} be used to define the background for perturbation theory. "
We consider an $SU(3)_L\otimes U(1)_N$ model for the electroweak interactions which includes extra charged leptons which do not mix with the known leptons. These new leptons couple to $Z^0$ only through vector currents. We consider constraints on the mass of one of these leptons coming from the $Z^0$-width and from the muon $(g-2)$ factor. The last one is less restrictive than the former. 
"We examine analytically and numerically the evolution of a relativistic fireball. We show that, after an early rearrangement phase, most of the matter and energy in the fireball is concentrated within a narrow shell. The shell propagates at nearly the speed of light, with a frozen radial profile and according to a simple set of scaling laws. The spectrum of the escaping radiation is harder at early times and softer later on. The results are applicable to models of $\gamma$-ray bursts. Submitted to Monthly Notices of the RAS Figures available on request from the authors "
"We present an effective quantum action for the gauged WZW model $G_{-k}/H_{-k}$. It is conjectured that it is valid to all orders of the central extension $(-k)$ on the basis that it reproduces the exact spacetime geometry of the zero modes that was previously derived in the algebraic Hamiltonian formalism. Besides the metric and dilaton, the new results that follow from this approach include the exact axion field and the solution of the geodesics in the exact geometry. It is found that the axion field is generally non-zero at higher orders of $1/k$ even if it vanishes at large $k$. We work out the details in two specific coset models, one non-abelian, i.e. $SO(2,2)/SO(2,1)$ and one abelian, i.e $SL(2,\IR)\otimes SO(1,1)^{d-2}/SO(1,1)$. The simplest case $SL(2,\IR)/\IR$ corresponds to a limit. "
"We estimate the entropy associated to a background of squeezed cosmic gravitons, and we argue that the process of cosmological pair production from the vacuum may explain the large amount of entropy of our present universe. "
"We suggest that the sextet color condensation model is not only the simplest and most attractive scheme to modify the standard model but also may already have some ``experimental"" support. The crucial test may be to observe a short-- lived axion--like $\eta_6$ of mass around 60 GeV/$c^2$ that can produce high energy photon pairs diffractively at hadron colliders and also radiatively from $Z^0$ at high energy $e^+ e^-$ colliders. Here we show how high--energy forward scattering can be affected by diffractive production of the $\eta_6$. Presented to the DPF-92 meeting. "
"Field strength formulated Yang-Mills theory is confronted with the traditional formulation in terms of gauge fields. It is shown that both formulations yield the same semiclassics, in particular the same instanton physics. However, at the tree level the field strength approach is superior because it already includes a good deal of of quantum fluctuations of the standard formulation. These quantum fluctuations break the scale invariance of classical QCD and give rise to an instanton interaction and this causes the instantons to condense and form a homogeneous instanton solid. Such the instanton solids show up in the field strength approach as homogeneous (constant up to gauge transformations) vacuum solutions. A new class of SU(N) instantons is presented which are not embeddings of SU(N-1) instantons but have non-trivial SU(N) color structure and carry winding number $n=N(N^{2}-1)/6$. These instantons generate (after condensation) the lowest action solutions of the field strength approach. The statistical weight (entropy) of different homogeneous solutions for SU(3) is numerically estimated by Parisi's stochastic quantization method. Finally, we compare instanton induced quark condensation with the condensation of quarks in the homogeneous field strength solutions. Our investigations show that the homogeneous vacuum of the field strength approach simulates in an efficient way a condensate of instantons. "
"We construct the hierarchical wave function of the spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall effect, which turns out to satisfy Fock cyclic condition. The spin-statistics relation of the quasi-particles in the spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall effect is also discussed. Then we use particle-hole conjugation to check the wave function. "
"An infinite number of free field realizations of the universal nonlinear $\hat{W}_{\infty}^{(N)}$ ($\hat{W}_{1+\infty}^{(N)}$) algebras, which are identical to the KP Hamiltonian structures, are obtained in terms of $p$ plus $q$ scalars of different signatures with $p-q=N$. They are generalizations of the Miura transformation, and naturally give rise to the modified KP hierarchies via corresponding realizations of the latter. Their characteristic Lie-algebraic origin is shown to be the graded $SL(p,q)$. "
"We show that longwavelength excitations of the quark-gluon plasma are described by simple kinetic equations which represent the exact equations of motion at leading order in $g$. Properties of the so-called ``hard thermal loops'', i.e. the dominant contributions to amplitudes with soft external lines, find in this approach a natural explanation. In particular, their generating functional appears here as the effective action describing long wavelength excitations of the plasma. "
"We investigate an extension of the Singlet Majoron Model in which the breaking of dilatation symmetry by the mass parameters of the scalar potential is removed by means of a dilaton field. Starting from the one-loop renormalization group improved potential, we discuss the ground state of the theory. The flat direction in the classical potential is lifted by quantum corrections and the true vacua are found. Studying the finite temperature potential, we analyze the cosmological consequences of a Jordan-Brans-Dicke dilaton and show that the lepton number is spontaneously broken after the electroweak phase transition, thus avoiding any constraint coming from the requirement of the preservation of the baryon asymmetry in the early Universe. We also find that, contrary to the Standard Model case, the dilaton cosmology does not impose any upper bound on the scale of the spontaneous breaking of scale invariance. "
"I show that the gravitational scattering amplitudes of a spin-5/2 field with mass $m\ll M_{Pl}$ violate tree-level unitarity at energies $\sqrt{s}\approx\sqrt{mM_{Pl}}$ if the coupling to gravity is minimal. Unitarity up to energies $\sqrt{s}\approx M_{Pl}$ is restored by adding a suitable non-minimal term, which gives rise to interactions violating the (strong) equivalence principle. These interactions are only relevant at distances $d\lequiv 1/m$. "
"We describe a method to study the rate at which modes decorrelate in numerical simulations. We study the XY model updated with the Metropolis and Wolff dynamics respectively and compute the rate at which each eigenvector of the dynamics decorrelates. Our method allows us to identify the decorrelation time for each mode separately. We find that the autocorrelation function of the various modes is markedly different for the `local' Metropolis compared to the `non-local' Wolff dynamics. Equipped with this new insight, it may be possible to devise highly efficient algorithms. "
"We study the conformal groups of Jordan algebras along the lines suggested by Kantor. They provide a natural generalization of the concept of conformal transformations that leave 2-angles invariant to spaces where ""p-angles"" can be defined. We give an oscillator realization of the generalized conformal groups of Jordan algebras and Jordan triple systems(JTS). These results are extended to Jordan superalgebras and super JTS's. We give the conformal algebras of simple Jordan algebras, hermitian JTS's and the simple Jordan superalgebras as classified by Kac. "
"The level spacing distributions in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble, both in the ``bulk of the spectrum,'' given by the Fredholm determinant of the operator with the sine kernel ${\sin \pi(x-y) \over \pi(x-y)}$ and on the ``edge of the spectrum,'' given by the Airy kernel ${\rm{Ai}(x) \rm{Ai}'(y) - \rm{Ai}(y) \rm{Ai}'(x) \over (x-y)}$, are determined by compatible systems of nonautonomous Hamiltonian equations. These may be viewed as special cases of isomonodromic deformation equations for first order $ 2\times 2 $ matrix differential operators with regular singularities at finite points and irregular ones of Riemann index 1 or 2 at $\infty$. Their Hamiltonian structure is explained within the classical R-matrix framework as the equations induced by spectral invariants on the loop algebra ${\tilde{sl}(2)}$, restricted to a Poisson subspace of its dual space ${\tilde{sl}^*_R(2)}$, consisting of elements that are rational in the loop parameter. "
We calculate the electric flux and magnetic monopole current distribution in the presence of a static quark-antiquark pair for SU(2) lattice gauge theory in the maximal Abelian gauge. The current distribution confines the flux in a dual Abrikosov vortex whose core size is comparable to the flux penetration depth. The observed structure is described by a dual Ginzburg-Landau model. 
"The Livermore Supernova Explosion Code was used to calculate the effect of a massive Dirac neutrino on neutrino emission from SN 1987A in a fully self-consistent manner. Spin-flip interactions lead to the copious emission of sterile, right-handed neutrinos and cool the core faster than the observed neutrino emission time for Dirac masses exceeding about 3$\,$keV. This limit is relaxed to $7\,$keV if pion emission processes in the core are neglected. These limits are compared with the previous less stringent limits of Burrows et al. "
"We present an analytic formula for the $O(\alpha_s)$ corrections to the decay $t\to H^+b$ for nonzero $m_H$ and $m_b$. The Equivalence Theorem is used to relate these corrections to those for the process $t\to W^+b$. Contrary to previously published results we find that the effect of the $b$ quark mass is negligible for a wide range of $m_t$, $m_H$ and $\tan \beta$. "
"Using both analytic and numerical methods, we study the radial growth probability distribution $P(r,M)$ for large scale off lattice diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) clusters. If the form of $P(r,M)$ is a Gaussian, we show analytically that the width $\xi(M)$ of the distribution {\it can not} scale as the radius of gyration $R_G$ of the cluster. We generate about $1750$ clusters of masses $M$ up to $500,000$ particles, and calculate the distribution by sending $10^6$ further random walkers for each cluster. We give strong support that the calculated distribution has a power law tail in the interior ($r\sim 0$) of the cluster, and can be described by a scaling Ansatz $P(r,M) \propto {r^\alpha\over\xi}\cdot g\left( {r-r_0}\over \xi \right)$, where $g(x)$ denotes some scaling function which is centered around zero and has a width of order unity. The exponent $\alpha$ is determined to be $\approx 2$, which is now substantially smaller than values measured earlier. We show, by including the power-law tail, that the width {\it can} scale as $R_G$, if $\alpha > D_f-1$. "
"Measurement is a fundamental notion in the usual approximate quantum mechanics of measured subsystems. Probabilities are predicted for the outcomes of measurements. State vectors evolve unitarily in between measurements and by reduction of the state vector at measurements. Probabilities are computed by summing the squares of amplitudes over alternatives which could have been measured but weren't. Measurements are limited by uncertainty principles and by other restrictions arising from the principles of quantum mechanics. This essay examines the extent to which those features of the quantum mechanics of measured subsystems that are explicitly tied to measurement situations are incorporated or modified in the more general quantum mechanics of closed systems in which measurement is not a fundamental notion. There, probabilities are predicted for decohering sets of alternative time histories of the closed system, whether or not they represent a measurement situation. Reduction of the state vector is a necessary part of the description of such histories. Uncertainty principles limit the possible alternatives at one time from which histories may be constructed. Models of measurement situations are exhibited within the quantum mechanics of the closed system containing both measured subsystem and measuring apparatus. Limitations are derived on the existence of records for the outcomes of measurements when the initial density matrix of the closed system is highly impure. (Festschrift for Dieter Brill). "
We investigate the evolution of small perturbations around black strings and branes which are low energy solutions of string theory. For simplicity we focus attention on the zero charge case and show that there are unstable modes for a range of time frequency and wavelength in the extra $10-D$ dimensions. These perturbations can be stabililized if the extra dimensions are compactified to a scale smaller than the minimum wavelength for which instability occurs and thus will not affect large astrophysical black holes in four dimensions. We comment on the implications of this result for the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis. 
"As shown by Witten the N=1 supersymmetric gauged WZW model based on a group G has an extended N=2 supersymmetry if the gauged subgroup H is so chosen that G/H is Kahler. We extend Witten's result and prove that the N=1 supersymmetric gauged WZW models over G X U(1) are actually invariant under N=4 superconformal transformations if the gauged subgroup H is such that G/HXSU(2) is a quaternionic symmetric space. A previous construction of ""maximal"" N=4 superconformal algebras with SU(2)XSU(2)XU(1) symmetry is reformulated and further developed so as to relate them to the N=4 gauged WZW models. Based on earlier results we expect the quantization of N=4 gauged WZW models to yield the unitary realizations of maximal N=4 superconformal algebras provided by this construction. "
"Requirements for correlation measurements in high--multiplicity events are discussed. Attention is focussed on detection of so--called hot spots, two--particle rapidity correlations, two--particle momentum correlations (for quantum interferometry) and higher--order correlations. The signal--to--noise ratio may become large in the high--multiplicity limit, allowing meaningful single--event measurements, only if the correlations are due to collective behavior. "
"A positive mass theorem for General Relativity Theory is proved. The proof is 4-dimensional in nature, and relies completely on arguments pertaining to causal structure, the basic idea being that positive energy-density focuses null geodesics, and correspondingly retards them, whereas a negative total mass would advance them. Because it is not concerned with what lies behind horizons, this new theorem applies in some situations not covered by previous positivity theorems. Also, because geodesic focusing is a global condition, the proof might allow a generalisation to semi-classical gravity, even though quantum violations of local energy conditions can occur there. "
"We propose an approach to statistical systems on lattices with sphere-like topology. Focusing on the Ising model, we consider the thermodynamic limit along a sequence of lattices which preserve the {\em fixed} large scale geometry. The hypothesis of scaling appears to hold at criticality, pointing at a sensible definition of the continuum limit of the model in the curved space. "
It is well known that the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries may lead to conflict with big-bang cosmology. This is due to formation of domain walls which give unacceptable contribution to the energy density of the universe. On the other hand it is expected that gravity breaks global symmetries explicitly. In this work we propose that this could provide a natural solution to the domain-wall problem. 
"In this talk new formulations of the Green--Schwarz heterotic strings in $D$ dimensions that involve commuting spinors, are reviewed. These models are invariant under $n$--extended, world sheet supersymmetry as well as under $N=1$, target space supersymmetry where $n\leq D-2$ and $D=3,4,6,10$. The world sheet supersymmetry replaces $n$ components (and provides a geometrical meaning) of the $\kappa$--symmetry in the Green--Schwarz approach. The models in $D=10$ for $n=1,2,8$ are discussed explicitly. "
We show that it is consistent with ZFC that all filters which have the Baire property are Lebesgue measurable. We also show that the existence of a Sierpinski set implies that there exists a nonmeasurable filter which has the Baire property. 
"Dynamical friction due to field stars and tidal disruption caused by a central nucleus are crucial in determining the evolution of the globular cluster system in an elliptical galaxy. In this paper I examine the possibility that some of galactic nuclei have been formed by frictionally decayied globular clusters moving in a triaxial potential. The initial rapid growth of the nucleus, due mainly to massive clusters on box orbits falling in a short time scale into the galactic centre, is found to be later slowed by tidal disruption induced by the nucleus itself on less massive clusters in the way described by Ostriker, Binney & Saha. The efficiency of dynamical friction is such to carry to the centre of the galaxy enough globular cluster mass available to form a compact nucleus, but the actual modes of its collisionless formation remains to be investigated. The mass of the resulting nucleus is determined by the mutual feedback of the two mentioned processes, together with the knowlegde of the initial spatial, velocity and mass distributions of the globular cluster family. Moreover, we discuss the possibility that the globular cluster fall to the galactic centre has been cause of primordial violent galactic activity. An application of the model to M31 is presented. "
"We calculate both analytically and numerically the evolution of a highly relativistic fireball through the stages of free expansion and coasting, and determine the dependence of the thermodynamic and radiation variables in the comoving and laboratory frames. Magnetic fields may have been important in the original impulsive event. We discuss their effect on the fireball dynamics, and consider also their effects on the radiation emitted when the fireball runs into an external medium and is decelerated. The inverse synchro-Compton mechanism can then yield high radiative efficiency in the reverse shock, producing a burst of non-thermal radiation mainly in the MeV to GeV range whose total energy and duration agree with those of typical cosmic gamma ray bursts. "
A new construction is given of non-standard uniserial modules over certain valuation domains; the construction resembles that of a special Aronszajn tree in set theory. A consequence is the proof of a sufficient condition for the existence of non-standard uniserial modules; this is a theorem of ZFC which complements an earlier independence result. 
"A classical lattice gas model with translation-invariant finite range competing interactions, for which there does not exist an equivalent translation-invariant finite range nonfrustrated potential, is constructed. The construction uses the structure of nonperiodic ground state configurations of the model. In fact, the model does not have any periodic ground state configurations. However, its ground state - a translation-invariant probability measure supported by ground state configurations - is unique. "
"We show in two simple examples that for one-dimensional quantum chains with quantum group symmetries, the correlation functions of local operators are, in general, infrared divergent. If one considers, however, correlation functions invariant under the quantum group, the divergences cancel out. "
"We consider the implications of the recent results of SAGE and GALLEX experiments for the solution of the solar neutrino problem in the framework of the resonant neutrino spin-flavor precession scenario. It is shown that this scenario is consistent with all the existing solar neutrino data including the gallium results. The quality of the fit of the data depends crucially on the magnetic field profile used which makes it possible to get information about the magnetic field in the solar interior. In particular, the magnetic field in the core of the sun must not be too strong ($<3 \times 10^6$ G). The detection rate in the gallium detectors turns out to be especially sensitive to the magnitude of $\Delta m^2$. Predictions for forthcoming solar-neutrino experiments are made. "
"Hawking's radiance, even as computed without account of backreaction, departs from blackbody form due to the mode dependence of the barrier penetration factor. Thus the radiation is not the maximal entropy radiation for given energy. By comparing estimates of the actual entropy emission rate with the maximal entropy rate for the given power, and using standard ideas from communication theory, we set an upper bound on the permitted information outflow rate. This is several times the rates of black hole entropy decrease or radiation entropy production. Thus, if subtle quantum effects not heretofore accounted for code information in the radiance, the information that was thought to be irreparably lost down the black hole may gradually leak back out from the black hole environs over the full duration of the hole's evaporation. "
"We study string theory on orbifolds in the presence of an antisymmetric constant background field in detail and discuss some of new aspects of the theory. It is pointed out that the term with the antisymmetric background field can be regarded as a topological term like a Chern-Simons term or a Wess-Zumino term. Detailed analysis in the operator formalism shows that orbifold models with topologically nontrivial twists exhibit various anomalous behavior: Zero mode variables obey nontrivial quantization conditions. Coordinate transformations which define orbifolds are modified at quantum level. Wave functions of twisted strings in general acquire nontrivial phases when they move around non-contractible loops on orbifolds. Zero mode eigenvalues are shifted from naively expected values, in favor of modular invariance. "
"I estimate the degree of local chemical equilibration for $\pi$, $\rho$ and $\omega$ mesons in ultra--relativistic nuclear collisions. The $\pi$ and $\rho$ mesons remain near chemical equilibrium in all cases, while the $\omega$ meson density is typically 30--50\% higher than the equilibrium value for O+Ag collisions at $\sqrt{s}=20$ GeV. If chemical reactions are turned off, the $\omega$ meson density is much larger, 2.5--3 times its equilibrium value. Thus, $\omega$ mesons may provide the most sensitive tests for the degree of chemical equilibration in nuclear collisions. "
(One typo corrected and one incorrect statement removed. Extra details on conserved quantities and symmetry algebras added). 
"We give an example of a countable theory T such that for every cardinal lambda >= aleph_2 there is a fully indiscernible set A of power lambda such that the principal types are dense over A, yet there is no atomic model of T over A. In particular, T(A) is a theory of size lambda where the principal types are dense, yet T(A) has no atomic model. "
"We show that if we enrich first order logic by allowing quantification over isomorphisms between definable ordered fields the resulting logic, L(Q_{Of}), is fully compact. In this logic, we can give standard compactness proofs of various results. Next, we attempt to get compactness results for some other logics without recourse to diamond, i.e., all our results are in ZFC. We get the full result for the language where we quantify over automorphisms (isomorphisms) of ordered fields in Theorem 6.4. Unfortunately we are not able to show that the language with quantification over automorphisms of Boolean algebras is compact, but will have to settle for a close relative of that logic. This is theorem 5.1. In section 4 we prove we can construct models in which all relevant automorphism are somewhat definable: 4.1, 4.8 for BA, 4.13 for ordered fields. We also give a new proof of the compactness of another logic -- the one which is obtained when a quantifier Q_{Brch} is added to first order logic which says that a level tree (definitions will be given later) has an infinite branch. This logic was previously shown to be compact, but our proof yields a somewhat stronger result and provides a nice illustration of one of our methods. "
"A forcing extension may create new isomorphisms between two models of a first order theory. Certain model theoretic constraints on the theory and other constraints on the forcing can prevent this pathology. A countable first order theory is classifiable if it is superstable and does not have either the dimensional order property or the omitting types order property. Shelah [Sh:c] showed that if a theory T is classifiable then each model of cardinality lambda is described by a sentence of L_{infty, lambda}. In fact this sentence can be chosen in the L^*_{lambda}. (L^*_{lambda} is the result of enriching the language L_{infty, beth^+} by adding for each mu < lambda a quantifier saying the dimension of a dependence structure is greater than mu .) The truth of such sentences will be preserved by any forcing that does not collapse cardinals <= lambda and that adds no new countable subsets of lambda. Hence, if two models of a classifiable theory of power lambda are non-isomorphic, they are non-isomorphic after a lambda-complete forcing. Here we show that the hypothesis of the forcing adding no new countable subsets of lambda cannot be eliminated. In particular, we show that non-isomorphism of models of a classifiable theory need not be preserved by ccc forcings. "
"We study a three-parameters family of solutions of the Brans-Dicke field equations. They are static and spherically symmetric. We find the range of parameters for which this solution represents a black hole different from the Schwarzschild one. We find a subfamily of solutions which agrees with experiments and observations in the solar system. We discuss some astrophysical applications and the consequences on the ""no hair"" theorems for black holes. "
Let s(A) denote the number of automorphisms of a model A of power omega_1. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition in terms of trees for the existence of an A with omega_1 < s(A) < 2^{omega_1}. We study the sufficiency of some conditions for s(A)=2^{omega_1}. These conditions are analogous to conditions studied by D.Kueker in connection with countable models. 
"We discuss the quantum mechanics of particles of arbitrary statistics on an infinite cylinder with and without a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface. In the presence of a magnetic field, the translational symmetry along the cylinder is broken down to a discrete one by the Aharonov-Bohm effect. For interacting fermions in a strong field we get an effective one-dimensional lattice model that in a limit can be mapped on an Ising chain. We also show that a system of anyons on a cylinder are, in a certain limit closely related to the one-dimensional (integrable) Sutherland model. By order of magnitude estimates we demonstrate that none of these effects are likely to be experimentally observed with present techniques. "
"We give a strong evidence that noncrystalline materials such as quasicrystals or incommensurate solids are not exceptions but rather are generic in some regions of a phase space. We show this by constructing classical lattice-gas models with translation-invariant, finite-range interactions and with a unique quasiperiodic ground state which is stable against small perturbations of two-body potentials. More generally, we provide a criterion for stability of nonperiodic ground states. "
"The reaction $pp \to W \ +\ \gamma\ +\ jet \ +\ X$ is considered at centre-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} = 16$ and $40\;\tev$, including anomalous three-gauge-boson couplings $\kappa$ and $\lambda$. The possibility of obtaining limits on these quantities by comparison with the standard model is investigated. The radiation zero properties of the subprocess matrix elements are studied. CERN-TH.6753/92, DTP/92/92. "
"The heavy quark self-energy in nonrelativistic lattice QCD is calculated to $O(\alpha_s)$ in perturbation theory. An action which includes all spin-independent relativistic corrections to order $v^2$, where $v$ is the typical heavy quark velocity, and all spin-dependent corrections to order $v^4$ is used. The standard Wilson action and an improved multi-plaquette action are used for the gluons. Results for the mass renormalization, wavefunction renormalization, and energy shift are given; tadpole contributions are found to be large. A tadpole improvement scheme in which all link variables are rescaled by a mean-field factor is also studied. The effectiveness of this scheme in offsetting the large tadpole contributions to the heavy quark renormalization parameters is demonstrated. "
"A theorem of Galvin asserts that if the unordered pairs of reals are partitioned into finitely many Borel classes then there is a perfect set P such that all pairs from P lie in the same class. The generalization to n-tuples for n >= 3 is false. Let us identify the reals with 2^omega ordered by the lexicographical ordering and define for distinct x,y in 2^omega, D(x,y) to be the least n such that x(n) not= y(n). Let the type of an increasing n-tuple {x_0, ... x_{n-1}}_< be the ordering <^* on {0, ...,n-2} defined by i<^*j iff D(x_i,x_{i+1})< D(x_j,x_{j+1}). Galvin proved that for any Borel coloring of triples of reals there is a perfect set P such that the color of any triple from P depends only on its type. Blass proved an analogous result is true for any n. As a corollary it follows that if the unordered n-tuples of reals are colored into finitely many Borel classes there is a perfect set P such that the n-tuples from P meet at most (n-1)! classes. We consider extensions of this result to partitions of infinite increasing sequences of reals. We show, that for any Borel or even analytic partition of all increasing sequences of reals there is a perfect set P such that all strongly increasing sequences from P lie in the same class. "
"In the literature two notions of the word problem for a variety occur. A variety has a decidable word problem if every finitely presented algebra in the variety has a decidable word problem. It has a uniformly decidable word problem if there is an algorithm which given a finite presentation produces an algorithm for solving the word problem of the algebra so presented. A variety is given with finitely many axioms having a decidable, but not uniformly decidable, word problem. Other related examples are given as well. "
"We evaluate the non leptonic decays $B \to D^* \pi \pi$ and $B \to D^* \rho \pi$ in the limit of infinitely heavy quarks, assuming the dominance of intermediate positive parity charmed resonances. We find that the branching ratios are of the order $10^(-3)$. "
In this article we discuss the ground state of a parabolically confined quantum dots in the limit of very strong magnetic fields where the electron system is completely spin-polarized and all electrons are in the lowest Landau level. Without electron-electron interactions the ground state is a single Slater determinant corresponding to a droplet centered on the minimum of the confinement potential and occupying the minimum area allowed by the Pauli exclusion principle. Electron-electron interactions favor droplets of larger area. We derive exact criteria for the stability of the maximum density droplet against edge excitations and against the introduction of holes in the interior of the droplet. The possibility of obtaining exact results in the strong magnetic field is related to important simplifications associated with broken time-reversal symmetry in a strong magnetic field. 
"An error in the gauge fixed quantization of section 3 is corrected. The result is a much simpler treatment of the clock field, leading to a simplification of the gauge fixed quantum theory and the treatment of the semiclassical limit. "
I propose a new mathematical form for the quantum theory of gravity coupled to matter. The motivation is from the connection between CSW TQFT and the Ashtekar variables. I also connect the algebraic structure of TQFT with some thoughts about the interpretation of quantum mechanics in a general relativistic setting. 
Some mistakes have been corrected 
"I discuss methods for identifying and quantifying phase transitions in particle collisions, concentrating on two techniques for use in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions. The first technique is to use rapidity correlation measurements to determine the correlation length, while the second is to use the transverse mass distribution of dileptons in the rho-omega peak to determine the transition temperature. "
"I develop a theory to account for the cosmic ray spectrum. The essential assumption is that, due to fast convective motions, the free mean path perpendicular to the magnetic field is independent of energy and has the scale of the thickness of the shocked layer. I use the basic concept, that the energetic Cosmic Ray particles are accelerated in a Supernova shock that travels down a stellar wind. Discussion gives a knee energy expression, which leads to a suggestion on the physical origin of the mechanical energy of Supernova explosions, the gravitational potential energy mediated by the angular momentum and the magnetic field. The spectrum below the knee is $E^{-8/3}$. At the knee the particles segregate with particle energy according to their charge. The spectrum beyond the knee is very close to $E^{-3}$. The theory has been checked successfully against air shower data in two subsequent papers (Stanev, Biermann, Gaisser, 1992 preprint; Rachen, Stanev, Biermann, 1992 preprint). "
"The implications of the deficit of solar neutrinos are discussed. If all of the experiments are taken literally the relative suppressions render an astrophysical explanation unlikely. Allowing MSW conversions, the data simultaneously determine the temperature of the core of the sun to within five percent. The implications of the atmospheric $\nu_\mu/\nu_e$ ratio are briefly discussed. "
"We show how generic nonabelian gauge fields can be induced in baryons when a hierarchy of fast degrees of freedom is integrated out. We identify them with nonabelian Berry potentials and discuss their role in transmuting quantum numbers in bag and soliton models of baryons. The resulting baryonic spectra for both light and heavy quark systems are generic and resemble closely the excitation spectrum of diatomic molecules. The symmetry restoration in the system, i.e., the electronic rotational invariance in diatomic molecules, the heavy-quark symmetry in heavy baryons etc. is interpreted in terms of the vanishing of nonabelian Berry potentials that otherwise govern the hyperfine splitting. "
"The higher-spin geometries of $W_\infty$-gravity and $W_N$-gravity are analysed and used to derive the complete non-linear structure of the coupling to matter and its symmetries. The symmetry group is a subgroup of the symplectic diffeomorphisms of the cotangent bundle of the world-sheet, and the $W_N$ geometry is obtained from a non-linear truncation of the $W_\infty$ geometry. Quantum W-gravity is briefly discussed. (Talk given at {\it Pathways to Fundamental Interactions}, the 16th John Hopkins Workshop on Current Problems in Particle Theory, Gothenborg, 1992.) "
"The spectrum of anyons confined in harmonic oscillator potential shows both linear and nonlinear dependence on the statistical parameter. While the existence of exact linear solutions have been shown analytically, the nonlinear dependence has been arrived at by numerical and/or perturbative methods. We develop a method which shows the possibility of nonlinearly interpolating spectrum. To be specific we analyse the eigenvalue equation in various asymptotic regions for the three anyon problem. "
We construct a four dimensional topological Quantum Field Theory from a modular tensor category. We complete the proof in the case of SU(2)q at a root of unity. Our construction may be important in the physical interpretation of the Chern Simons state in the Ashtekar variables. 
"In this paper we show that (a) all the known exact solutions of the problem of N-anyons in oscillator potential precisely arise from the collective degrees of freedom, (b) the system is pseudo-integrable ala Richens and Berry. We conclude that the exact solutions are trivial thermodynamically as well as dynamically. "
"Energies of four-quark systems have been extracted in a quenched SU(2) lattice Monte Carlo calculation for two different geometries, rectangular and colinear, with $\beta=2.4$ and lattice size $16^3\times 32$. Also, by going to a lattice $24^3\times 32$ and to $\beta=2.5$, the effect of the finite lattice size and scaling are checked. An attempt is made to understand these results in terms of a model based on interquark two-body potentials but modified very significantly by a phenomenological gluon-field overlap factor. "
"Given a principal G-bundle over a smooth manifold M, with G a compact Lie group, and given a finite-dimensional unitary representation of G, one may define an algebra of functions on the space of connections modulo gauge transformations, the ``holonomy Banach algebra'' H_b, by completing an algebra generated by regularized Wilson loops. Elements of the dual H_b* may be regarded as a substitute for measures on the space of connections modulo gauge transformations. There is a natural linear map from diffeomorphism- invariant elements of H_b* to the space of complex-valued ambient isotopy invariants of framed oriented links in M. Moreover, this map is one-to-one. Similar results hold for a C*-algebraic analog, the ``holonomy C*-algebra.'' These results clarify the relation between diffeomorphism-invariant gauge theories and link invariants, and the framing dependence of the expectation values of products of Wilson loops. "
"We examine the various linkings in space-time of ``ball-like'' and ``ring-like'' topological solitons in certain nonlinear sigma models in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. By going to theories where soliton overlaps are forbidden, these linkings become homotopically nontrivial and can be studied by investigating the topology of the corresponding configuration spaces. Our analysis reveals the existence of topological terms which give the linking number of the world-tubes of distinct species of ball solitons in 2+1 dimensions, or which in 3+1 dimensions count the number of times a ball or ring soliton threads through the center of a ring of a different species. We explicitly construct these terms for our models, and generalize them to cases where soliton overlaps are no longer strictly forbidden so the terms are no longer purely topological. One of the (3+1)-dimensional theories we consider also has topological solitons which consist of two rings (of distinct species) linked in space. "
"We propose a 4-dimensional Kaluza-Klein approach to general relativity in the (2,2)-splitting of space-time using the double null gauge. The associated Lagrangian is equivalent to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian, since it yields the same field equations as the E-H Lagrangian does. It is describable as a (1+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills type gauge theory coupled to (1+1)-dimensional matter fields, where the minimal coupling associated with the diffeomorphism group of the 2-dimensional spacelike fibre space automatically appears. Written in the first-order formalism, our Lagrangian density directly yields a non-zero local Hamiltonian density, where the associated time function is the retarded time. From this Hamiltonian density, we obtain a positive-definite local gravitational energy density. In the asymptotically flat space-times, the volume integrals of the proposed local gravitational energy density over suitable 3-dimensional hypersurfaces correctly reproduce the Bondi and the ADM surface integral, at null and spatial infinity, respectively, supporting our proposal. We also obtain the Bondi mass-loss formula as a negative-definite flux integral of a bilinear in the gravitational currents at null infinity. "
"We investigate the crumpling transition on crystalline random surfaces with extrinsic curvature on lattices up to $64^2$. Our data are consistent with a second order phase transition and we find correlation length critical exponent $\nu=0.89\pm 0.07$. The specific heat exponent, $\alpha=0.2\pm 0.15$, is in much better agreement with hyperscaling than hitherto. The long distance behaviour of tangent-tangent correlation functions confirms that the so-called Hausdorff dimension is $d_H=\infty$ throughout the crumpled phase. "
"If the Higgs particle is never found, one will need an alternative theory for vector boson masses. I propose such a theory involving an antisymmetric tensor potential coupled to a gauge field. "
We find an infinite set of new noncommuting conserved charges in a specific class of perturbed CFT's and present a criterion for their existence.They appear to be higher momenta of the already known commuting conserved currents.The algebra they close consists of two noncommuting$W_\infty$ algebras.We find various Virasoro subalgebras of the full symmetry algebra. It is shown on the examples of the perturbed Ising and Potts models that one of them plays an essencial role in the computation of the correlation functions of the fields of the theory. 
"A simple lattice model inducing a gauge theory is considered. The model describes an interaction of a gauge field to an $N\times N$ complex matrix scalar field transforming as a field in the fundamental representation. In contrast to the Kazakov-Migdal model the model contains only the linear interaction between scalar and gauge lattice fields. This model does not suffer from extra local U(1) symmetries. In an approximation of a translation invariant master field the large N limit of the model is investigated. At large N the gauge fields can be integrated out yielding an effective theory describing an interaction of eigenvalues of the master field. The reduced model exhibits phase transitions at the points $\beta_{\bar {cr}}$ and $\beta _{\underline{cr}}$ and the region $(\beta_{\bar{cr}}, \beta_{\underline{cr}})$ separates the strong and weak regions of the model. To study the behaviour of the model at large $N$ in more systematic way the quenched momentum prescription with constraints for treating the large N limit of gauge theories is used. With the help of the technique of orthogonal polynomials nonlinear equations describing the large N limit of the reduced model {\it with quenching} are presented. "
"A general classification of linear differential and finite-difference operators possessing a finite-dimensional invariant subspace with a polynomial basis (the generalized Bochner problem) is given. The main result is that any operator with the above property must have a representation as a polynomial element of the universal enveloping algebra of some algebra of differential (difference) operators in finite-dimensional representation plus an operator annihilating the finite-dimensional invariant subspace. In low dimensions a classification is given by algebras $sl_2({\bold R})$ (for differential operators in ${\bold R}$) and $sl_2({\bold R})_q$ (for finite-difference operators in ${\bold R}$), $osp(2,2)$ (operators in one real and one Grassmann variable, or equivalently, $2 \times 2$ matrix operators in ${\bold R}$), $sl_3({\bold R})$, $sl_2({\bold R}) \oplus sl_2({\bold R})$ and $gl_2 ({\bold R}) \ltimes {\bold R}^{r+1}\ , r$ a natural number (operators in ${\bold R^2}$). A classification of linear operators possessing infinitely many finite-dimensional invariant subspaces with a basis in polynomials is presented. A connection to the recently-discovered quasi-exactly-solvable spectral problems is discussed. "
"We describe a rearrangement of the standard expansion of the symmetry breaking part of the QCD effective Lagrangian that includes into each order additional terms which in the standard chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) are relegated to higher orders. The new expansion represents a systematic and unambiguous generalization of the standard $\chi$PT, and is more likely to converge rapidly. It provides a consistent framework for a measurement of the importance of additional ``higher order'' terms whose smallness is usually assumed but has never been checked. A method of measuring, among other quantities, the QCD parameters $\hat{m}\langle\bar{q}q\rangle$ and the quark mass ratio $m_s/\hat{m}$ is elaborated in detail. The method is illustrated using various sets of available data. Both of these parameters might be considerably smaller than their respective leading order standard $\chi$PT values. The importance of new, more accurate, experimental information on low-energy $\pi-\pi$ scattering is stressed. "
"There is a good reason why the standard electroweak SU(2) X U(1) gauge model may be supplemented by two Higgs scalar doublets. They may be remnants of the spontaneous breaking of an SU(2) X SU(2) X U(1) gauge symmetry at a much higher energy scale. In one case, the two-doublet Higgs potential has a custodial SU(2) symmetry and implies an observable scalar triplet. In another, a light neutral scalar becomes possible. "
The partition function of two dimensional QCD on a Riemann surface of area $A$ is expanded as a power series in $1/N$ and $A$. It is shown that the coefficients of this expansion are precisely determined by a sum over maps from a two dimensional surface onto the two dimensional target space. Thus two dimensional QCD has a simple interpretation as a closed string theory. 
"We discuss a Gedanken experiment for the measurement of the area of the apparent horizon of a black hole in quantum gravity. Using rather general and model-independent considerations we find a generalized uncertainty principle which agrees with a similar result obtained in the framework of string theories. The result indicates that a minimum length of the order of the Planck length emerges naturally from any quantum theory of gravity, and that the concept of black hole is not operationally defined if the mass is smaller than the Planck mass. "
"We study nuclear structure effects on the transparency in high transverse momentum $(p,2p)$ and $(e,e'p)$ reactions. We show that in the DWIA-eikonal approximation, even when correlations are included, one can get a factorized expression for the transparency. This depends only on the average nucleon density $\rho(r)$ and a correlation function. We develop a technique to include correlations in a Monte-Carlo Glauber type calculation. We compare calculations of $T$ using the eikonal formalism and a continuous density, with a Monte Carlo method based on discrete nucleons. "
"We mapped quiescent 807 GHz CO(7-6) emission from Orion along a strip in RA extending from 0.7 pc west to 1.2 pc east of Ori theta 1C. The lines arise in warm gas with T > 40 K. The line brightness temperature is > 160 K in the di- rection of theta 1C, more than twice the dust temperature, and still exceeds 35 K more than a parsec east of theta 1C. The lines are narrow, with a max- imum velocity width of 7 km s^-1 near theta 1C and decreasing to 1.5-3 km s^-1 at the map boundaries. The density of the emitting gas is > 10^4 cm^-3 and the column density exceeds 10^21 cm^-2. The correlation of the bright, narrow CO(7-6) lines with 158 micron [C II] emission suggests that over the entire region mapped, the narrow CO lines arise in warm photo-dissociation regions ex- cited by UV photons from the Trapezium cluster. Although the Trapezium stars lie in front of the Orion A molecular cloud, not all of the warm gas is at the cloud surface. To the east of theta 1C the CO(7-6) lines split into two velo- city components (also seen in 13CO(2-1) emission) which persist over several arcminutes. Since only one of these components can be on the surface, the other must arise from a dense, UV-illuminated clump or filament within the molecular cloud. Comparison of the quiescent CO(7-6) emission to CO(7-6) ob- served in a cross-map of the energetic Orion KL outflow shows that the lumino- sity of shock-excited CO(7-6) emission in Orion is only a few percent of the luminosity of the widespread quiescent CO(7-6) emission. "
"\small The SL$(2,R)/U(1)$ coset model, with $U(1)$ an element of the third conjugacy class of $SL(2,R)$ subgroups, is considered. The resulting theory is seen to collapse to a one dimensional field theory of Liouville. Then the 2 dimensional black hole $SL(2,R)/U(1)$, with $U(1)$ a non-compact subgroup boosted by a Lorentz transformation, is considered. In the limit of high boost, the resulting black hole is found to tend to the Liouville field coupled to $a\ C=1$ matter field. The limit of the vertex operators of the 2 dimensional black hole also tend to those of the $C=1$ two dimensional gravity. "
A new formulation of fermions based on a second order action is proposed. An analysis of the $U(1)$ anomaly allows us to test the validity of the formalism at the quantum level. This formulation gives a new perpective to the introduction of parity non-invariant interactions. 
"A new formulation for fermions on the lattice based on a discretization of a second order formalism is proposed. A comparison with the first order formalism in connection with the $U(1)$ anomaly and the doubling problem is presented. The new formulation allows to eliminate half of the degrees of freedom, which can be important in non-perturbative calculations, and it can new possibities to the formulation of chiral gauge theories. "
"We present a general scheme for describing su(N)_k fusion rules in terms of elementary couplings, using Berenstein-Zelevinsky triangles. A fusion coupling is characterized by its corresponding tensor product coupling (i.e. its Berenstein-Zelevinsky triangle) and the threshold level at which it first appears. We show that a closed expression for this threshold level is encoded in the Berenstein-Zelevinsky triangle and an explicit method to calculate it is presented. In this way a complete solution of su(4)_k fusion rules is obtained. "
The singular bifurcations in a dispersive billiard are discussed in terms of symbolic dynamics and is compared to an example of a bifurcation tree in a smooth potential. Possible generalizations to other smooth potentials are discussed. 
"Previous results on quasi-classical limit of the KP hierarchy and its W-infinity symmetries are extended to the Toda hierarchy. The Planck constant $\hbar$ now emerges as the spacing unit of difference operators in the Lax formalism. Basic notions, such as dressing operators, Baker-Akhiezer functions and tau function, are redefined. $W_{1+\infty}$ symmetries of the Toda hierarchy are realized by suitable rescaling of the Date-Jimbo-Kashiara-Miwa vertex operators. These symmetries are contracted to $w_{1+\infty}$ symmetries of the dispersionless hierarchy through their action on the tau function. (A few errors in the earlier version is corrected.) "
"We have carried out extensive statistical, bit level and visual tests of several random number generators used in the applications of physics. Two of the generators tested were recently included in a paper by Ferrenberg {\it et al.} (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 68}, 3382 (1992)) who reported correlations in their Monte Carlo simulations. As a possible explanation of this, they suggest bit level correlations in the random numbers. However, our tests find no evidence of such correlations, which highlights the importance of more careful physical tests of random number generators. "
"Overwhelming experimental evidence for quarks as real physical constituents of hadrons along with the QCD analogs of the Balmer Formula, Bohr Atom and Schroedinger Equation already existed in 1966. A model of colored quarks interacting with a one-gluon-exchange potential explained the systematics of the meson and baryon spectrum and gave a hadron mass formula in surprising agreement with experiment. The simple quark model dismissed as heresy and witchcraft by the establishment predicted quantum numbers of an enormous number of hadronic states as well as relations between masses, reaction cross sections and electromagnetic properties, all unexplained by other approaches. Further developments leading to QCD included confinement in the large $N_c$ limit, duality, dual resonance and string models, high energy scattering systematics, unified treatment of mesons and baryons, no exotics and no free quarks. "
"We construct a well ordered symbolic dynamics plane for the stadium billiard. In this symbolic plane the forbidden and the allowed orbits are separated by a monotone pruning front, and allowed orbits can be systematically generated by sequences of approximate finite grammars. "
"We show that a left-handed neutrino $\nu_L$ can oscillate into its $CP$- conjugated state $\bar{\nu}_R$ with maximal amplitude, in direct analogy with $K^0-\bar{K}^0$ oscillations. Peculiarities of such oscillations under different conditions are studied. "
"The authors have introduced recently a ``microcanonical functional integral"" which yields directly the density of states as a function of energy. The phase of the functional integral is Jacobi's action, the extrema of which are classical solutions at a given energy. This approach is general but is especially well suited to gravitating systems because for them the total energy can be fixed simply as a boundary condition on the gravitational field. In this paper, however, we ignore gravity and illustrate the use of Jacobi's action by computing the density of states for a nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator. (Festschrift for Dieter Brill) "
Finite size effects in Euclidean ${\rm CP}^{N-1}$ models with periodic boundary conditions are investigated by means of the $1/N$ expansion and by Monte Carlo simulations. Analytic and numerical results for magnetic susceptibility and correlation length are compared and found to agree for small volumes. For large volumes a discrepancy is found and explained as an effect of the physical bound state extension. The leading order finite size effects on the Abelian string tension are computed and compared with simulations finding agreement. Finite size dependence of topological quantities is also discussed. 
"We employ the conformal bootstrap to re-examine the problem of finding the critical behavior of four-Fermion theory at its strong coupling fixed point. Existence of a solution of the bootstrap equations indicates self-consistency of the assumption that, in space-time dimensions less than four, the renormalization group flow of the coupling constant of a four-Fermion interaction has a nontrivial fixed point which is generally out of the perturbative regime. We exploit the hypothesis of conformal invariance at this fixed point to reduce the set of the Schwinger-Dyson bootstrap equations for four-Fermion theory to three equations which determine the scale dimension of the Fermion field $\psi$, the scale dimension of the composite field $\bar{\psi}\psi$ and the critical value of the Yukawa coupling constant. We solve the equations assuming this critical value to be small. We show that this solution recovers the fixed point for the four-fermion interaction with $N$-component fermions in the limit of large $N$ at (Euclidean) dimensions $d$ between two and four. We perform a detailed analysis of the $1/N$-expansion in $d=3$ and demonstrate full agreement with the conformal bootstrap. We argue that this is a useful starting point for more sophisticated computations of the critical indices. "
"It is argued that the observed Thermodynamic Arrow of Time must arise from the boundary conditions of the universe. We analyse the consequences of the no boundary proposal, the only reasonably complete set of boundary conditions that has been put forward. We study perturbations of a Friedmann model containing a massive scalar field but our results should be independent of the details of the matter content. We find that gravitational wave perturbations have an amplitude that remains in the linear regime at all times and is roughly time symmetric about the time of maximum expansion. Thus gravitational wave perturbations do not give rise to an Arrow of Time. However density perturbations behave very differently. They are small at one end of the universe's history, but grow larger and become non linear as the universe gets larger. Contrary to an earlier claim, the density perturbations do not get small again at the other end of the universe's history. They therefore give rise to a Thermodynamic Arrow of Time that points in a constant direction while the universe expands and contracts again. The Arrow of Time does not reverse at the point of maximum expansion. One has to appeal to the Weak Anthropic Principle to explain why we observe the Thermodynamic Arrow to agree with the Cosmological Arrow, the direction of time in which the universe is expanding. "
"The Hamiltonian structure of the monodromy preserving deformation equations of Jimbo {\it et al } is explained in terms of parameter dependent pairs of moment maps from a symplectic vector space to the dual spaces of two different loop algebras. The nonautonomous Hamiltonian systems generating the deformations are obtained by pulling back spectral invariants on Poisson subspaces consisting of elements that are rational in the loop parameter and identifying the deformation parameters with those determining the moment maps. This construction is shown to lead to ``dual'' pairs of matrix differential operators whose monodromy is preserved under the same family of deformations. As illustrative examples, involving discrete and continuous reductions, a higher rank generalization of the Hamiltonian equations governing the correlation functions for an impenetrable Bose gas is obtained, as well as dual pairs of isomonodromy representations for the equations of the Painleve transcendents $P_{V}$ and $P_{VI}$. "
"To study the behavior of the Kazakov-Migdal at large N the quenched momentum prescription with constraints for treating the large N limit of gauge theories is used. It is noted that it leads to a quartic dependence of an action on unitary matrix instead of a quadratic dependence discussed in previous considerations. Therefore the model is not exactly solvable in the weak coupling limit. An approximation procedure for investigation of the model is outlined. In this approximation an indication to a phase transition for $d<4,8$ with $\beta_{cr}=\frac{1}{d-4,8}$ is obtained. "
"In the formulation of Banks, Peskin and Susskind, we show that one can construct evolution equations for the quantum mechanical density matrix $\rho$ with operators which do not commute with hamiltonian which evolve pure states into mixed states, preserve the normalization and positivity of $\rho$ and conserve energy. Furthermore, it seems to be different from a quantum mechanical system with random sources. "
"We define a Chern- Simons Lagrangian for a system of planar particles topologically interacting at a distance. The anyon model appears as a particular case where all the particles are identical. We propose exact N-body eigenstates, set up a perturbative algorithm, discuss the case where some particles are fixed on a lattice, and also consider curved manifolds. PACS numbers: 05.30.-d, 11.10.-z "
The moduli dependent Yukawa couplings between twisted sectors of ${\bf Z}_M\times {\bf Z}_N$ Coxeter orbifolds are studied. 
"Yukawa coupling constant unification together with the known fermion masses is used to constrain SO(10) models. We consider the case of one (heavy) generation, with the tree-level relation $m_b=m_\tau$, calculating the limits on the intermediate symmetry breaking scales. This analysis extends previous analyses which addressed only the simplest symmetry breaking schemes. In the case where the low energy model is the standard model with one Higgs doublet, there are very strong constraints due to the known limits on the top mass and the tau neutrino mass. The two Higgs doublet case is less constrained. Finally we address the role of a speculative constraint on the tau neutrino mass, arising from the cosmological implications of anomalous $B+L$ violation in the early universe. "
"We construct the $N=2$ super $W_4$ algebra as a certain reduction of the second Gel'fand-Dikii bracket on the dual of the Lie superalgebra of $N=1$ super pseudo-differential operators. The algebra is put in manifestly $N=2$ supersymmetric form in terms of three $N=2$ superfields $\Phi_i(X)$, with $\Phi_1$ being the $N=2$ energy momentum tensor and $\Phi_2$ and $\Phi_3$ being conformal spin $2$ and $3$ superfields respectively. A search for integrable hierarchies of the generalized KdV variety with this algebra as Hamiltonian structure gives three solutions, exactly the same number as for the $W_2$ (super KdV) and $W_3$ (super Boussinesq) cases. "
"Orbits in different dispersive billiard systems, e.g. the 3 disk system, are mapped into a topological well ordered symbol plane and it is showed that forbidden and allowed orbits are separated by a monotone pruning front. The pruning front can be approximated by a sequence of finite symbolic dynamics grammars. "
"We consider a string with uniform energy density and tension and with a number of pointlike masses attached at fixed interdistances. We evaluate the effective interaction forces between these masses induced by the quantum fluctuations of the string. For interdistances large compared to the thickness of the string and small compared to the total length, these forces are universal and attractive and fall off, for large distances as $1/r^3$ and for small distances as $1/r$. The attractive nature of these forces creates an instability under which masses added to the string tend to aggregate. "
"We show that a special superconformal coset (with $\hat c =3$) is equivalent to $c=1$ matter coupled to two dimensional gravity. This identification allows a direct computation of the correlation functions of the $c=1$ non-critical string to all genus, and at nonzero cosmological constant, directly from the continuum approach. The results agree with those of the matrix model. Moreover we connect our coset with a twisted version of a Euclidean two dimensional black hole, in which the ghost and matter systems are mixed. "
We show that at arbitrary value of the scalar self coupling and small Yukawa coupling $y$ the 2d Higgs-Yukawa model with Z(2) symmetry remains in the broken phase and the model is asymptotically free: $y \to 0$ as the cut-off $\Lambda \to \infty$. This is in agreement with a recent conjecture based on numerical simulation results. 
"Assuming the QCD multipole expansion is applicable to hadronic transitions of Upsilon(3S) into lower level bottomonia, we consider the possibility that Upsilon(3S) has a D-wave component. This assumption leads to a natural explanation of the pi-pi spectrum in Upsilon(3S) -> Upsilon(1S) pi-pi. Consequences of this assumption on other hadronic and radiative transitions of Upsilon(3S) are also discussed in the same context. "
The \nl \cls for the N=1 supersymmetric KdV equation are shown to be related in a simple way to powers of the fourth root of its Lax operator. This provides a direct link between the supersymmetry invariance and the existence of \nl conservation laws. It is also shown that nonlocal conservation laws exist for the two integrable N=2 supersymmetric KdV equations whose recursion operator is known. 
"A relativistic extension of the particle-particle hole-hole ring-diagram many-body formalism is developed by using the Dirac equation for single-particle motion in the medium. Applying this new formalism, calculations are performed for nuclear matter. The results show that the saturation density is improved and the equation of state becomes softer as compared to corresponding Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations. Using the Bonn A potential, nuclear matter is predicted to saturate at an energy per nucleon of --15.30 MeV and a density equivalent to a Fermi momentum of 1.38 fm$^{-1}$, in excellent agreement with empirical information. The compression modulus is 152 MeV at the saturation point. "
"In 1988 Serrano \cite{Ser}, using Reider's method, discovered a minimal bielliptic surface in $\PP^4$. Actually he showed that there is a unique family of such surfaces and that they have degree 10 and sectional genus 6. In this paper we describe, among other things, the geometry of the embedding of the minimal bielliptic surfaces. A consequence of this description will be the existence of smooth nonminimal bielliptic surfaces of degree 15 in $\PP^4$. We also explain how to construct the degree 15 surfaces with the help of the quadro-cubic Cremona transformation of $\PP^4$. Finally, we remark that the quintic elliptic scroll and the abelian and bielliptic surfaces of degree 10 and 15 are essentially the only smooth irregular surfaces known in $\PP^4$ (all others can be derived via finite morphisms $\PP^4\to\PP^4 $). "
"We consider the possibility of detecting a heavy Higgs boson ($m_H>2m_Z$) in proposed $\gamma\gamma$ colliders through the semi-leptonic mode $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow H \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow q\bar q \ell^+\ell^-$. We show that due to the non-monochromatic nature of the photon beams produced by the laser-backscattering method, the resultant cross section for Higgs production is much smaller than the on-resonance cross section and generally {\it decreases} with increasing collider energy. Although continuum $ZZ$ production is expected to be negligible, we demonstrate the presence of and calculate sizeable backgrounds from $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-Z,\,q\bar qZ$, with $Z\rightarrow q\bar q,\,\ell^+\ell^-$, respectively, and $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow t\bar t\rightarrow b\bar b\ell^+\ell^-\nu\bar\nu$. This channel may be used to detect a Higgs of mass $m_H$ up to around 350~GeV at a 0.5~TeV $e^+e^-$ collider, assuming a nominal yearly luminosity of 10--20~fb$^{-1}$. "
We demonstrate with soluble models how to employ the effective Hamiltonian approach of Lee and Suzuki to obtain all the exact eigenvalues of the full Hamiltonian. We propose a new iteration scheme to obtain the effective Hamiltonian and demonstrate its convergence properties. 
We present a `supersymmetric' modification of the $d$-dimensional quantum rotor model whose ground state is exactly soluble. The model undergoes a vortex-binding transition from insulator to metal as the rotor coupling is varied. The Hamiltonian contains three-site terms which are relevant: they change the universality class of the transition from that of the ($d+1$)--- to the $d$-dimensional classical XY model. The metallic phase has algebraic ODLRO but the superfluid density is identically zero. Variational wave functions for single-particle and collective excitations are presented. 
"We show how to quantize the anyon particle theory in the gauge $A_x=0$, where the statistical potential $\vec A(\vec x)$ is a Dirac string. In this gauge, anyons obey normal statistics. "
The $\eta_6$ is a ``heavy axion'' remnant of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking by a color sextet quark condensate. Electroweak scale color instanton interactions allow it to be both very massive and yet be responsible for Strong CP conservation in the color triplet quark sector. It may have been seen at LEP via its two-photon decay mode and at TRISTAN via its hadronic decay modes. 
"Four apparently different bosonizations of the $U_q(su(2)_k)$ quantum current algebra for arbitrary level $k$ have recently been proposed in the literature. However, the relations among them have so far remained unclear except in one case. Assuming a special standard form for the $U_q(su(2)_k)$ quantum currents, we derive a set of general consistency equations that must be satisfied. As particular solutions of this set of equations, we recover two of the four bosonizations and we derive a new and simpler one. Moreover, we show that the latter three, and the remaining two bosonizations which cannot be derived directly from this set of equations since by construction they do not have the standard form, are all related to each other through some redefinitions of their Heisenberg boson oscillators. "
"Relations among fermion masses and mixing angles at the scale of grand unification are modified at lower energies by renormalization group running induced by gauge and Yukawa couplings. In supersymmetric theories, the $b$ quark and $\tau$ lepton Yukawa couplings, as well as the $t$ quark coupling, may cause significant running if $\tan \beta$, the ratio of Higgs field expectation values, is large. We present approximate analytic expressions for the scaling factors for fermion masses and CKM matrix elements induced by all three third generation Yukawa couplings. We then determine how running caused by the third generation of fermions affects the predictions arising from three possible forms for the Yukawa coupling matrices at the GUT scale: the Georgi-Jarlskog, Giudice, and Fritzsch textures. "
We perform a complete next to leading order evaluation of inclusive neutral pion production from hadronic colliders which is based on the knowledge of the pion fragmentation functions at next to leading order. This problem has been tackled for the first time using different approaches. Predictions at LHC are given with the estimate of the theoretical uncertainty. 
"Wilson loops have been measured at strong coupling, $\beta=0.5$, on a $12^4$ lattice in noncompact simulations of pure SU(2) without gauge fixing. There is no sign of quark confinement. "
We consider the QCD sum rules approach for Delta-isobar magnetic form factor in the infra-red region $0<Q^2<1GeV^2$. The QCD sum rules in external variable field are used. The obtained formfactor is in agreement with quark model predictions for the Delta-isobar magnetic moment. 
"Aside from primordial gravitational instability of the cosmological fluid, various mechanisms have been proposed to generate large-scale structure at relatively late times, including, e.g., ``late-time'' cosmological phase transitions. In these scenarios, it is envisioned that the universe is nearly homogeneous at the time of last scattering and that perturbations grow rapidly sometime after the primordial plasma recombines. On this basis, it was suggested that large inhomogeneities could be generated while leaving relatively little imprint on the cosmic microwave background (MBR) anisotropy. In this paper, we calculate the minimal anisotropies possible in any ``late-time'' scenario for structure formation, given the level of inhomogeneity observed at present. Since the growth of the inhomogeneity involves time-varying gravitational fields, these scenarios inevitably generate significant MBR anisotropy via the Sachs-Wolfe effect. Moreover, we show that the large-angle MBR anisotropy produced by the rapid post-recombination growth of inhomogeneity is generally greater than that produced by the same inhomogeneity grown via gravitational instability. In ``realistic'' scenarios one can decrease the anisotropy compared to models with primordial adiabatic fluctuations, but only on very small angular scales. The value of any particular measure of the anisotropy can be made small in late-time models, but only by making the time-dependence of the gravitational field sufficiently ``pathological''. "
"We examine the strong coupling limit of both compact and non compact QED on a lattice with staggered fermions. We show that every SU(N) antiferromagnet with spins in a particular fundamental representation of the SU(N) Lie Algebra and with nearest neighbor couplings on a bipartite lattice is exactly equivalent to the infinite coupling limit of lattice QED with the numbers of flavors of electrons related to N and the dimension of spacetime D+1. We find that,for both compact and noncompact QED,when N is odd the ground state of the strong coupling limit breaks chiral symmetry in any dimensions and for any N and the condensate is an isoscalar mass operator. When N is even,chiral symmetry is broken if D is bigger or equal to 2 and N is small enough and the order parameter is an isovector mass operator. We also find the exact ground state of the lattice Coulomb gas as well as a variety of related lattice statistical systems with long ranged interactions. "
"We consider the hot spots in FR-II galaxies as sites of first order Fermi acceleration of protons to the highest energies observed in cosmic rays. We estimate the attainable maximum energy in the hot spot region allowed by the canonical physical conditions, which are found from radio-to-optical observations (Meisenheimer et al. 1989, A&A). We calculate observable the proton flux and spectrum from this sources, using all knowledge about source distibution (Peacock 1985, MNRAS) and particle transport in the microwave background (Berezinsky and Grigor'eva 1988, A&A). We get excellent agreement with the cosmic ray data points at ultra high energies. THIS PAPER GIVES THE FUNDAMENTAL MODEL FOR THE EXPLANATION OF THE NEW AIR SHOWER DATA OF THE PROTON COMPONENT OF THE COSMIC RAY SPECTRUM BETWEEN 0.1 AND 1 EeV (Gaisser et al. 1992, Phys. Rev. D in press, Stanev et al. 1992, A&A submitted), which is subject of a subsequent paper (part II, Rachen and Biermann 1992, A&A submitted). "
"Magnetic flux penetration in superconductors involves a rich variety of subtle phenomena, much of which is still poorly understood. Here these complexities are studied by formulating the Ginzburg-Landau equations as a lattice gauge theory. Their solutions are compared and contrasted with the (heuristic) Landau model of type I superconductivity, and the (perturbative) Abrikosov model for type II superconductors. Novelties arise as the continuum limit is approached, related to an effect discovered by Hofstadter. Various cautionary remarks pertinent to large-scale simulations are made. "
"Summary talk presented at the Conference on Lattice Field Theory, Amsterdam, September, 1992. Abstract: The status of several proposals for defining a theory of chiral fermions on the lattice is reviewed and some new estimates for the upper bound on the Higgs mass are presented. "
"Existing predictions for the branching ratio for $\phi\rightarrow K\bar{K}\gamma$ {\it via} $\phi\rightarrow S\gamma$ (where $S$ denotes one of the scalar mesons $f_0$(975) and $a_0$(980)) vary by several orders of magnitude. Given the importance of these processes for both hadron spectroscopy and CP-violation studies at $\phi$ factories (where $\phi \rightarrow K^0 \bar K^0 \gamma$ poses a possible background problem), this state of affairs is very undesirable. We show that the variety of predictions is due in part to errors and in part to differences in modelling. The latter variation leads us to argue that the radiative decays of these scalar states are interesting in their own right and may offer unique insights into the nature of the scalar mesons. As a byproduct we find that the branching ratio for $\phi\rightarrow K^0\bar{K}^0\gamma$ is $\lapproxeq 0(10^{-7})$ and will pose no significant background to proposed studies of CP-violation. "
"These lectures review some of the basic properties of $N=2$ superconformal field theories and the corresponding topological field theories. One of my basic aims is to show how the techniques of topological field theory can be used to compute effective \LG potentials for perturbed $N=2$ superconformal field theories. In particular, I will briefly discuss the application of these ideas to $N=2$ supersymmetric quantum integrable models. (Lectures given at the Summer School on High Energy Physics and Cosmology, Trieste, Italy, June 15th -- July 3rd, 1992. To appear in the proceedings.) "
We consider the $ su(n) $ spin chains with long range interactions and the spin generalization of the Calogero-Sutherland models. We show that their properties derive from a transfer matrix obeying the Yang-Baxter equation. We obtain the expression of the conserved quantities and we diagonalize them. 
"Product forms of characters of Virasoro minimal models are obtained which factorize into $(2,\odd)\times(3,\even)$ characters. These are related by generalized Rogers-Ramanujan identities to sum forms allowing for a quasiparticle interpretation. The corresponding dilogarithm identities are given and the factorization is used to analyse the related path space structure as well as the fusion of the maximally extended chiral algebra. "
"A diagrammatic technique is derived for calculating processes involving the production of large numbers of particles. As an example, the amplitude of three particles scattering into $n$ particles at the kinematical threshold in $\lambda\phi^4$ theory is calculated. From the $3 \to n$ amplitude, it is seen that the one-loop amplitude for $2 \to n$ processes is suppressed by a factor of $1/n$. "
"The Symmetry charges associated with the Lian-Zuckerman states for $d<2$ closed string theory are constructed. Unlike in the open string case, it is shown here that the symmetry charges commute among themselves and act trivially on all the physical states. "
"We study the dynamical critical behavior of multigrid Monte Carlo for the two dimensional Sine Gordon model on lattices up to 128 x 128. Using piecewise constant interpolation, we perform a W-cycle (gamma=2). We examine whether one can reduce critical slowing down caused by decreasing acceptance rates on large blocks by doing more work on coarser lattices. To this end, we choose a higher cycle with gamma = 4. The results clearly demonstrate that critical slowing down is not reduced in either case. "
"We present a general formulation of the nonlinear, time-dependent current through a small interacting region, where electron energies are changed by time-dependent voltages. An exact solution is obtained for the non-interacting case when the elastic coupling to the leads is independent of energy. Temporal phase coherence in a double-barrier tunneling structure produces ``ringing"" in the response of the current to a voltage pulse, which can be observed experimentally in the dc-current by varying the pulse length in a train of voltage pulses. The nonlinear current due to an ac-bias also shows complex time-dependence. "
"We present a scheme for the analytic computation of renormalization functions on the lattice, using a symbolic manipulation computer language. Our first nontrivial application is a new three-loop result for the topological susceptibility. "
"Recently, string theory on Calabi--Yau manifolds was constructed and was shown to be a fully consistent, space--time supersymmetric string theory. The physically interesting case is the case of three generations. Intriguingly, it appears at the present that there is a unique manifold which gives rise to three generations. We describe in this paper a full fledged string theory on this manifold in which the complete spectrum and all the Yukawa couplings can be computed exactly. "
We examine the possibility of fermion mass generation in 2+1- dimensional gauge theory from the current algebra point of view.In our approach the critical behavior is governed by the fluctuations of pions which are the Goldstone bosons for chiral symmetry breaking. Our analysis supports the existence of an upper critical number of Fermion flavors and exhibits the explicit form of the gap equation as well as the form of the critical exponent for the inverse correlation lenght of the order parameter 
Momentum distribution of fragments produced in 12C+12C reaction at 28.7 MeV/nucleon is analyzed with antisymmetrized version of molecular dynamics (AMD). Calculations are made for several cases of stochastic collisions and the projectile fragmentation peak in momentum distribution is reproduced by the incorporation of many-body nature in stochastic collision process. Furthermore the value of the cross section is found to be reflected in the low momentum part of fragments such as alpha particles and 9Be. 
"We present the theory of two-dimensional, clean quantum antiferromagnets with a small, positive, zero temperature ($T$) stiffness $\rho_s$, but with the ratio $k_B T / \rho_s $ arbitrary. Universal scaling forms for the uniform susceptibility ($\chi_u$), correlation length($\xi$), and NMR relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) are proposed and computed in a $1/N$ expansion and by Mont\'{e}-Carlo simulations. For large $k_B T/\rho_s$, $\chi_u (T)/T$ and $T\xi(T)$ asymptote to universal values, while $1/T_{1}(T)$ is nearly $T$-independent. We find good quantitative agreement with experiments and some numerical studies on $La_{2-\delta} Sr_{\delta} Cu O_4$. "
"Relations between the total beta+ Gamow-Teller (GT+) strength and the E2 strength are further examined. It is found that in shell-model calculations for N=Z nuclei, in which changes in deformation are induced by varying the single-particle energies, the total GT+ or GT- strength decreases monotonically with increasing values of the B(E2) from the ground state to the first excited J=2+ state. Similar trends are also seen for the double GT transition amplitude (with some exceptions) and for the spin part of the total M1 strength as a function of B(E2). "
"We consider a one-dimensional continuous (Kronig-Penney) extension of the (tight-binding) Random Dimer model of Dunlap et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 65, 88 (1990)]. We predict that the continuous model has infinitely many resonances (zeroes of the reflection coefficient) giving rise to extended states instead of the one resonance arising in the discrete version. We present exact, transfer-matrix numerical calculations supporting, both realizationwise and on the average, the conclusion that the model has a very large number of extended states. "
"We calculate nuclear shadowing in lepton-deuteron deep inelastic scattering, which arises from the double scattering of the virtual photon from both nucleons in the deuteron. The total correction to the deuteron structure function is found to be less than about 1\% at small Bjorken-x, but dependent on the model deuteron wavefunction. The resulting increase in the corrected neutron structure function is between 1-2\% for x near 0.004, which leads to a 4-10\% decrease in the value of the Gottfried sum obtained recently by the New Muon Collaboration. "
We consider a coset construction of minimal models. We define it rigorously and prove that it gives superconformal minimal models. This construction allows to build all primary fields of superconformal models and to calculate their three-point correlation functions. 
"In the grand-unified models based on SU(15) and SU(16) in which the quarks and leptons are un-unified at the intermediate stages, we show that ${\rm BR}\; (K_L \to \mu e) \leq 10^{-14}$ and ${\rm BR}\; (K^+ \to \pi^+\mu e) \leq 10^{-14}$ despite the presence of leptoquark gauge bosons. Thus, the observation of these processes in the ongoing or upcoming experiments will rule out the models. "
"Critical properties of the Ising model on a stacked triangular lattice, with antiferromagnetic first and second-neighbor in-plane interactions, are studied by extensive histogram Monte Carlo simulations. The results, in conjunction with the recently determined phase diagram, strongly suggest that the transition from the period-3 ordered state to the paramagnetic phase remains in the xy universality class. This conclusion is in contrast with a previous suggestion of mean-field tricritical behavior. "
"A possible way of producing gravitons in the laboratory is investigated. We evaluate the cross section electron + photon $\rightarrow$ electron + graviton in the framework of linearized gravitation, and analyse this reaction considering the photon coming either from a laser beam or from a Compton back-scattering process. "
"Previous results on quasi-classical limit of the KP and Toda hierarchies are now extended to the BKP hierarchy. Basic tools such as the Lax representation, the Baker-Akhiezer function and the tau function are reformulated so as to fit into the analysis of quasi-classical limit. Two subalgebras $\WB_{1+\infty}$ and $\wB_{1+\infty}$ of the W-infinity algebras $W_{1+\infty}$ and $w_{1+\infty}$ are introduced as fundamental Lie algebras of the BKP hierarchy and its quasi-classical limit, the dispersionless BKP hierarchy. The quantum W-infinity algebra $\WB_{1+\infty}$ emerges in symmetries of the BKP hierarchy. In quasi-classical limit, these $\WB_{1+\infty}$ symmetries are shown to be contracted into $\wB_{1+\infty}$ symmetries of the dispersionless BKP hierarchy. "
"Star products on the classical double group of a simple Lie group and on corresponding symplectic grupoids are given so that the quantum double and the ""quantized tangent bundle"" are obtained in the deformation description. ""Complex"" quantum groups and bicovariant quantum Lie algebras are discused from this point of view. Further we discuss the quantization of the Poisson structure on symmetric algebra $S(g)$ leading to the quantized enveloping algebra $U_{h}(g)$ as an example of biquantization in the sense of Turaev. Description of $U_{h}(g)$ in terms of the generators of the bicovariant differential calculus on $F(G_q)$ is very convenient for this purpose. Finally we interpret in the deformation framework some well known properties of compact quantum groups as simple consequences of corresponding properties of classical compact Lie groups. An analogue of the classical Kirillov's universal character formula is given for the unitary irreducible representation in the compact case. "
This paper deals with the dynamics of a simple family of holomorphic diffeomorphisms of $\C^2$: the polynomial automorphisms. This family of maps has been studied by a number of authors. We refer to [BLS] for a general introduction to this class of dynamical systems. An interesting object from the point of view of potential theory is the equilibrium measure $\mu$ of the set $K$ of points with bounded orbits. In [BLS] $\mu$ is also characterized dynamically as the unique measure of maximal entropy. Thus $\mu$ is also an equilibrium measure from the point of view of the thermodynamical formalism. In the present paper we give another dynamical interpretation of $\mu$ as the limit distribution of the periodic points of $f$. 
"It is shown that zero ghost conformal blocks of coset theory G/H are determined uniquely by those of G and H theories. G/G theories are considered as an example, their structure constants and correlation functions on sphere are calculated. "
"We examine the problem of generation mixing in realistic superstring derived standard--like models, constructed in the free fermionic formulation. We study the possible sources of family mixing in these models . In a specific model we estimate the Cabibbo angle. We argue that a Cabibbo angle of the correct order of magnitude can be obtained in these models. "
"An effective analytical method for calculating energy spectra of cosmic-ray muons at large depths of homogeneous media is developed. The method allows to include an arbitrary (decreasing) muon spectrum at the medium boundary and the energy dependence of both discrete (radiative and photonuclear) and continuous (ionization) muon energy losses, with resonable requirements for the high-energy behavior of the initial spectrum and differential cross sections of the muon-matter interactions. (To be published in the Proceedings of the Second NESTOR International Workshop, 19 -- 21 October 1992, Pylos, Greece.) "
"We argue that the analysis of Reimers {\it et al.} [ Phys. Rev. B {\bf 45}, 7295 (1992)] of their Monte Carlo data on the Heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet, which suggests a new universality class, is not conclusive. By re-analysis of their data, we demonstrate asymptotic volume dependence in some thermodynamic quantities, which suggests the possibility that the transition may be first order. "

"Gluon distributions in the carbon and tin nuclei are investigated by using a $Q^2$ rescaling model with parton recombination effects. We obtain strong shadowings in the small $x$ region due to the recombinations. The ratio $G_A(x)/G_N(x)$ in the medium $x$ region is typically 0.9 for medium size nuclei. At large $x$, the ratio becomes large due to gluon fusions from different nucleons. Comparisons with recent New Muon Collaboration data for $G_{Sn} (x)/ G_C (x)$ indicate that more accurate experimental data are needed for testing the model. "
"We investigate possible CP violating effects in $e^+e^-$ annihilation into top quark pairs. One of the interesting observable effects is the difference in production rates between the two CP conjugate polarized states $t_L\bar t_L$ and $t_R\bar t_R$. The result is an asymmetry in the energy spectra of the lepton and the anti-lepton from the heavy quark decays. Another CP-odd observable is the up-down asymmetry of the leptons with respect to the reaction plane. These two asymmetries measure complementarily the absorptive and dispersive form factors of the electric dipole moment. Finally, as an illustration, we calculate the size of the CP violating form factors in a model where the CP nonconservation originates from the Yukawa couplings of a neutral Higgs boson. "
"We study the process of spinodal decomposition in a scalar quantum field theory that is quenched from an equilibrium disordered initial state at $T_i > T_f$ to a final state at $T_f \approx 0$. The process of formation and growth of correlated domains is studied in a Hartree approximation. We find an approximate scaling law for the size of the domains $\xi_D(t) \approx \sqrt{t \xi_0}$ at long times for weakly coupled theories, with $\xi_0$ the zero temperature correlation length. "
"The author's recent results on spectral invariant dense subalgebras of C*-algebras associated with dynamical systems are summarized. If G is a compactly generated polynomial growth Type R Lie group, and the action of G on S(M) (Schwartz functions on a locally compact G-space M) is tempered in a certain sense, then there is a natural smooth crossed product S(G X M) which is dense and spectral invariant in the C*-crossed product C*(G X M). "
"We investigate the variation of the string field action under changes of the string field vertices giving rise to different decompositions of the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. We establish that any such change in the string action arises from a field transformation canonical with respect to the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) antibracket, and find the explicit form of the generator of the infinitesimal transformations. Two theories using different decompositions of moduli space are shown to yield the same gauge fixed action upon use of different gauge fixing conditions. We also elaborate on recent work on the covariant BV formalism, and emphasize the necessity of a measure in the space of two dimensional field theories in order to extend a recent analysis of background independence to quantum string field theory. "
"We investigate the phase diagram of the two dimensional {\it t}-{\it J} model using a recently developed technique that allows to solve the mean-field model hamiltonian with a variational calculation. The accuracy of our estimate is controlled by means of a small parameter $1/q$, analogous to the inverse spin magnitude $1/s$ employed in studying quantum spin systems. The mathematical aspects of the method and its connection with other large-spin approaches are discussed in details. In the large-$q$ limit the problem of strongly correlated electron systems turns in the minimization of a total energy functional. We have performed numerically this optimization problem on a finite but large $L\times L$ lattice. For a single hole the static small-polaron solution is stable unless for small values of $J$, where polarons of increasing sizes have lower energy. At finite doping we recover phase separation above a critical $J$ and for any electron density, showing that the Emery {\it et al.} picture represents the semiclassical behaviour of the {\it t}-{\it J} model. Quantum fluctuations are expected to be very important especially in the small $J$ -- small doping region, where phase separation may also be suppressed. "
In this paper a new quasi-triangular Hopf algebra as the quantum double of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra is presented.Its universal R-matrix is built and the corresponding representation theory are studied with the explict construction for the representations of this quantum double. \newpage 
"We present a detailed investigation of scattering processes in $W_3$ string theory. We discover further physical states with continuous momentum, which involve excitations of the ghosts as well as the matter, and use them to gain a better understanding of the interacting theory. The scattering amplitudes display factorisation properties, with states from the different sectors of the theory being exchanged in the various intermediate channels. We find strong evidence for the unitarity of the theory, despite the unusual ghost structure of some of the physical states. Finally, we show that by performing a transformation of the quantum fields that involves mixing the ghost fields with one of the matter fields, the structure of the physical states is dramatically simplified. The new formalism provides a concise framework within which to study the $W_3$ string. "
"We present a B\""acklund transformation (a discrete symmetry transformation) for the self-duality equations for supersymmetric gauge theories in N-extended super-Minkowski space ${\cal M}^{4|4N}$ for an arbitrary semisimple gauge group. For the case of an $A_1$ gauge algebra we integrate the transformation starting with a given solution and iterating the process we construct a hierarchy of explicit solutions. "
"Let $X$ be a compact toric variety. Let $Hol$ denote the space of based holomorphic maps from $CP^1$ to $X$ which lie in a fixed homotopy class. Let $Map$ denote the corresponding space of continuous maps. We show that $Hol$ has the same homotopy groups as $Map$ up to some (computable) dimension. The proof uses a description of $Hol$ as a space of configurations of labelled points, where the labels lie in a partial monoid determined by the fan of $X$. "
"We present an exploratory calculation of the $I=2$ $\pi-\pi$ scattering amplitude at threshold using Wilson fermions in the quenched approximation, including all the required contractions. We find good agreement with the predictions of chiral perturbation theory even for pions of mass 560-700 MeV. Within the 10\% errors, we do not see the onset of the bad chiral behavior expected for Wilson fermions. We also derive rigorous inequalities that apply to 2-particle correlators and as a consequence show that the interaction in the antisymmetric state of two pions has to be attractive. "
"The configuration-space topology in canonical General Relativity depends on the choice of the initial data 3-manifold. If the latter is represented as a connected sum of prime 3-manifolds, the topology receives contributions from all configuration spaces associated to each individual prime factor. There are by now strong results available concerning the diffeomorphism group of prime 3-manifolds which are exploited to examine the topology of the configuration spaces in terms of their homotopy groups. We explicitly show how to obtain these for the class of homogeneous spherical primes, and communicate the results for all other known primes except the non-sufficiently large ones of infinite fundamental group. "
"Anyonic oscillators with fractional statistics are built on a two-dimensional square lattice by means of a generalized Jordan-Wigner construction, and their deformed commutation relations are thoroughly discussed. Such anyonic oscillators, which are non-local objects that must not be confused with $q$-oscillators, are then combined \`a la Schwinger to construct the generators of the quantum group $SU(2)_q$ with $q=\exp({\rm i}\pi\nu)$, where $\nu$ is the anyonic statistical parameter. "
"We study four dimensional systems of global, axionic and local strings. By using the path integral formalism, we derive the dual formulation of these systems, where Goldstone bosons, axions and missive vector bosons are described by antisymmetric tensor fields, and strings appear as a source for these tensor fields. We show also how magnetic monopoles attached to local strings are described in the dual formulation. We conclude with some remarks. "
The antifields of the Batalin-Vilkovisky Lagrangian quantization are standard antighosts of certain collective fields. These collective fields ensure that Schwinger-Dyson equations are satisfied as a consequence of the gauge symmetry algebra. The associated antibracket and its canonical structure appear naturally if one integrates out the corresponding ghost fields. An analogous Master Equation for the action involving these ghosts follows from the requirement that the path integral gives rise to the correct Schwinger-Dyson equations. 
"A method for nonperturbative path integral calculation is proposed. Quantum mechanics as a simplest example of a quantum field theory is considered. All modes are decomposed into hard (with frequencies $\omega^2 >\omega^2_0$) and soft (with frequencies $\omega^2 <\omega^2_0$) ones, $\omega_0$ is a some parameter. Hard modes contribution is considered by weak coupling expansion. A low energy effective Lagrangian for soft modes is used. In the case of soft modes we apply a strong coupling expansion. To realize this expansion a special basis in functional space of trajectories is considered. A good convergency of proposed procedure in the case of potential $V(x)=\lambda x^4$ is demonstrated. Ground state energy of the unharmonic oscillator is calculated. "
"On simple cubic lattices, we compute low temperature series expansions for the energy, magnetization and susceptibility of the three-state Potts model in D=2 and D=3 to 45 and 39 excited bonds respectively, and the eight-state Potts model in D=2 to 25 excited bonds. We use a recursive procedure which enumerates states explicitly. We analyze the series using Dlog Pade analysis and inhomogeneous differential approximants. "
"We consider the configuration space of the Skyrme model and give a simple proof that loops generated by full spatial rotations are contractible in the even-, and non-contractible in the odd-winding-number sectors. "
"A class of Poisson embeddings of reduced, finite dimensional symplectic vector spaces into the dual space $\Lg_R^*$ of a loop algebra, with Lie Poisson structure determined by the classical split $R$--matrix $R=P_+ - P_-$ is introduced. These may be viewed as equivariant moment maps inducing natural Hamiltonian actions of the ``dual'' group $\LG_R = \LGp \times \LGm$ of a loop group $\LG$ on the symplectic space. The $R$--matrix version of the Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem is used to induce commuting flows determined by isospectral equations of Lax type. The compatibility conditions determine finite dimensional classes of solutions to integrable systems of PDE's, which can be integrated using the standard Liouville-Arnold approach. This involves an appropriately chosen ``spectral Darboux'' (canonical) coordinate system in which there is a complete separation of variables. As an example, the method is applied to the determination of finite dimensional quasi-periodic solutions of the sine-Gordon equation. "
"The book contain detailed explanation of Bethe Ansatz, Quantum Inverse Scattering Method and Algebraic Bether Ansatz as well. Main Models are Nonlinear Schrodinger equation (one dimensional Bose gas), Sine-Gordon and Thiring models. Heisenberg Antiferromagnet and Hubbard models. It is explained in detail, how to calculate correlation functions. "
The electroweak vacuum structure in an external magnetic field close to the lower critical value is considered at finite fermion density. It is shown that the leading effect of the fermions is to reduce the symmetry of the W-pair condensate in the direction of the magnetic field. The energy is minimized by the appearance of a helicoidal structure of the condensate along the magnetic field. 
"We show several kinematical properties that are intrinsic to the Bianchi models with compact spatial sections. Especially, with spacelike hypersurfaces being closed, (A) no anisotropic expansion is allowed for Bianchi type V and VII(A\not=0), and (B) type IV and VI(A\not=0,1) does not exist. In order to show them, we put into geometric terms what is meant by spatial homogeneity and employ a mathematical result on 3-manifolds. We make clear the relation between the Bianchi type symmetry of space-time and spatial compactness, some part of which seem to be unnoticed in the literature. Especially, it is shown under what conditions class B Bianchi models do not possess compact spatial sections. Finally we briefly describe how this study is useful in investigating global dynamics in (3+1)-dimensional gravity. "
"I discuss gauge coupling unification in a class of superstring standard--like models, which are derived in the free fermionic formulation. Recent calculations indicate that the superstring unification scale is at $O(10^{18}GeV)$ while the minimal supersymmetric standard model is consistent with LEP data if the unification scale is at $O(10^{16})GeV$. A generic feature of the superstring standard--like models is the appearance of extra color triplets $(D,{\bar D})$, and electroweak doublets $(\ell,{\bar\ell})$, in vector--like representations, beyond the minimal supersymmetric standard model. I show that gauge coupling unification at $O(10^{18}GeV)$ in the superstring standard--like models can be consistent with LEP data. I present an explicit standard--like model that can realize superstring gauge coupling unification. "
We investigate a potentially large CP violating asymmetry in the neutral Higgs boson decay into a heavy quark pair or a $W^+$--$W^-$ pair. The source of the CP nonconservation is in the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson which can contain both scalar and pseudoscalar pieces. One of the interesting consequence is the different rates of the Higgs boson decays into CP conjugate polarized states. The required final state interactions can be either the strong or the electroweak interactions. The CP violating asymmetry can manifests itself in the asymmetry in the energies of the secondary decay products of these heavy quarks and $W$ bosons. Such asymmetry can be measureable in the future colliders such as SSC or LHC. 
"The classical black hole background of two-dimensional string theory is examined after including the effect of the tachyon field. Keeping all terms upto $O(T^2)$, and making no other approximations, the only consistent classical solution to the resulting dilaton-graviton theory is found to be flat spacetime with a nontrivial dilaton. "
"We examine various predictions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model coupled to minimal supergravity. The model is characterised by a small set of parameters at the unification scale. The supersymmetric particle spectrum at low energy and the spontaneous breaking of the standard model itself are then generated radiatively. The previously considered predictions of the model now include the neutralino relic density which in turn provides bounds on the scale parameters. We find a remarkable consistency among several different constraints which imply all supersymmetric particle masses preferably within the reach of future supercolliders (LHC and SSC). The requirement that the neutralino be the dominant component of (dark) matter in the flat Universe provides a {\em lower} bound on the spectrum of supersymmetric particles beyond the reach of LEP, and most likely also the Tevatron and LEP 200. "
"It is shown that the breaking of the conformal invariance in quantum electrodynamics due to the trace anomaly results in the generation of long wave electromagnetic fields during inflationary stage of the universe evolution. If the coefficient of the logarithmic charge renormalization is large (due to a large number of charged particles species), these primordial electromagnetic fields can be strong enough to create the observed galactic magnetic fields. "
"Using effective lagrangian, we examine the impacts of new physics on the electroweak baryogenesis. By analysing the high dimensional operators relevent to the Higgs potential we point out that the Higgs mass bound required by electroweak baryogenesis can be relaxed to the region allowed by experiments, provided that new physics appears at the TeV scale. "
"We derive the current algebra of supersymmetric principal chiral models with a Wess-Zumino term. At the critical point one obtains two commuting super Kac-Moody algebra as expected, but in general there are intertwining fields connecting both right and left sectors, analogously to the bosonic case. Moreover, in the present supersymmetric extension we have a quadratic algebra, rather than an affine Lie algebra, due to the mixing between bosonic and fermionic fields since the purely fermionic sector displays a Lie algebra as well. "
Recent inelastic-neutron-scattering measurements of a low-energy phonon in Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8 provide enough information to place a lower bound on the energy gap magnitude at precise locations on the Fermi surface. Measurements of a few low-energy phonons should indicate whether the gap symmetry is d_{x^2-y^2}. Further measurements could map out the angle-resolved gap magnitude on the entire Fermi surface. 
The question as to whether neutron acceleration can occur in uniform electromagnetic fields is examined. Although such an effect has been predicted using the canonical equations of motion some doubt has been raised recently as to whether it is in principle observable for a spin 1/2 particle. To resolve this issue a gedanken experiment is proposed and analyzed using a wave packet construction for the neutron beam. By allowing arbitrary orientation for the neutron spin as well as for the electric and magnetic fields a non vanishing acceleration of the center of the neutron wave packet is found which confirms the predictions of the canonical formalism. 
We perform the sewing of two (dual) Ramond reggeon vertices and derive an algorithm by means of which the so obtained four-Ramond reggeon vertex may be explicitly computed at arbitrary oscillator (mass) level. A closed form of the four-vertex is then deduced on the basis of a comparison to all terms obtained by sewing that contain only level zero and one oscillators. Results are presented for both complex fermions and for the previously studied case of real fermions. 
"We outline the basic principles of canonical formalism for the Nambu mechanics---a generalization of Hamiltonian mechanics proposed by Yoichiro Nambu in 1973. It is based on the notion of Nambu bracket which generalizes the Poisson bracket to the multiple operation of higher order $n \geq 3$ on classical observables and is described by Hambu-Hamilton equations of motion given by $n-1$ Hamiltonians. We introduce the fundamental identity for the Nambu bracket which replaces Jacobi identity as a consistency condition for the dynamics. We show that Nambu structure of given order defines a family of subordinated structures of lower order, including the Poisson structure, satisfying certain matching conditions. We introduce analogs of action from and principle of the least action for the Nambu mechanics and show how dynamics of loops ($n-2$-dimensional objects) naturally appears in this formalism. We discuss several approaches to the quantization problem and present explicit representation of Nambu-Heisenberg commutation relation for $n=3$ case. We emphasize the role higher order algebraic operations and mathematical structures related with them play in passing from Hamilton's to Nambu's dynamical picture. "
The formalism based on the equal-time Wigner function of the two-point correlation function for a quantized Klein--Gordon field is presented. The notion of the gauge-invariant Wigner transform is introduced and equations for the corresponding phase-space calculus are formulated. The equations of motion governing the Wigner function of the Klein--Gordon field are derived. It is shown that they lead to a relativistic transport equation with electric and magnetic forces and quantum corrections. The governing equations are much simpler than in the fermionic case which has been treated earlier. In addition the newly developed formalism is applied towards the description of spontaneous symmetry breakdown. 
"Microscopic black holes are sensitive to higher dimension operators in the gravitational action. We compute the influence of these operators on the Schwarzschild solution using perturbation theory. All (time reversal invariant) operators of dimension six are included (dimension four operators don't alter the Schwarzschild solution). Corrections to the relation between the Hawking temperature and the black hole mass are found. The entropy is calculated using the Gibbons-Hawking prescription for the Euclidean path integral and using naive thermodynamic reasoning. These two methods agree, however, the entropy is not equal to 1/4 the area of the horizon. "
"The structure of one-loop divergences of two-dimensional dilaton-Maxwell quantum gravity is investigated in two formalisms: one using a convenient effective action and the other a unique effective action. The one-loop divergences (including surface divergences) of the convenient effective action are calculated in three different covariant gauges: (i) De Witt, (ii) $\Omega$-degenerate De Witt, and (iii) simplest covariant. The on-shell effective action is given by surface divergences only (finiteness of the $S$-matrix), which yet depend upon the gauge condition choice. Off-shell renormalizability is discussed and classes of renormalizable dilaton and Maxwell potentials are found which coincide in the cases of convenient and unique effective actions. A detailed comparison of both situations, i.e. convenient vs. unique effective action, is given. As an extension of the procedure, the one-loop effective action in two-dimensional dilaton-Yang-Mills gravity is calculated. "
The question of the existence of order in two-dimensional isotropic dipolar Heisenberg antiferromagnets is studied. It is shown that the dipolar interaction leads to a gap in the spin-wave energy and a nonvanishing order parameter. The resulting finite N\'eel-temperature is calculated for a square lattice by means of linear spin-wave theory. 
"We investigate the nonleptonic decay of charmed meson into two pseudoscalar mesons using the vector--dominance model, and compare the results with those obtained from the factorization model. In particular, we discuss the role of the annihilation diagrams in the two models. "
"Sum rules originally derived for the M\""ossbauer Effect are applied to weak semileptonic B decays. The sum rules follow from assuming that the decay by electroweak boson emission of an unstable nucleus or heavy quark in a bound system is described by a pointlike coupling to a current which acts only on the decaying object, that the Hamiltonian of the bound state depends on the momentum of the decaying object only in the kinetic energy and that the boson has no final state interactions. The decay rate and the first and second moments of the boson energy spectrum for fixed momentum transfer are shown to be the same as for a noninteracting gas of such unstable objects with a momentum distribution the same as that of the bound state. B meson semileptonic decays are shown to be dominated by the lowest-lying states in the charmed meson spectrum. "
"We apply the one-loop results of the $SU(3)_L\times SU(3)_R$ ChPT suplemented with the inverse amplitude method to fit the available experimental data on $\pi\pi$ and $\pi K$ scattering. With esentially only three parameters we describe accurately data corresponding to six different channels, namely $(I,J)=(0,0), (2,0), (1,1), (1/2,0), (3/2,0)$ and $(1/2,1)$. In addition we reproduce the first resonances of the $(1,1)$ and $(1/2,1)$ channel with the right mass corresponding to the $\rho$ and the $K^*(892)$ particles. "
"This paper presents a simple ball-and-spring model for the propagation of small amplitude vibrations in a granular material. In this model, the positional disorder in the sample is ignored and the particles are placed on the vertices of a square lattice. The inter-particle forces are modeled as linear springs, with the only disorder in the system coming from a random distribution of spring constants. Despite its apparent simplicity, this model is able to reproduce the complex frequency response seen in measurements of sound propagation in a granular system. In order to understand this behavior, the role of the resonance modes of the system is investigated. Finally, this simple model is generalized to include relaxation behavior in the force network -- a behavior which is also seen in real granular materials. This model gives quantitative agreement with experimental observations of relaxation. "
"We study $CP$ violation in the process $e^+e^- \to t\bar{t} \nu\bar{\nu}$ at an $e^+e^-$-TeV collider. As the source of $CP$ violation we assume a two-Higgs doublet model with an explicitly $CP$-noninvariant Higgs potential. Sizeable $CP$-odd observables originating from the subprocess reaction, $W^+W^- \to t\bar{t}$, may arise as a result of finite width effects of the neutral Higgs particles. $CPT$ constraints due to final (initial) state interactions are also taken into account. Numerical estimates of the $CP$ asymmetry are given. "
"We consider a string inspired effective Lagrangian for the graviton and dilaton, containing Einstein gravity at the zero slope limit. The numerical solution of the problem shows asymptotically an inflationary universe. The time is measured by the dilaton, as one expects. The result is independent of the introduction of ad-hoc self interactions for the dilaton field. "
"We formulate the conditions under which a purely bosonic theory (without fermions) containing neutral spin-0 particles and vector (gauge) bosons violates the CP-symmetry through the presence of CP-even and CP-odd operators in the Lagrangian. This is done without reference to explicitly CP-violating scalar sector of extended standard models (SM) with two or more Higgs doublets. The Lagrangian expressed in the mass basis of the spin-0 fields can, however, in certain cirumstances be identified with a part of the CP-violating SM with two Higgs doublets. It is instructive to consider the manifestation of CP-violation in the mass basis since this leads directly to suggestions of genuine CP-signals. "
"The possible role played by vector mesons in inclusive deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering is investigated. In the context of the convolution model, we calculate self-consistently the scaling contribution to the nucleon structure function using the formalism of time-ordered perturbation theory in the infinite momentum frame. Our results indicate potentially significant effects only when the vector meson---nucleon form factor is very hard. Agreement with the experimental antiquark distributions, however, requires relatively soft form factors for the $\pi N$, $\rho N$ and $\omega N$ vertices. "
"The integrable structure of open--closed string theories in the $(p,q)$ conformal minimal model backgrounds is presented. The relation between the $\tau$--function of the closed string theory and that of the open--closed string theory is uncovered. The resulting description of the open--closed string theory is shown to fit very naturally into the framework of the $sl(q,{\rm C})$ KdV hierarchies. In particular, the twisted bosons which underlie and organise the structure of the closed string theory play a similar role here and may be employed to derive loop equations and correlation function recursion relations for the open--closed strings in a simple way. "
Efforts to predict the rare exclusive decay $B\to K^{\ast}\gamma$ from the well known inclusive decay $b\to s\gamma$ are frustrated by the effect of the large recoil momentum. We show how to reduce the large uncertainty in calculating this decay by relating $B\to K^{\ast}\gamma$ to the semileptonic process $B\to\rho e\bar{\nu}$ using the heavy-quark symmetry in B decays and SU(3) flavor symmetry. A direct measurement of the $q^{2}$-spectrum for the semileptonic decay can provide accurate information for the exclusive rare decay. 
"We extend QCD sum rule analysis to moderate energy fixed angle Compton scattering. In this kinematic region there is a strong similarity to the sum rule treatment of electromagnetic form factors, although the four-point amplitude requires a modification of the Borel transform. To illustrate our method, we derive the sum rules for helicity amplitudes in pion Compton scattering and estimate their large-$t$ behavior in the local duality approximation. "
"We have measured some simple matrix elements for pseudoscalar and vector mesons made of Wilson valence quarks and staggered sea quarks at $\beta=5.6$ at sea quark masses $am_q=0.01$ and 0.025. Our measurements include the decay constants of pseudoscalars (including $f_D$), the wave function at the origin (or decay constant) of vector mesons, and the calculation of quark masses from current algebra. The effects of sea quarks on the simulations are small. We make comparisons to quenched simulations at similar values of the lattice spacing ($1/a \simeq 2$ GeV). "
"We study, with various methods (standard large N evaluation of the functional integral for the effective potential, solution of the Schwinger-Dyson equations), the high temperature phase transition for the $N$-component $\phi^4$ theory in the large $N$ limit. Our results fully confirm a previous investigation of the problem, for arbitrary $N$, with the method of the average potential which employs renormalization group ideas. The phase transition is of the second order with an effectively three-dimensional critical behaviour. } "
We study the electroweak phase transition in the minimal extension of the Standard Model: an extra complex singlet with zero vacuum expectation value. The first-order phase transition is strengthened by the cubic term triggered in the one-loop effective potential by the extra boson. Plasma effects are considered to leading order: they shield the cubic terms and weaken the first-order phase transition. We find a region in the parameter space where baryon asymmetry washout is avoided for Higgs masses consistent with present experimental bounds. However in that region the theory becomes non-perturbative for scales higher than $10^{10}\ GeV$. 
"Using the valence-bond-solid (VBS) approach and the Schwinger boson mean field approximation, we study the dependence of the Haldane gap of a spin-1 linear chain Heisenberg antiferromagnet on impurity doping with different spins. The impurity spins affect the singlet pairing order parameter $\Delta $ and the constraint factor $\lambda$. As a result, the Haldane gap is reduced by a factor $ \sim n_i^{2/3}$, with $n_i$ as the impurity concentration, and eventually collapses at $n_i \sim 1/\xi$ with $\xi$ as the VBS correlation length. This theoretical prediction can be verified by neutron scattering experiments. "
"We calculate the dominant three body Higgs decays, $H \to W^+W^-(Z^0, \gamma)$ and $H \to t\overline{t}(Z^0,\gamma ,g)$, in the Standard Model. We find that the branching ratios of these decays are of the order of few percent for large Higgs masses. We comment on the behaviour of the partial decay width $\Gamma (H \to t\overline{b}W^-)$ below the $t\overline{t}$ threshold. Numerical results of the following three body top decays, $t \to W^+b(\gamma ,g,Z^0)$ and $t \to W^+bH$, are also given. We discuss the feasibility of observing these Higgs and top decays at future high energy colliders. "
A new proof of perturbative renormalizability and infrared finiteness for a scalar massless theory is obtained from a formulation of renormalized field theory based on the Wilson renormalization group. The loop expansion of the renormalized Green functions is deduced from the Polchinski equation of renormalization group. The resulting Feynman graphs are organized in such a way that the loop momenta are ordered. It is then possible to analyse their ultraviolet and infrared behaviours by iterative methods. The necessary subtractions and the corresponding counterterms are automatically generated in the process of fixing the physical conditions for the ``relevant'' vertices at the normalization point. The proof of perturbative renormalizability and infrared finiteness is simply based on dimensional arguments and does not require the usual analysis of topological properties of Feynman graphs. 
"We discuss the structure of a gravitational euclidean instanton obtained through coupling of gravity to electromagnetism. Its topology at fixed $t$ is $S^1\times S^2$. This euclidean solution can be interpreted as a tunnelling to a hyperbolic space (baby universe) at $t=0$ or alternatively as a static wormhole that joins the two asymptotically flat spaces of a Reissner--Nordstr\""om type solution with $M=0$. "
"The astrophysical $S$-factor for the reaction $^7$Be(p,$\gamma$)$^8$B up to an energy of 2~MeV (c.m.) and the capture cross section of $^7$Li(n,$\gamma$)$^8$Li up to 1~MeV (c.m.) are calculated using the Direct Capture model (DC). Both calculations are in good agreement with experimental data. "
"The observed replication of fermions in three families is undoubtedly a reflection of a deeper symmetry underlying the standard model. In this paper we investigate one very elementary possibility, that physics above the grand unification scale is described by the symmetry group $G\timesSU(3)_{fam}$ with $G$ a gauged grand unified group, and $SU(3)_{fam}$ a global family symmetry. The breaking of this symmetry at the GUT scale produces global texture, providing a mechanism for structure formation in the universe, and sets strong constraints on the low energy fermion mass matrix. With the addition of a ${\bf 45}$ Higgs and certain assumptions about the relative strength of Higgs couplings, the simplest $SU(5)$ theory yields an eight parameter form for the fermion mass matrices, which we show is consistent with the thirteen observable masses and mixing angles. We discuss the natural suppression of flavour changing neutral currents (FCNCs) and emphasise the rich low energy Higgs sector. With minor assumptions, the theory unifies consistently with the recent LEP data. We consider the extension to $G=SO(10)$, where some simplification and further predictiveness emerges. Finally we discuss the dynamics of $SU(3)_{fam}$ texture and show that the known constraints on unification `predict' a GUT symmetry breaking scale of the order required for cosmic structure formation, and by the recent detection of cosmic microwave anisotropy by COBE. "
"CP violation can be observed in B decays when a given process depends upon interference between two weak amplitudes which have different $CP$-violating phases. Since most weak decay diagrams have quark lines where each has a definite flavor label, neutral mesons which are flavor mixtures are particularly interesting. Different diagrams can contribute to the different flavor components of the meson, and the wave function itself provides interference. "
"The interaction between an ultrarelativistic particle and a linear array made up of $N$ two-level systems (^^ ^^ AgBr"" molecules) is studied by making use of a modified version of the Coleman-Hepp Hamiltonian. Energy-exchange processes between the particle and the molecules are properly taken into account, and the evolution of the total system is calculated exactly both when the array is initially in the ground state and in a thermal state. In the macroscopic limit ($N \rightarrow \infty$), the system remains solvable and leads to interesting connections with the Jaynes-Cummings model, that describes the interaction of a particle with a maser. The visibility of the interference pattern produced by the two branch waves of the particle is computed, and the conditions under which the spin array in the $N \rightarrow \infty$ limit behaves as a ^^ ^^ detector"" are investigated. The behavior of the visibility yields good insights into the issue of quantum measurements: It is found that, in the thermodynamical limit, a superselection-rule space appears in the description of the (macroscopic) apparatus. In general, an initial thermal state of the ^^ ^^ detector"" provokes a more substantial loss of quantum coherence than an initial ground state. It is argued that a system decoheres more as the temperature of the detector increases. The problem of ^^ ^^ imperfect measurements"" is also shortly discussed. "
We apply the self consistency method for determining critical exponents to a model with a four fermi interaction coupled to QED and compute various gauge independent exponents in arbitrary dimensions in the large $N$ expansion at $O(1/N)$. The formalism is developed to include a Chern Simons term in three dimensions and the effect such a term has on the exponents is deduced. 
"We calculate the gauge-boson pairs $W^-Z$, $W^-\gamma$, $W^+W^-$, $ZZ$ productions in the $e^- \gamma$ collisions, where the photon beam is realized by the laser back-scattering method. These processes are important tests for the non-abelian gauge sector of the standard model (SM). Precise calculations of these processes can therefore probe the anomalous gauge-boson interactions. Besides, these processes are important potential backgrounds for the intermediate mass Higgs (IMH) search in the $e\gamma\rightarrow WH\nu$ production. "
"We introduce and analyze a lattice model of anyons in a periodic potential and an external magnetic field which exhibits a transition from a Mott insulator to a quantum Hall fluid. The transition is characterized by the anyon statistics, $\alpha$, which can vary between Fermions, $\alpha=0$, and Bosons, $\alpha=1$. For bosons the transition is in the universality class of the classical three-dimensional XY model. Near the Fermion limit, the transition is described by a massless $2+1$ Dirac theory coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. Analytic calculations perturbative in $\alpha$, and also a large N-expansion, show that due to gauge fluctuations, the critical properties of the transition are dependent on the anyon statistics. Comparison with previous calcualations at and near the Boson limit, strongly suggest that our lattice model exhibits a fixed line of critical points, with universal critical properties which vary continuosly and monotonically as one passes from Fermions to Bosons. Possible relevance to experiments on the transitions between plateaus in the fractional quantum Hall effect and the magnetic field-tuned superconductor-insulator transition are briefly discussed. "
"Based on the equal-time Wigner function for the Klein-Gordon field, we discuss analytically the mechanism of pair creation in a classical electromagnetic field including back-reaction. It is shown that the equations of motion for the Wigner function can be reduced to a variable-frequency oscillator. The pair-creation rate results then from a calculation analogous to barrier penetration in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The Wigner function allows one to utilize this treatment for the formulation of an effective transport theory for the back-reaction problem with a pair-creation source term including Bose enhancement. "
The exactness and universality observed in the quantum Hall effect suggests the existence of a symmetry principle underlying Laughlin's theory. We review the role played by the infinite $W_{\infty }$ and conformal algebras as dynamical symmetries of incompressible quantum fluids and show how they predict universal finite-size effects in the excitation spectrum. 
"Mirror symmetry, a phenomenon in superstring theory, has recently been used to give tentative calculations of several numbers in algebraic geometry. In this paper, the numbers of lines and conics on various hypersurfaces which satisfy certain incidence properties are calculated, and shown to agree with the numbers predicted by Greene, Morrison, and Plesser using mirror symmetry in every instance. This increases the number of verified predictions from 3 to 65. Calculations are performed using the Maple package {\sc schubert} written by Katz and Str{\o}mme. "
"We use the Bethe ansatz equations to calculate the charge stiffness $D_{\rm c} = (L/2) d^2 E_0/d\Phi_{\rm c}^2|_{\Phi_{\rm c}=0}$ of the one-dimensional repulsive-interaction Hubbard model for electron densities close to the Mott insulating value of one electron per site ($n=1$), where $E_0$ is the ground state energy, $L$ is the circumference of the system (assumed to have periodic boundary conditions), and $(\hbar c/e)\Phi_{\rm c}$ is the magnetic flux enclosed. We obtain an exact result for the asymptotic form of $D_{\rm c}(L)$ as $L\to \infty$ at $n=1$, which defines and yields an analytic expression for the correlation length $\xi$ in the Mott insulating phase of the model as a function of the on-site repulsion $U$. In the vicinity of the zero temperature critical point U=0, $n=1$, we show that the charge stiffness has the hyperscaling form $D_{\rm c}(n,L,U)=Y_+(\xi \delta, \xi/L)$, where $\delta =|1-n|$ and $Y_+$ is a universal scaling function which we calculate. The physical significance of $\xi$ in the metallic phase of the model is that it defines the characteristic size of the charge-carrying solitons, or {\em holons}. We construct an explicit mapping for arbitrary $U$ and $\xi \delta \ll 1$ of the holons onto weakly interacting spinless fermions, and use this mapping to obtain an asymptotically exact expression for the low temperature thermopower near the metal-insulator transition, which is a generalization to arbitrary $U$ of a result previously obtained using a weak- coupling approximation, and implies hole-like transport for $0<1-n\ll\xi^{-1}$. "
A lattice approach is developed to measure the sphaleron free energy. Its feasibility is demonstrated through a Monte Carlo study of the two-dimensional O(3) sigma model. 
Several misprints in the earlier version (hep-ph/9301286) have been corrected. 
The effective lagrangian approach is reviewed and applied to the case of electroweak interactions. 
"A rotating charged black string solution in the low energy effective field theory describing five dimensional heterotic string theory is constructed. The solution is labelled by mass, electric charge, axion charge and angular momentum per unit length. The extremal limit of this solution is also studied. "
"Leptonic flavor-changing $H^0$ decays with branching ratios of the order of $10^{-5}-10^{-6}$ may constitute an interesting framework when looking for large $CP$-violating effects. We show that leptonic $CP$~asymmetries of an intermediate $H^0$ boson can be fairly large in natural scenarios of the minimal Standard Model ($SM$) with right-handed neutrinos, at a level that may be probed at future $H^0$~factories. "
"We consider theoretically the electron--electron interaction induced exchange-correlation effects in the lowest subband of a quasi-one-dimensional GaAs quantum wire structures. We calculate, within the leading order dynamical screening approximation ({\em i.e.} the so-called $GW$ approximation of the electron gas theory), the electron self-energy, spectral function, momentum distribution function, inelastic scattering rate, band gap renormalization, and, the many-body renormalization factor both at zero and finite temperatures, and, both with and without impurity scattering effects. We also calculate the effects of finite temperatures and finite impurity scattering on the many-body properties. We propose the possibility of a hot-electron transistor device with a large negative differential resistance which is based on the sudden onset of plasmon emission by energetic ballistic electrons in one dimension. The issue of the existence or non-existence of the Fermi surface among the interacting one-dimensional quantum wire electrons is critically discussed based on our numerical results. "
"An arbitrary dimensional expression is given for the anomalous dimension of the fermion field in a model with a four point interaction and a $U(1)$ gauge field, at $O(1/N^2)$ within a large flavour expansion in the Landau gauge. "
"We analyze possible lepton-flavor-violating decays of the $Z^0$ particle in a minimal extension of the Standard Model, in which one right-handed neutral field for each family has been introduced. Such rare leptonic decays are induced by Majorana neutrinos at the first electroweak loop level and are generally not suppressed by the ordinary ""see-saw"" mechanism. In particular, we find that experimental bounds on branching ratios of the order of $10^{-5}-10^{-6}$ attainable at $LEP$ may impose constraints on lepton-flavor-mixing parameters and the masses of the heavy Majorana neutrinos. "
"The formula existing in the literature for the ADM mass of 2D dilaton gravity is incomplete. For example, in the case of an infalling matter shockwave this formula fails to give a time-independent mass, unless a very special coordinate system is chosen. We carefully carry out the canonical formulation of 2D dilaton gravity theories (classical, CGHS and RST). As in 4D general relativity one must add a boundary term to the bulk Hamiltonian to obtain a well-defined variational problem. This boundary term coincides with the numerical value of the Hamiltonian and gives the correct mass which obviously is time-independent. "
"By means of techniques from the Morita equivalence theory, we get finitely generated and projective modules over the quantum Heisenberg manifolds. This enables us to get some information about the range of the trace of these algebras, at the level of the K_{0}-group, in terms of the Poisson bracket in whose direction the manifolds are deformed. "
"We show that if a rearrangement invariant Banach function space $E$ on the positive semi-axis satisfies a non-trivial lower $q-$ estimate with constant $1$ then the corresponding space $E(\nm)$ of $\tau-$measurable operators, affiliated with an arbitrary semi-finite von Neumann algebra $\nm$ equipped with a distinguished faithful, normal, semi-finite trace $\tau $, has the uniform Kadec-Klee property for the topology of local convergence in measure. In particular, the Lorentz function spaces $L_{q,p}$ and the Lorentz-Schatten classes ${\cal C}_{q,p}$ have the UKK property for convergence locally in measure and for the weak-operator topology, respectively. As a partial converse , we show that if $E$ has the UKK property with respect to local convergence in measure then $E$ must satisfy some non-trivial lower $q$-estimate. We also prove a uniform Kadec-Klee result for local convergence in any Banach lattice satisfying a lower $q$-estimate. "
"We present results for the confinement-deconfinement interface tension $\sigma_{cd}$ of quenched QCD. They were obtained by applying Binder's histogram method to lattices of size $L^2\times L_z\times L_t$ for $L_t=2$ and $L=8,10,12\mbox{ and }14$ and various $L_z\in [L,\, 4\, L]$. The use of a multicanonical algorithm and rectangular geometries have turned out to be crucial for the numerical studies. We also give an estimate for $\sigma_{cd}$ at $L_t=4$ using published data. "
"We show that if E is a Frechet G\rtimes S(M)-module, for which the canonical map from the projective completion G\rtimes S(M) {\widehat \otimes} E to E is surjective, then every element of E can be written as a finite sum of elements of the form ae where e\in E and a is an element of the smooth crossed product G\rtimes S(M). We require that the Schwartz functions S(M) vanish rapidly with repsect to a continuous, proper map \s : M ---> [0, \infty). "
We analyse the fermion masses and mixings in the flipped SU(5) model. The fermion mass matrices are evolved from the GUT scale down to $m_W$ by solving the renormalization group equations for the Yukawa couplings. The constraints imposed by the charged fermion data are then utilised to make predictions about the neutrino properties . It is found that the {\it generalized } see-saw mechanism which occurs naturally in this model can provide {\it i})a solution to the solar neutrino problem via the MSW mechanism and {\it ii})a sufficiently large $\nu _{\tau }$ mass to contribute as a hot dark matter component as indicated by the recent COBE data. 
"Recently, DiFrancesco and Zuber have characterized the RCFTs which have a description in terms of a fusion potential in one variable, and proposed a generalized potential to describe other theories. In this note we give a simple criterion to determine when such a generalized description is possible. We also determine which RCFTs can be described by a fusion potential in more than one variable, finding that in fact all RCFTs can be described in such a way, as conjectured by Gepner. "
"Let G and H be two locally compact groups acting on a C*-algebra A by commuting actions. We construct an action on the crossed product AXG out of a unitary 2-cocycle u and the action of H on A. For A commutative, and free and proper actions of G and H, we show that if the roles of these two actions are reversed, and u is replaced by u*, then the corresponding generalized fixed-point algebras, in the sense of Rieffel, are strong-Morita equivalent. We apply this result to the computation of the K-theory of quantum Heisenberg manifolds. "
"It is known that the Lagrangian for the edge states of a Chern-Simons theory describes a coadjoint orbit of a Kac-Moody (KM) group with its associated Kirillov symplectic form and group representation. It can also be obtained from a chiral sector of a nonchiral field theory. We study the edge states of the abelian $BF$ system in four dimensions (4d) and show the following results in almost exact analogy: 1) The Lagrangian for these states is associated with a certain 2d generalization of the KM group. It describes a coadjoint orbit of this group as a Kirillov symplectic manifold and also the corresponding group representation. 2) It can be obtained from with a ``self-dual"" or ``anti-self-dual"" sector of a Lagrangian describing a massless scalar and a Maxwell field [ the phrase ``self-dual"" here being used essentially in its sense in monopole theory]. There are similar results for the nonabelian $BF$ system as well. These shared features of edge states in 3d and 4d suggest that the edge Lagrangians for $BF$ systems are certain natural generalizations of field theory Lagrangians related to KM groups. "
"The growth and ordering of a Pb layer deposited on Cu(001) at 150 K has been studied using atom beam scattering. At low coverage, ordered Pb islands with a large square unit cell and nearly hexagonal internal structure are formed. This is a high order commensurate phase with 30 atoms in the unit cell. From the measurement of the island diffraction peak profiles we find a power law for the mean island - size versus coverage with an exponent $n=0.54 \pm 0.03$. A scaling behavior of growth is confirmed and a simple model describing island growth is presented. Due to the high degeneracy of the monolayer phase, different islands do not diffract coherently. Therefore, when islands merge they still diffract as separate islands and coalescence effects are thus negligible. From the result for $n$ we conclude that the island density is approximately a constant in the coverage range $0.1 < \Theta < 0.5$ where the ordered islands are observed. We thus conclude that most islands nucleate at $\Theta < 0.1$ and then grow in an approximately self similar fashion as $\Theta$ increases. "
"We point out that the abelian projection theory of quark confinement is in conflict with certain large-N predictions. According to both large-N and lattice strong-coupling arguments, the perimeter law behavior of adjoint Wilson loops at large scales is due to charge-screening, and is suppressed relative to the area term by a factor of $1/N^2$. In the abelian projection theory, however, the perimeter law is due to the fact that $N-1$ out of $N^2-1$ adjoint quark degrees of freedom are (abelian) neutral and unconfined; the suppression factor relative to the area law is thus only $1/N$. We study numerically the behavior of Wilson loops and Polyakov lines with insertions of (abelian) charge projection operators, in maximal abelian gauge. It appears from our data that the forces between abelian charged, and abelian neutral adjoint quarks are not significantly different. We also show via the lattice strong-coupling expansion that, at least at strong couplings, QCD flux tubes attract one another, whereas vortices in type II superconductors repel. "
"We show that the Hopf link invariants for an appropriate set of finite dimensional representations of $ U_q SL(2)$ are identical, up to overall normalisation, to the modular S matrix of Kac and Wakimoto for rational $k$ $\widehat {sl(2)}$ representations. We use this observation to construct new modular Hopf algebras, for any root of unity $q=e^{-i\pi m/r}$, obtained by taking appropriate quotients of $U_q SL(2)$, that give rise to 3-manifold invariants according to the approach of Reshetikin and Turaev. The phase factor correcting for the `framing anomaly' in these invariants is equal to $ e^{- {{i \pi} \over 4} ({ {3k} \over {k+2}})}$, an analytic continuation of the anomaly at integer $k$. As expected, the Verlinde formula gives fusion rule multiplicities in agreement with the modular Hopf algebras. This leads to a proposal, for $(k+2)=r/m$ rational with an odd denominator, for a set of $\widehat {sl(2)}$ representations obtained by dropping some of the highest weight representations in the Kac-Wakimoto set and replacing them with lowest weight representations. For this set of representations the Verlinde formula gives non-negative integer fusion rule multiplicities. We discuss the consistency of the truncation to highest and lowest weight representations in conformal field theory. "
"We demonstrate that the cross sections derived from the ""shadow model"" for reactions between light nuclei disagree with low-energy laboratory data and exhibit unphysical behavior at energies below those for which data exist. As a consequence, the large thermonuclear reaction rates obtained by Scalia and Figuera [Phys. Rev. C46, 2610 (1992)] are wrong. "
"In quantum models of gravity, it is surmized that configurations with degenerate coframes could occur during topology change of the underlying spacetime structure. However, the coframe is not the true Yang--Mills type gauge field of the translations, since it lacks the inhomogeneous gradient term in the gauge transformations. By explicitly restoring this ``hidden"" piece within the framework of the affine gauge approach to gravity, one can avoid the metric or coframe degeneracy which would otherwise interfere with the integrations within the path integral. This is an important advantage for quantization. "
Following our earlier work we argue in detail for the equivalence of the nonlinear $\sigma$ model with Hopf term at~$\theta=\pi/2s$ ~and an interacting spin-s theory. We give an ansatz for spin-s operators in the $\sigma$ model and show the equivalence of the correlation functions.We also show the relation between topological and Noether currents. We obtain the Lorentz and discrete transformation properties of the spin-s operator from the fields of the $\sigma$ model. We also explore the connection of this model with Quantum Hall Fluids. 
"We classify the automorphisms of the (chiral) level-k affine SU(3) fusion rules, for any value of k, by looking for all permutations that commute with the modular matrices S and T. This can be done by using the arithmetic of the cyclotomic extensions where the problem is naturally posed. When k is divisible by 3, the automorphism group (Z_2) is generated by the charge conjugation C. If k is not divisible by 3, the automorphism group (Z_2 x Z_2) is generated by C and the Altsch\""uler--Lacki--Zaugg automorphism. Although the combinatorial analysis can become more involved, the techniques used here for SU(3) can be applied to other algebras. "
"BFV--BRST charge for q-deformed algebras is not unique. Different constructions of it in the classical as well as in the quantum phase space for the $q$-deformed algebra sl_q(2) are discussed. Moreover, deformation of the phase space without deforming the generators of sl(2) is considered. $\hbar$-q-deformation of the phase space is shown to yield the Witten's second deformation. To study the BFV--BRST cohomology problem when both the quantum phase space and the group are deformed, a two parameter deformation of sl(2) is proposed, and its BFV-BRST charge is given. "
"Anomalies can be anticipated at the classical level without changing the classical cohomology, by introducing extra degrees of freedom. In the process, the anomaly does not quite disappear. We show that, in fact, it is shifted to new symmetries that come with the extra fields. "
"We propose a mechanism which naturally contains the relation $\mu_{B} = 3\mu_{S}$ of the hadronic gas produced in heavy-ion collisions at CERN. Our starting assumption is the existence of a sharp front separating the quark-gluon plasma phase from the hadronic phase. Energy-momentum conservation across the front leads to the following consequences for an adiabatic process a) The baryon chemical potential, $\mu_{B}$, is approximately continuous across the front. b) The temperature in the hadronic gas is higher than the phase transition temperature due to superheating. c) In the region covered by the experiments the velocity of the hadronic gas approximately equals the speed of sound in the hadronic gas. "
"By considering corrections to the asymptotic scaling functions of the photon and electron in quantum electrodynamics with $\Nf$ flavours, we solve the skeleton Dyson equations at $O(1/\Nf)$ in the large $\Nf$ expansion at the $d$-dimensional critical point of the theory and deduce the critical exponent $\beta^\prime(g_c)$, in arbitrary dimensions, and subsequently present a method for computing higher order corrections to $\beta(g)$. "
"For a complex surface of general type with a relatively minimal genus 2 fibration, the bounds of the orders of the automorphism group of the fibration, of its abelian subgroups and of its cyclic subgroups are determined as linear functions of $c^2_1$. Most of them are the best. "
"The possibility of detecting proto-galaxies in the UV band is pointed out, assuming that galaxy formation occured at z $\sim 5-6$. It is shown that the diffuse gas in collapsing galaxy sized objects with temperatures $\sim 10^{6\pm0.5}$ K, and with a modest amount of metallicity, should copiously produce emission lines from highly ionized Iron atoms. The expected luminosity from models of galaxy formation is compared with the sensitivity of HST. "
"I show that the electric dipole moment of the W-boson vanishes to two loop order in the Standard KM model. As a consequence, the electric dipole moment of the electron vanishes to three loop order. Including QCD corrections may give a non-vanishing result; I estimate d_W \approx 8 10^-31 ecm which induces an electron EDM \approx 8 10^-41 ecm, considerably smaller found in a previous calculation. "
"Guided by history, we review the major developments concerning realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials since the pioneering work by Kuo and Brown on the effective nuclear interaction. Our main emphasis is on the physics underlying various models for the NN interaction developed over the past quarter-century. We comment briefly on how to test the quantitative nature of nuclear potentials properly. A correct calculation (performed by independent researchers) of the $\chi^2$/datum for the fit of the world NN data yields 5.1, 3.7, and 1.9 for the Nijmegen, Paris, and Bonn potential, respectively. Finally, we also discuss in detail the relevance of the on- and off-shell properties of NN potentials for microscopic nuclear structure calculations. "
"We apply the coadjoint orbit technique to the group of area preserving diffeomorphisms (APD) of a 2D manifold, particularly to the APD of the semi-infinite cylinder which is identified with $w_{\infty}$. The geometrical action obtained is relevant to both $w$ gravity and 2D turbulence. For the latter we describe the hamiltonian, which appears to be given by the Schwinger mass term, and discuss some possible developments within our approach. Next we show that the set of highest weight orbits of $w_{\infty}$ splits into subsets, each of which consists of highest weight orbits of $\bar{w}_N$ for a given N. We specify the general APD geometric action to an orbit of $\bar{w}_N$ and describe an appropriate set of observables, thus getting an action and observables for $\bar{w}_N$ gravity. We compute also the Ricci form on the $\bar{w}_N$ orbits, what gives us the critical central charge of the $\bar{w}_N$ string, which appears to be the same as the one of the $W_N$ string. "
"In this work we extend Onofri and Perelomov's coherent states methods to the recently introduced $OSp(1/2)$ coherent states. These latter are shown to be parametrized by points of a supersymplectic supermanifold, namely the homogeneous superspace $OSp(1/2)/U(1)$, which is clearly identified with a supercoadjoint orbit of $OSp(1/2)$ by exhibiting the corresponding equivariant supermoment map. Moreover, this supermanifold is shown to be a nontrivial example of Rothstein's supersymplectic supermanifolds. More precisely, we show that its supersymplectic structure is completely determined in terms of $SU(1,1)$-invariant (but unrelated) K\""ahler $2$-form and K\""ahler metric on the unit disc. This result allows us to define the notions of a superK\""ahler supermanifold and a superK\""ahler superpotential, the geometric structure of the former being encoded into the latter. "
"We consider the physical properties of four dimensional black hole solutions to the effective action describing the low energy dynamics of the gravitational sector of heterotic superstring theory. We compare the properties of the external field strengths in the perturbative solution to the full $O(\alpha')$ string effective action equations, to those of exact solutions in a truncated action for charged black holes, and to the Kerr-Newman family of solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory. We contrast the numerical results obtained in these approaches, and discuss limitations of the analyses. Finally we discuss how the new features of classical string gravity affect the standard tests of general relativity. "
The mechanism underlying any bosonisation or fermionisation is exposed.It is shown that any local theory of fermions on a lattice in any spatial dimension greater than one is equivalent to a local theory of Ising spins coupled to a $Z_{2}$ gauge field.There is a close relation to the description of anyons using a Chern-Simons term. 
We display a new integrable perturbation for both N=1 and N=2 superconformal minimal models. These perturbations break supersymmetry explicitly. Their existence was expected on the basis of the classification of integrable perturbations of conformal field theories in terms of distinct classical KdV type hierarchies sharing a common second Hamiltonian structure. 
I review the current status of lattice QCD results. I concentrate on new analytical developments and on numerical results relevant to phenomenology. 
We present a singularity free class of inhomogeneous cylindrical universes filled with stiff perfect fluid $(\rho = p)$. Its matter free $ (\rho = 0)$ limit yield two distinct vacuum spacetimes which can be considered as analogues of Kasner solution for inhomogeneous singularity free spacetime. 
"The collective charge-excitation spectrum of a double quantum well system in a strong magnetic field is obtained within the random phase approximation. Correction to the spectrum coming from the finiteness of the magnetic field is calculated up to the first order in inverse of the magnetic field. Dependencies on the magnetic field of (i) the velocity of long wave length excitation and (ii) the phase boundary of the quantum Hall state signaled by the softening of the roton minimum of the spectrum are discussed. Keywords: quantum Hall effect, two dimensional electrons, strong magnetic field, double quantum well, excitonic state "
"The specific heat and susceptibility data for $^3$He on Grafoil are analyzed in the framework of the Landau Fermi liquid theory. The dominant interaction between $^3$He quasiparticles is found to be in the p-wave channel for most experimentally accessible areal densities of $^{3}$He. This interaction is attractive and gives rise to the p-wave transition temperature which for moderate areal densities is estimated to be on the scale of several millikelvin. The relevance of these results to the anomaly in the specific heat observed at $ T_k = 3.2 \, \mbox{mK} $ is discussed. "
"In this paper we consider a class of the 2D integrable models. These models are higher spin XXZ chains with an extra condition of the commensurability between spin and anisotropy. The mathematics underlying this commensurability is provided by the quantum groups with deformation parameter being an Nth root of unity. Our discussion covers a range of topics including new integrable deformations, thermodynamics, conformal behaviour, S-matrices and magnetization. The emerging picture strongly depends on the N-parity. For the N even case at the commensurable point, S-matrices factorize into N=2 supersymmetric Sine-Gordon matrix and an RSOS piece. The physics of the N odd case is rather different. Here, the supersymmetry does not manifest itself and the bootstrap hypothesis fails. Away from the commensurable point, we find an unusual behaviour. The magnetization of our chains depends on the sign of the external magnetic field. "
"We examine the problem of defining Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics for a particle moving on a quantum plane $Q_{q,p}$. For Lagrangian mechanics, we first define a tangent quantum plane $TQ_{q,p}$ spanned by noncommuting particle coordinates and velocities. Using techniques similar to those of Wess and Zumino, we construct two different differential calculi on $TQ_{q,p}$. These two differential calculi can in principle give rise to two different particle dynamics, starting from a single Lagrangian. For Hamiltonian mechanics, we define a phase space $T^*Q_{q,p}$ spanned by noncommuting particle coordinates and momenta. The commutation relations for the momenta can be determined only after knowing their functional dependence on coordinates and velocities. Thus these commutation relations, as well as the differential calculus on $T^*Q_{q,p}$, depend on the initial choice of Lagrangian. We obtain the deformed Hamilton's equations of motion and the deformed Poisson brackets, and their definitions also depend on our initial choice of Lagrangian. We illustrate these ideas for two sample Lagrangians. The first system we examine corresponds to that of a nonrelativistic particle in a scalar potential. The other Lagrangian we consider is first order in time derivatives "
"Chiral perturbation theory in heavy-fermion formalism is developed for meson-exchange currents in nuclei and applied to nuclear axial- charge transitions. Calculation is performed to the next-to-leading order in chiral expansion which involves graphs up to one loop. The result turns out to be very simple. The previously conjectured notion of ""chiral filter mechanism"" in the time component of the nuclear axial current and the space component of the nuclear electromagnetic current is verified to that order. As a consequence, the phenomenologically observed soft-pion dominance in the nuclear process is given a simple interpretation in terms of chiral symmetry in nuclei. In this paper, we focus on the axial current, relegating the EM current which can be treated in a similar way to a separate paper. We discuss the implication of our result on the enhanced axial-charge transitions observed in heavy nuclei and clarify the relationship between the phenomenological meson-exchange description and the chiral Lagrangian description. "
"A simple model is used to explore issues related to self-similarity, intermittency and scaling behavior in nuclear collisions. Both scaled factorial moments and power moments are considered in the investigation of these features. The product mass yields are used to construct probability distributions and generalized Renyi entropies. The scaling properties of the resulting Renyi entropies are studied. Both exponential and power law behavior are found. A discussion of dimensions associated with these scaling properties is also given. An analysis of some experimental data is presented. "
"Features in the zero sound attenuation near the pair-breaking edge in superfluid $^3$He-B have been observed in large magnetic fields. Schopohl and Tewordt [{\sl J. Low Temp. Phys.} {\bf 57}, 601 (1984)] claim that the $J=1^-, M=\pm 1$ order-parameter collective modes couple to zero sound as a result of the distortion of the equilibrium order parameter by a magnetic field; they identify the new features with these modes. However, we show that, when the effect of gap distortion on the collective modes is properly taken into account, the collective mode equations of Schopohl and Tewordt yield no direct coupling of zero sound to the $J=1^-$ modes. Thus, the identification of the absorption features reported by Ling, Saunders and Dobbs [{\sl Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 59}, 461 (1987)] near the pair-breaking edge with the $J=1^-$ modes is not clearly established. "
"An inventory is made of the experiments which can measure the transversely polarized quark distributions and fragmentation functions at leading twist. (Contribution to the 10th International Symposium on High Energy Spin Physics, Nagoya, Japan, Nov. 9-14, 1992) "
"The Type II Superstring amplitude to 1-loop order is given by an integral of $\vartheta$-functions over the moduli space of tori, which diverges for real momenta. We construct the analytic continuation which renders this amplitude well defined and finite, and we find the expected poles and cuts in the complex momentum plane. "
A new vector field is introduced into 2-form Einstein gravity in four dimensions to restore a large symmetry of its topological version. Two different expressions for the BRST charge are given in the system: one of them associated with a set of irreducible symmetries and the other with a set of on-shell reducible symmetries. 
"Let $X$ be a normal variety over the field of complex numbers with log terminal singularities and the canonical divisor $K_X$ being ${\bf Q}$-Gorenstein. Assume that $L$ is an ample line bundle over $X$ and $\phi: X\to Y$ is a morphism supported by $K_X+rL$ for some positive rational number $r$. In the present paper we study the evaluation $\phi^*\phi_*(L)\to L$ and the locus of points where it is not surjective which we call relative base point locus of $L$. In particular, we prove that, if the dimension of a fiber of $\phi$ is small with respect to $r$ then the relative base point locus does not meet the fiber. Consequently, in this case, we discuss the structure of the map $\phi$ for a smooth $X$. "
"Various features of the mass yields in heavy ion collisions are studied. The mass yields are discussed in terms of iterative one dimensional discrete maps. These maps are shown to produce orbits for a monomer or for a nucleus which generate the mass yields and the distribution of cluster sizes. Simple Malthusian dynamics and non-linear Verhulst dynamics are used to illustrate the approach. Nuclear cobwebbing, attractors of the dynamics, and Lyapanov exponents are discussed for the mass distribution. The self-similar property of the Malthusian orbit offers a new variable for the study of scale invariance using power moments of the mass distribution. Correlation lengths, exponents and dimensions associated with scaling relations are developed. Fourier transforms of the mass distribution are used to obtain power spectra which are investigated for a $1/f^{\beta}$ behavior. "
"(Review) Properties of neutral and charged anyon fluids are examined, with the main focus on the question whether or not a charged anyon fluid exhibits a superconductivity at zero and finite temperature. Quantum mechanics of anyon fluids is precisely described by Chern-Simons gauge theory. The random phase approximation (RPA), the linearized self-consistent field method (SCF), and the hydrodynamic approach employed in the early analysis of anyon fluids are all equivalent. Relations and differences between neutral and charged anyon fluids are discussed. It is necessary to go beyond RPA and the linearized SCF, and possively beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation, to correctly describe various phenomena such as the flux quantization, vortex formation, and phase transition. Topics includes: Anyons, Aharonov-Bohm effect, Chern-Simons gauge theory, Hartree-Fock ground state, RPA and SCF, Path integral representation, RPA = linearized SCF, Response functions, Phonons and plasmons, Hydrodynamic description, Effective theory, Meissner effect at zero and finite temperature, de Haas - van Alphen effect in SCF, Thermodynamic potential in inhomogeneous fields, T_c, Other important issues.

"We consider a model for the electroweak interactions with $SU(3)_L\otimes U(1)_N$ gauge symmetry. We show that, it is the conservation of $F=L+B$ which forbids massive neutrinos and the neutrinoless double beta decay, $(\beta\beta)_{0\nu}$. Explicit and spontaneous breaking of $F$ imply that the neutrinos have an arbitrary mass and $(\beta\beta)_{0\nu}$ proceeds also with some contributions that do not depend explicitly on the neutrino mass. "
"We discuss the infinite dimensional algebras appearing in integrable perturbations of conformally invariant theories, with special emphasis in the structure of the consequent non-abelian infinite dimensional algebra generalizing $W_\infty$ to the case of a non abelian group. We prove that the pure left-symmetry as well as the pure right-sector of the thus obtained algebra coincides with the conformally invariant case. The mixed sector is more involved, although the general structure seems to be near to be unraveled. We also find some subalgebras that correspond to Kac-Moody algebras. The constraints imposed by the algebras are very strong, and in the case of the massive deformation of a non-abelian fermionic model, the symmetry alone is enough to fix the 2- and 3-point functions of the theory. "
"In theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking, the loop expansion of the effective potential is awkward. In such theories, the exact effective potential $V(\phi_c,T)$ is real and convex (as a function of the classical field $\phi_c$), but its perturbative series can be complex with a real part that is concave. These flaws limit the utility of the effective potential, particularly in studies of the early universe. A generalization of the effective potential is available that is real, that has no obvious convexity problems, and that can be computed in perturbation theory. For the theory with classical potential $V(\phi) = (\lambda/4)(\phi^2 - \sigma^2)^2$, this more-effective potential closely tracks the usual effective potential where the latter is real $|\phi_c| \geq \sigma/\sqrt{3}$ and naturally extends it to $\phi_c = 0$, revealing that the critical temperature at the one-loop level runs from $T_C \approx 1.81 \sigma$ for $\lambda = 0.1$ to $T_C \approx 1.74 \sigma$ for $\lambda = 1$. "
"The gravitational field of monopoles, cosmic strings and domain walls is studied in the quadratic gravitational theory $R+\alpha R^2$ with $\alpha |R|\ll 1$, and is compared with the result in Einstein's theory. The metric aquires modifications which correspond to a short range `Newtonian' potential for gauge cosmic strings, gauge monopoles and domain walls and to a long range one for global monopoles and global cosmic strings. In this theory the corrections turn out to be attractive for all the defects. We explain, however, that the sign of these corrections in general depends on the particular higher order derivative theory and topological defect under consideration. The possible relevance of our results to the study of the evolution of topological defects in the early universe is pointed out. "
"Recent experiments by Baxter et al. showed the existence of density waves in granular material flowing out of a hopper. We show, using Molecular Dynamics Simulations, that this effect is a consequence of static friction and find that these density fluctuations follow a $1/f$ spectrum. The effect is enhanced when the opening angle of the hopper decreases. "
We have investigated the standard one-loop quantum corrections for a particularly simple non-commutative geometry model containing fermions interacting with a unique abelian gauge field and a unique scalar through Yukawa couplings. In this model there are certain relations among the different coupling constants quite similar to the ones appearing in the Connes-Lott version of the standard model. We find that it is not possible to implement those relations in a renormalization-group invariant way. 
A basic problem in quantizing a field in curved space is the decomposition of the classical modes in positive and negative frequency. The decomposition is equivalent to a choice of a complex structure in the space of classical solutions. In our construction the real tunneling geometries provide the link between the this complex structure and analytic properties of the classical solutions in a Riemannian section of space. This is related to the Osterwalder- Schrader approach to Euclidean field theory. 
"A Banach space $\X$ has the complete continuity property (CCP) if each bounded linear operator from $L_1$ into $\X$ is completely continuous (i.e., maps weakly convergent sequences to norm convergent sequences). The main theorem shows that a Banach space failing the CCP (resp., failing the CCP and failing cotype) has a subspace with a finite dimensional decomposition (resp., basis) which fails the CCP. "
"We have explored the electroweak phase transition in minimal supergravity models by extending previous analysis of the one-loop Higgs potential to include finite temperature effects. Minimal supergravity is characterized by two higgs doublets at the electroweak scale, gauge coupling unification, and universal soft-SUSY breaking at the unification scale. We have searched for the allowed parameter space that avoids washout of baryon number via unsuppressed anomalous Electroweak sphaleron processes after the phase transition. This requirement imposes strong constraints on the Higgs sector. With respect to weak scale baryogenesis, we find that the generic MSSM is {\it not} phenomenologically acceptable, and show that the additional experimental and consistency constraints of minimal supergravity restricts the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs even further to $m_h\lsim 32\GeV$ (at one loop), also in conflict with experiment. Thus, if supergravity is to allow for baryogenesis via any other mechanism above the weak scale, it {\it must} also provide for B-L production (or some other `accidentally' conserved quantity) above the electroweak scale. Finally, we suggest that the no-scale flipped $SU(5)$ supergravity model can naturally and economically provide a source of B-L violation and realistically account for the observed ratio $n_B/n_\gamma\sim 10^{-10}$. "
"We study two-dimensional dilaton gravity coupled to massless scalar fields for static solutions. In addition to the well known black hole, we find another class of solutions that may be understood as that of the black hole in equilibrium with a radiation bath. We claim that there is a solution that is qualitatively unchanged after including Hawking radiation and back-reaction and is furthermore geodesically complete. We compute the thermodynamics of these spacetimes and their mass. We end with a brief discussion of the linear response about these solutions, its significance to stability and noise and a speculation regarding the endpoint of Hawking evaporation in four dimensions. (plain TeX; one figure, available upon request.) "
"We obtain an improved upper bound on the lightest neutral CP-even Higgs boson mass from a low energy renormalisation-group analysis of the Higgs sector of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model. We find $m_h< 145$ GeV for $m_t=90$ GeV, decreasing to $m_h< 123$ GeV for $m_t=180$ GeV. We also discuss the light Higgs spectrum in the region of parameter space close to the upper bound. "
The main motivation for B factories is the investigation of CP violation. We consider two questions: 1) Why has there been essentially no experimental progress in CP violation in the 28 years since its discovery in 1964? 2) Why do we expect better results from B factories? 
"Recent progress toward classifying low-dimensional chaos measured from time series data is described. This classification theory assigns a template to the time series once the time series is embedded in three dimensions. The template describes the primary folding and stretching mechanisms of phase space responsible for the chaotic motion. Topological invariants of the unstable periodic orbits in the closure of the strange set are calculated from the (reconstructed) template. These topological invariants must be consistent with any model put forth to describe the time series data, and are useful in invalidating (or gaining confidence in) any model intended to describe the dynamical system generating the time series. "
"Recent attempts to detect the pion polarizability via analysis of $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow\pi\pi$ measurements are examined. The connection between calculations based on dispersion relations and on chiral perturbation theory is established by matching the low energy chiral amplitude with that given by a full dispersive treatment. Using the values for the polarizability required by chiral symmetry, predicted and experimental cross sections are shown to be in agreement. "
"Extending our previous work on 2D growth for the Laplace equation we study here {\it multidimensional} growth for {\it arbitrary elliptic} equations, describing inhomogeneous and anisotropic pattern formations processes. We find that these nonlinear processes are governed by an infinite number of conservation laws. Moreover, in many cases {\it all dynamics of the interface can be reduced to the linear time--dependence of only one ``moment"" $M_0$} which corresponds to the changing volume while {\it all higher moments, $M_l$, are constant in time. These moments have a purely geometrical nature}, and thus carry information about the moving shape. These conserved quantities (eqs.~(7) and (8) of this article) are interpreted as coefficients of the multipole expansion of the Newtonian potential created by the mass uniformly occupying the domain enclosing the moving interface. Thus the question of how to recover the moving shape using these conserved quantities is reduced to the classical inverse potential problem of reconstructing the shape of a body from its exterior gravitational potential. Our results also suggest the possibility of controlling a moving interface by appropriate varying the location and strength of sources and sinks. "
"By quantizing the generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction scheme for arbitrary $sl_2$ embeddings we show that a large set $\cal W$ of quantum W algebras can be viewed as (BRST) cohomologies of affine Lie algebras. The set $\cal W$ contains many known $W$ algebras such as $W_N$ and $W_3^{(2)}$. Our formalism yields a completely algorithmic method for calculating the W algebra generators and their operator product expansions, replacing the cumbersome construction of W algebras as commutants of screening operators. By generalizing and quantizing the Miura transformation we show that any $W$ algebra in $\cal W$ can be embedded into the universal enveloping algebra of a semisimple affine Lie algebra which is, up to shifts in level, isomorphic to a subalgebra of the original affine algebra. Therefore {\em any} realization of this semisimple affine Lie algebra leads to a realization of the $W$ algebra. In particular, one obtains in this way a general and explicit method for constructing the free field realizations and Fock resolutions for all algebras in $\cal W$. Some examples are explicitly worked out. "
"We consider vector induced lattice gauge theories, in particular we consider the QED induced and we show that at negative temperature corresponds to the dimer problem while at positive temperature it describes a gas of branched polymers with loops. We argue that these models are critical at $D_{cr}=6$ for $N\ne\infty$ and they are {\sl not} critical for $N=\infty$. "
"It has been shown in the past that in a shell model calculation, restricted to 1Hbar*Omega 1p-1h configurations, the energy splitting between the lowest J=0-, T=0 and J=0-, T=1 states in 16O is mainly due to the tensor component of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. In this work, we extend the calculation to include 3Hbar*Omega 2p-2h and 3p-3h configurations. We use realistic G matrices derived from various One-Boson-Exchange potentials taking into account the effects of the Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach, i.e., a modification of the Dirac spinors for the nucleons in the medium. It is found that the splitting is rather sensitive to the long-range components of the isovector tensor force. The splitting is reduced considerably by including 2p-2h configurations, in particular. "
"We discuss in some detail the requirements on an early-Universe model that solves the horizon and flatness problems during the epoch of classical cosmology ($t\ge t_i\gg 10^{-43}\sec$). We show that a dynamical resolution of the horizon problem requires superluminal expansion (or very close to it) and that a truly satisfactory resolution of the flatness problem requires entropy production. This implies that a proposed class of adiabatic models in which the Planck mass varies by many orders of magnitude cannot fully resolve the flatness problem. Furthermore, we show that, subject to minimal assumptions, such models cannot solve the horizon problem either. Because superluminal expansion and entropy production are the two generic features of inflationary models, our results suggest that inflation, or something very similar, may be the only dynamical solution to the horizon and flatness problems. "
"Let F be a quasi-linear map on a separable normed space X, and assume that F splits on an infinite-dimensional subspace of X. Then the twisted sum topology induced by F on the direct sum of X and the real line can be written as the supremum of a nearly convex topology and a trivial dual topology. (This partially answers a question of Klee.) The result applies when X is \ell_1 and F is the Ribe function or when X is James's space. "
"In this note I show that a pi-1-2 singleton R of L-degree strictly between 0 and 0# can be obtained so as to be the unique solution to a pi-1-2 formula which provably has at most one solution, in the theory ZFC+(*) where (*) has the approximate strength of an ineffable cardinal. "
"We compute the effect of small-size instanton corrections to current-current correlators, for all combinations of axial, vector, and possibly flavour non-diagonal currents. We apply our result to the hadronic decays of the $\tau$ lepton, in order to assess the reliability of the determination of $\as$ from the $\tau$ hadronic width. "
"We study a class of classical dilaton vacua in string theory that depend on the light-cone variable $z=t\pm x$ and, thus, have wavelike behavior. One of the interesting results is the existence of a solution subclass with perfectly regular space-time geometry, where the string coupling constant can be made arbitrarily small. "
We use the new symmetries in the heavy quark limit to calculate the exclusive B-decays $B \rightarrow K^i \psi $ where $K^i$ are higher resonances of K-meson. We then estimate the long distance contributions to $B \rightarrow K^i \gamma $ decays via $\psi - \gamma$ conversion. The results point to around $30 \%$ uncertainty in the top quark mass determined by measurements of rare B-decays $B \rightarrow K^i \gamma$. 
We describe a $q$-deformed dynamical system corresponding to the quantum free particle moving along the circle. The algebra of observables is constructed and discussed. We construct and classify irreducible representations of the system. 
"We review mechanisms for the transport of angular momentum in accretion disks that are low mass, in the sense that the gravitational forces produced by the material in these disks has a negligible effect on disk dynamics. There is no established consensus on how this transport takes place. We note that for phenomenological reasons the traditional $\alpha$ model is probably not a good description of real disks. We discuss models in which angular momentum transport is driven by shocks, and by magnetic field instabilities. The latter is more promising, but requires a dynamo. We note that the direction of angular momentum transport due to convection in a conducting disk is not known as competing mechanisms are at work. We briefly discuss a number of possible dynamo mechanisms, and their problems. We then give a detailed exposition of the internal wave driven dynamo model, in which internal waves excited at large radii drive an $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo. "
Internal target experiments with high quality proton beams allow for a new class of experiments providing null tests of time reversal symmetry in forward scattering. This could yield more stringent limits on T-odd P-even observables. A excellent candidate for such experiments is the proton deuteron system. This system is analyzed in terms of effective T-violating P-conserving nucleon-nucleon interactions and bounds on coupling strengths that might be expected are given. 
"We discuss why the SU(3)^3 supersymmetric model with the most general superpotential can naturally break to the standard model if gauge singlets and a discrete symmetry are included. This mechanism does away with the need for fine-tuning in the form of the assumed absence of certain terms in the superpotential. It also automatically guarantees that any abelian discrete phase symmetry of the GUT will survive the symmetry breaking. Such a discrete symmetry, also known as the matter parity, is needed to suppress both proton decay and the flavor changing neutral current (FCNC), and may help solve the hierarchy problem. "
Covariant anomalies are studied in terms of the theory of secondary characteristic classes of the universal bundle of Yang-Mills theory. A new set of descent equations is derived which contains the covariant current anomaly and the covariant Schwinger term. The counterterms relating consistent and covariant anomalies are determined. A geometrical realization of the BRS/anti-BRS algebra is presented which is used to understand the relationship between covariant anomalies in different approaches. 
"Lecture notes from the Jerusalem Winter School on Theoretical Physics ""Correlated Electron Systems"", Dec. 1991 -- Jan. 1992. Contains a review of recent and not so recent results in the theory of correlated fermions in one dimension. "
"We show that in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model one--loop effects at finite temperature may lead to a spontaneous breaking of CP invariance in the scalar sector. Requiring that the breaking takes place at the critical temperature for the electroweak phase transition, we find that the parameters space is compatible with a mass of the Higgs pseudoscalar in agreement with the present experimental lower bounds. Possible implications for baryogenesis are discussed. "
"The submitted paper regards the example of the Conformal Field Theory on a 2d manifold which metric has a point-like singularity.Since this manifold is not conformally equivalent to that with the flat space-time metric,it's naturally to expect that the theory cannot be trivially reduced to the well-known consideration of the CFT on a plane,and some modifications are needed.Particularly,this paper shows how the vacuum of the theory on a singular surface differs from the vacuum of the BPZ theory.Namely,this vacuum would not be SL(2,C)-invariant and the expressions for the correlation functions should be modified. As a consequence of that,some ""effective mass"" is brought to the theory. "
"Cosmological constraints on grand unified theories with spontaneous lepton number violation are analysed. We concentrate on $SO(10)$, the simplest of the models possessing this property. It has been noted previously that the consistency of these models with the observed baryon asymmetry generically implies strict upper bounds on the light neutrino masses. In this paper, we analyze the situation in detail. We find that minimal models of fermion masses face difficulties, but that it is possible for these models to generate an adequate baryon asymmetry via non-equilibrium lepton number violating processes when the right-handed neutrino masses are near their maximum possible values. This condition uniquely picks out the minimal gauge symmetry breaking scheme. A non-minimal model is also analyzed, with somewhat different conclusions due to the nature of the imposed symmetries. "
We propose an improved iterative scheme for calculating higher genus contributions to the multi-loop (or multi-point) correlators and the partition function of the hermitian one matrix model. We present explicit results up to genus two. We develop a version which gives directly the result in the double scaling limit and present explicit results up to genus four. Using the latter version we prove that the hermitian and the complex matrix model are equivalent in the double scaling limit and that in this limit they are both equivalent to the Kontsevich model. We discuss how our results away from the double scaling limit are related to the structure of moduli space. 
"In this paper we investigate in more detail our previous formulation of the dilaton-gravity theory by Bilal--Callan--de~Alwis as a $SL_2$-conformal affine Toda (CAT) theory. Our main results are: i) a field redefinition of the CAT-basis in terms of which it is possible to get the black hole solutions already known in the literature; ii) an investigation the scattering matrix problem for the quantum black hole states. It turns out that there is a range of values of the $N$ free-falling shock matter fields forming the black hole solution, in which the end-point state of the black hole evaporation is a zero temperature regular remnant geometry. It seems that the quantum evolution to this final state is non-unitary, in agreement with Hawking's scenario for the black hole evaporation. "
"We compute the leading contribution to the E2/M1 mixing ratio of the decay $\Delta\rightarrow N\gamma$ in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. We find the mixing ratio to be $4\% \ltap |\delta_{\rm E2/M1}| \ltap 11\%$, much larger than estimates based on the quark model and other hadronic models. We also compute the mixing ratio for the radiative decay of the hyperon resonances. The decays $\Sigma^{*+}\rightarrow\Sigma^+\gamma$ and $\Xi^{*-}\rightarrow\Xi^-\gamma$ provide a particularly sensitive probe of deviations from heavy baryon spin-flavour SU(6). "
Talk presented at NAS Special Colloquium on Physical Cosmology 
"It is known that the existing experimental limit for$ CPT $ violation is rather poor; the 10 \% level at best. The $ \DSDQ $ rule is tested only up to 2 \%. In this note, we discuss the possibility of measuring $ T, CP, CPT $ and $ \DSDQ $ rule violations in the neutral $ K $ meson system. It is shown that not all the symmetry breaking parameters can be determined at a symmetric $ \phi $ factory. Experiments with $ K^0 $ and $ \bar{K}^0 $ beams are needed to test all the symmetries. "
"Wheeler-DeWitt equation is applied to $k > 0$ Friedmann Robertson Walker metric with various types of matter. It is shown that if the Universe ends in the matter dominated era (e.g., radiation or pressureless gas) with zero cosmological constant, then the resulting Wheeler-DeWitt equation describes a bound state problem. As solutions of a non-degenerate bound state system, the eigen-wave functions are real (Hartle-Hawking) and the usual issue associated with the ambiguity in the boundary conditions for the wave functions is resolved. Furthermore, as a bound state problem, there exists a quantization condition that relates the curvature of the three space with the energy density of the Universe. Incorporating a cosmological constant in the early Universe (inflation) is given as a natural explanation for the large quantum number associated with our Universe, which resulted from the quantization condition. It is also shown that if there is a cosmological constant $\Lambda > 0$ in our Universe that persists for all time, then the resulting Wheeler-DeWitt equation describes a non-bound state system, regardless of the magnitude of the cosmological constant. As a consequence, the wave functions are in general complex (Vilenkin) and the initial conditions for wave functions are a free parameters not determined by the formalism. "
The analytic calculation of the three-loop QCD $\beta$-function and anomalous dimensions within the minimal subtraction scheme in an arbitrary covariant guage is presented. The result for the $\beta$-function coincides with the previous calculation \cite{tvz}. 
Recent work on generating the excess of matter over antimatter in the early universe during the electroweak phase transition is reviewed. 
"Ambartzumian et.al. suggested that the modified Steiner action functional had desirable properties for a random surface action. However, Durhuus and Jonsson pointed out that such an action led to an ill-defined grand-canonical partition function and suggested that the addition of an area term might improve matters. In this paper we investigate this and other related actions numerically for dynamically triangulated random surfaces and compare the results with the gaussian plus extrinsic curvature actions that have been used previously. "
"We present a quantum geometric framework for stochastic quantisation in the case of a free Klein-Gordon field on Euclidean space. In this approach the noise is part of the background space, spacetime is fuzzy. We extend the notion of sharp point limit and show how fuzzy spacetime and the Klein-Gordon field gives the Euclidean space and the stochastically quantised Klein-Gordon field respectively. "
"We analyse the dynamics of the collision of two spherical massive shells in a generally spherically symmetric background, obtaining an expression from the conservation law that imposes a constraint between the different parameters involved. We study the light-like limit and make some comparisons of the predictions of our master equation with the results obtained in the case of collision of light-like shells, like the short life of white holes or the mass inflation phenomena. We present some particular cases of the constraint equation. "
"We present a unified approach which is accurate at all temperatures and densities for calculating the energy loss from a stellar plasma due to the plasma process, the decay of photons and plasmons into neutrino pairs. To allow efficient numerical calculations, an analytic approximation to the dispersion equations for photons and plasmons is developed. It is correct to order $\alpha$ in the classical, degenerate, and relativistic limits for all momenta $k$ and is correct at small $k$ for all temperatures and electron densities. Within the same approximations, concise expressions are derived for the transverse, longitudinal, and axial vector components of the neutrino emissivity. "
"The main result of this paper is that every non-reflexive subspace $Y$ of $L_1[0,1]$ fails the fixed point property for closed, bounded, convex subsets $C$ of $Y$ and nonexpansive (or contractive) mappings on $C$. Combined with a theorem of Maurey we get that for subspaces $Y$ of $L_1[0,1]$, $Y$ is reflexive if and only if $Y$ has the fixed point property. For general Banach spaces the question as to whether reflexivity implies the fixed point property and the converse question are both still open. "
"We propose a new wiew on the structure of quantum mechanics and postulate a q-deformed algebra of observables. We find equations of motion for this system, which guarantee a unitary time developement. We solve this equations for simple models. We write this formalism in terms of twisted deRham complex. "
"Let K be a convex body in $R^d$. A random polytope is the convex hull $[x_1,...,x_n]$ of finitely many points chosen at random in K. $\Bbb E(K,n)$ is the expectation of the volume of a random polytope of n randomly chosen points. I. B\'ar\'any showed that we have for convex bodies with $C^3$ boundary and everywhere positive curvature $$ c(d)\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac {vol_d(K)-\Bbb E(K,n)}{(\frac{vol_d(K)}{n})^{\frac{2}{d+1}}} =\int_{\partial K} \kappa(x)^{\frac{1}{d+1}}d\mu(x) $$ where $\kappa(x)$ denotes the Gau\ss-Kronecker curvature. We show that the same formula holds for all convex bodies if $\kappa(x)$ denotes the generalized Gau\ss-Kronecker curvature. "
"We will prove an abstract comparision principle which translates gaussian cotype in Rademacher cotype conditions and vice versa. More precisely, let $2\!<\!q\!<\!\infty$ and $T:\,C(K)\,\to\,F$ a linear, continous operator. T is of gaussian cotype q if and only if ( \summ_1^n (\frac{|| Tx_k||_F}{\sqrt{\log(k+1)}})^q )^{1/q} \, \le c || \summ_1^n \varepsilon_k x_k ||_{L_2(C(K))} , for all sequences with $(|| Tx_k ||)_1^n$ decreasing. T is of Rademacher cotype q if and only if (\summ_1^n (|| Tx_k||_F \,\sqrt{\log(k+1)})^q )^{1/q} \, \le c || \summ_1^n g_k x_k ||_{L_2(C(K))} , for all sequences with $(||Tx_k ||)_1^n$ decreasing. Our methods allows a restriction to a fixed number of vectors and complements the corresponding results of Talagrand. "
"We propose a new mechanism for baryogenesis in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model, that does not depend on (super)GUT interactions. It occurs by the non-perturbative electroweak reprocessing of a lepton asymmetry. This lepton asymmetry is generated by the effects of lepton number violating induced operators, arising from ""see-saw"" (s)neutrino masses, which act on scalar condensate oscillations along flat directions of the supersymmetric standard model. "
"We build the constraint that all electrons are in the lowest Landau level into the Chern-Simons field theory approach for the fractional quantum Hall system. We show that the constraint can be transmitted from one hierarchical state to the next. As a result, we derive in generic the equations of the fractionally charged vortices ( quasi-particles ) for arbitrary hierarchy filling. For a finite system, we show that the action for each hierarchical state can be divided into two parts: the surface part provides the action for the edge excitations while the remaining bulk part is exactly the action for the next hierarchical states. In particular, we not only show that the surface action for the edge excitations would be decoupled from the bulk at each hierarchy filling, but also derive the explicit expressions analytically for the drift velocities of the hierarchical edge excitations. "
The electromagnetic contribution to the $K^+ - K^0$ mass difference is calculated in the $1/N_c$ approach including the $SU(3)$ breaking contributions due to a non-zero strange quark mass. The short-distance contribution can be unambiguously determined in terms of the known parameters of the next-to-leading order chiral lagrangian. The long distance part is estimated using the $1/N_c$ approach by Bardeen et al. Relatively large corrections are found. 
"Non-perturbative electroweak effects, in thermal equilibrium in the early universe, have the potential to erase the baryon asymmetry of the universe, unless it is encoded in a B-L asymmetry, or in some ""accidentally"" conserved quantity. We first consider the possibility that the BAU may be regenerated from lepton flavour asymmetries even when initially $B-L = 0$. We show that provided some, but {\it not} all the lepton flavours are violated by ${\Delta}L{\neq}0$ interactions in equilibrium, the BAU may be regenerated without lepton mass effects. We next examine the possibility of encoding the baryon asymmetry in a primordial asymmetry for the right-handed electron, which due to its weak Yukawa interaction only comes into chemical equilibrium as the sphalerons are falling out of equilibrium. This would also raise the possibility of preserving an initial baryon asymmetry when $B-L = 0$. "
"We evaluate the constraints that the COBE observations put on baryogenesis in inflationary cosmologies.We consider the supersymmetric version of the proposal of Fukugita and Yanagida, that the baryon asymmetry of the universe is created by nonperturbative electroweak reprocessing of a lepton asymmetry generated in the decay of heavy right-handed see-saw (s)neutrinos. We review our recent proposal of a mechanism for baryogenesis via sphaleron reprocessing of a lepton asymmetry generated by (s)neutrino mass effects on flat direction scalar condensate oscillations. Finally we analyze in detail the implementation of these mechanisms in the recently proposed ansatze for fermion mass matrices in supersymmetric, unified, theories. "
"We calculate the $O(p^6)$ corrections to the anomalous form factors appearing in $\pi^+$, $K^+ \to e^+ \nu \gamma,\ \mu^+\nu\gamma$ and $K_{l4}$ decays in Chiral Perturbation Theory. The relevant dimension $6$ terms of the lagrangian are evaluated assuming their saturation by the vector meson contribution. "
"This is a 30 page set of lecture notes, in Plain TeX, which were prepared for and presented as a series of lectures (10 1/2 hours over two weeks) at the 2nd Summer School on Banach Spaces, Related Areas and Applications in Prague and Paseky, Czech Republic, during August, 1993. They consist of a largely self-contained exposition of both classical and recent basic facts about maximal monotone operators on Banach spaces, motivated in part by the goal of highlighting several fundamental properties of such operators which remain open questions in nonreflexive Banach spaces. "
We introduce a novel technique to find the asymptotic time behaviour of deterministic systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion. The procedure is tested for various classes of simple but physically relevant 1-D maps and possible relevance of our findings for more complicated problems is briefly discussed. 
"We have evaluated the one loop correction to the bound on the lightest Higgs mass valid in the minimal, $ E_{6}$ based, supersymmetric $ \eta$ model. Under the assumption that the theory remains perturbative up to the $10^{16}$ GeV scale, we derive a conservative bound that decreases with the top mass for $M_t \leq 2 M_W$ and varies from $ \sim 160$ GeV to $\sim 145$ GeV when $90 \leq M_t \leq 200$ GeV. "
"We will show that for $q<p$ there exists an $\al < \infty$ such that \[ \pi_{pq}(T) \pl \le c_{pq} \pi_{pq}^{[n^{\alpha}]}(T) \mbox{for all $T$ of rank $n$.}\] Such a polynomial number is only possible if $q=2$ or $q<p$. Furthermore, the growth rate is linear if $q=2$ or $\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p}>\frac{1}{2}$. Unless $\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p}=\frac{1}{2}$ this is also a necessary condition . "
"Classical vortex solutions in various two-Higgs systems are studied. The systems we consider include the standard model with two Higgs doublets, in which case the vortex appears as part of a string-like object. The Higgs potentials contain several different couplings in general and the spontaneous symmetry breaking involves with two different vacuum expectation values. In particular it is shown that the existence of such a solution in general requires a specific ratio of the two Higgs vacuum expectation values, i.e. $\tan\beta$, and some inequalities between different Higgs couplings. This ratio can be determined in terms of the couplings in the Higgs potential. The Higgs masses are also computed in this case. (1+2)-d solutions are topological so that they are topologically stable and the Bogomol'nyi bound is saturated for some couplings. Some comments on the stabilization of (1+3)-d solutions are also given. Thus, as long as such a defect can be formed in the early universe, stable or not, $\tan\beta$ is no longer an independent free parameter in the theory. "
"We present an approach to steady-state mesoscopic transport based on the maximum entropy principle formulation of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Our approach is not limited to the linear response regime. We show that this approach yields the quantization observed in the integer quantum Hall effect at large currents, which until now has been unexplained. We also predict new behaviors of non-local resistances at large currents in the presence of dirty contacts. "
"We compare the expected contribution of FR-II hot spots to the ultra-high energy cosmic ray spectrum (Rachen & Biermann 1993, A&A in press, BB paper astro-ph/9301010) to improved experimental results. We introduce a ""world data set"" of UHE cosmic rays by comparing the data of various experiments, extracting relative systematic errors in the energy derivation and averaging over energy bins. Since the contribution of FR-II hot spots is expected to be dominated by protons, we can also compare it to the recent experimental results for the proton component of cosmic rays between 0.1 and 1 EeV from both the Fly's Eye and the Akeno airshower detector (Gaisser et al. 1993, Phys Rev D in press, and Stanev et al. 1992, A&A submitted). The result is striking: Our prediction for energies below 1 EeV fits very well to the data for the proton component, while explaining the total flux at highest energies as well. The result is consistent with the expectation of a galactic component, consisting of heavy nuclei only, that has a slope of about -3.1 and cuts off at 5 EeV, as predicted by Biermann 1993 (A&A in press, BB paper astro-ph/9301008) "
"Considering shock-accelerated protons in addition to electrons in a synchrotron radio jet naturally produces the observed X- through gamma ray continuum emission of flat-spectrum radio-loud AGN, whereas the corresponding shock-accelerated electrons produce the infrared through optical continuum. All of these emission components are rapidly variable on short time scales which can be accounted for by a common origin of the blazar emission in a relativistic sub-parsec scale jet. Moreover, neutrino fluxes are estimated which may be observable with the HiRes experiment and the impact on the ISM of the host galaxy of neutrons escaping from the nuclear jet is investigated. "
"We summarize a study of an Abelian gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions, the gauge field being coupled to nonrelativistic Fermions. The Action for the gauge field is a combination of the Maxwell term and a Chern-Simons (CS) term. We study the limit of vanishing Fermions' charge, keeping fixed the gauge field mass induced by the CS term. By considering a closed surface, in particular a torus to keep translational invariance, we show that the Fermions do not decouple completely from the gauge field, and in fact they behave as Anyons treated in the -translationally invariant formulation of the- Mean Field approximation. We describe the exact solution of this limiting case. "
A calculation of the hard bremsstrahlung process e+ e- -> mu+ mu- gamma gamma is presented and compared with recent results from the L3 Collaboration. 
"We present a short overview on the extragalactic background radiation from radio to X-rays, with an eye to the relation to galaxy formation and emphasizing on astrophysical backgrounds (as opposed to cosmological). As the radio background, the wealth of data on source counts make possible reliable estimations of the contribution from extragalactic sources. At 178 MHz we obtain an antenna temperature of about 22 K, with the 60% of the flux contributed by radiogalaxies and quasars and the remaining part from sub-mJy radio sources. At high frequencies the compact sources, generally QSOs, dominate. An intense far-IR/sub-mm background is predicted if a large fraction of the hard X-ray Background (XRB) comes from starburst galaxies but this might face problems with the upper limits on the far-IR isotropic flux. To clarify the problem spectral measurements should be complemented with the analysis of small scale anisotropies. The flattening of the QSO counts at B=19.5 suggests that their contribution to the optical/near-IR background is small in comparison to that of galaxies. As for the XRB, a consisting picture obtains considering two AGN populations: a ""soft X-ray spectrum"" population and a ""hard X-ray spectrum"" one, mainly contributing to the soft and to the hard XRB respectively. A third population of extremely absorbed or of reflection dominated AGN could either be the dominant contributor of the XRB above 3 keV. "

"The radiative corrections to the $3\times3$scalar and the $2\times2$ pseudoscalar neutral Higgs boson massmatrices are calculated in the supersymmetric extension of the standard model including a gauge singlet superfield in the effective potential approach. The full $t$ and $b$ quark/squark contributions including the nonlogarithmic terms are taken into account, which are seen to affect the result significantly. An analytic formula for the upper bound on the mass of the lightest neutral Higgs scalar including these corrections is given. (Figure available upon request) "
"A coordinate-free approach to limits of spacetimes is developed. The limits of the Schwarzschild metric as the mass parameter tends to 0 or $\infty$ are studied, extending previous results. Besides the known Petrov type D and 0 limits, three vacuum plane-wave solutions of Petrov type N are found to be limits of the Schwarzschild spacetime. "
"We propose a simple mechanism for solving the $\mu$ problem in the context of minimal low--energy supergravity models. This is based on the appearance of non--renormalizable couplings in the superpotential. In particular, if $H_1H_2$ is an allowed operator by all the symmetries of the theory, it is natural to promote the usual renormalizable superpotential $W_o$ to $W_o+\lambda W_o H_1H_2$, yielding an effective $\mu$ parameter whose size is directly related to the gravitino mass once supersymmetry is broken (this result is maintained if $H_1H_2$ couples with different strengths to the various terms present in $W_o$). On the other hand, the $\mu$ term must be absent from $W_o$, otherwise the natural scale for $\mu$ would be $M_P$. Remarkably enough, this is entirely justified in the supergravity theories coming from superstrings, where mass terms for light fields are forbidden in the superpotential. We also analyse the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ breaking, finding that it takes place satisfactorily. Finally, we give a realistic example in which supersymmetry is broken by gaugino condensation, where the mechanism proposed for solving the $\mu$ problem can be gracefully implemented. "
We describe a general method of calculating the fully differential cross section for the production of jets at next-to-leading order in a hadron collider. This method is based on a `crossing' of next-to-leading order calculations with all partons in the final state. The method introduces universal crossing functions that allow a modular approach to next-to-leading order calculations for any process with initial state partons. These techniques are applied to the production of jets in association with a vector boson including all decay correlations of the final state observables. 
"{}From the non-equilibrium critical relaxation study of the two-dimensional Ising model, the dynamical critical exponent $z$ is estimated to be $2.165 \pm 0.010$ for this model. The relaxation in the ordered phase of this model is consistent with $\exp (-\sqrt{t/\tau })$ behavior. The interface energy of the three-dimensional Ising model is studied and the critical exponent of the correlation length $\nu$ and the critical amplitude of the surface tension $\sigma_0$ are estimated to be $0.6250\pm 0.025$ and $1.42\pm 0.04$, respectively. A dynamic Monte Carlo renormalization group method is applied to the equilibrium properties of the three-dimensional Ising model successfully. "
"The parity violating longitudinal asymmetry ${\cal A}$ is calculated for quasielastic electron scattering. We use a variety of relativistic mean field models for the response of nuclear matter and $^{12}$C at a momentum transfer of q=550 MeV/c. Relativistic effects from a reduced nucleon mass, RPA correlations and vacuum polarization can all change ${\cal A}$ by a relatively large amount. These large nuclear structure corrections could make it impossible to extract strange quark matrix elements or radiative corrections to weak axial currents. "
"A solvable 2-dimensional conformally invariant midi-superspace model for black holes is obtained by imposing spherical symmetry in 4-dimensional conformally invariant Einstein gravity. The Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the theory is solved exactly to obtain the unique quantum wave functional for an isolated black hole with fixed mass. By suitably relaxing the boundary conditions, a non-perturbative ansatz is obtained for the wave functional of a black hole interacting with its surroundings. "
The method of the calculation of effective potential (in linear curvature approximation and at any loop) in massless gauge theory in curved space- time by the direct solution of RG equation is given.The closed expression for two-loop effective potential is obtained.Two-loop effective potential in scalar self-interacting theory is written explicitly.Some comments about it as well as about two-loop effective potential in standard model are presented. 
"If the electroweak symmetry-breaking sector becomes strongly interacting at high energies, it can be probed through longitudinal $W$ scattering. We present a model with many inelastic channels in the $W_L W_L$ scattering process, corresponding to the production of heavy fermion pairs. These heavy fermions affect the elastic scattering of $W_L$'s by propagating in loops, greatly reducing the amplitudes in some charge channels. We conclude that the symmetry-breaking sector cannot be fully explored by using, for example, the $W_L^\pm W_L^\pm$ mode alone, even when no resonance is present; all $W_L W_L \to W_L W_L$ scattering modes must be measured. "
"This paper analyzes spacetime symmetries of topological string theory on a two dimensional torus, and points out that the spacetime geometry of the model is that of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. Previously I found an infinite symmetry algebra in the absolute BRST cohomology of the model. Here I find an analog of the BV $\Delta$ operator, and show that it defines a natural semirelative BRST cohomology. In the absolute cohomology, the ghost-number-zero symmetries form the algebra of all infinitesimal spacetime diffeomorphisms, extended at non-zero ghost numbers to the algebra of all odd-symplectic diffeomorphisms on a spacetime supermanifold. In the semirelative cohomology, the symmetries are reduced to $w_\infty$ at ghost number zero, and to a topologically twisted N=2 $w_\infty$ superalgebra when all ghost numbers are included. I discuss deformations of the model that break parts of the spacetime symmetries while preserving the topological BRST symmetry on the worldsheet. In the absolute cohomology of the deformed model, another topological $w_\infty$ superalgebra may emerge, while the semirelative cohomology leads to a bosonic $w_\infty$ symmetry. "
"In LEP searches for the neutral CP-odd scalar $A^0$ of a multi-Higgs doublet model, experimenters have searched for $Z\rightarrow h^0 A^0$ (where $h^0$ is the lightest CP-even scalar). No model-independent limit on the $A^0$ mass can be deduced from present data if $m_{h^0}>m_Z$. In this paper, we compute the rates for $Z\rightarrow A^0 A^0\nu\bar\nu$ and $e^+e^-\rightarrow A^0 A^0 Z$. Assuming that no light CP-even neutral scalars exist, the branching ratio for $Z\rightarrow A^0 A^0\nu\bar\nu$ is found to be less than $1.4\times10^{-8}$. At higher $e^+e^-$ center-of-mass energies, $\sigma(e^+e^-\rightarrow A^0 A^0 Z)$ peaks at $0.5$~fb. A comparison with other direct searches for the $A^0$ is briefly considered. "
"We investigate a model with an extra $Z_{2}$ gauge symmetry in the Standard Model. We assume that only the scalars and the leptons carry non-zero charge. The symmetry gives a structure to the mass matrix for the neutrinos. With two extra Higgs singlets and two extra singlet right-handed neutrinos we can build a model that fits the requirements of the MSW-solution of the Solar neutrino problem. With a third singlet right-handed neutrino it is also possible to have a 10 eV neutrino, a dark matter candidate. "
"We used exact diagonalization of small clusters and exact results in various limits to determine the phase diagram and the critical exponents of the one dimensional (1D) $U-V$ model at quarter-filling. We found an instability of the Luttinger liquid to a charge-density wave (CDW) insulator across a boundary going from ($U$,$V$) =($+\infty$,$2t$) to ($4t$,$+\infty$). In the metallic phase, the dominant fluctuations are superconducting if $V$ is large enough and spin-density wave (SDW) otherwise. In the latter case, the critical exponent $\alpha$ of the momentum distribution does not exceed 9/16. The relevance of these results to 1D organic conductors is discussed. "
"We study the black hole information paradox in the context of a two-dimensional toy model given by dilaton gravity coupled to $N$ massless scalar fields. After making the model well-defined by imposing reflecting boundary conditions at a critical value of the dilaton field, we quantize the theory and derive the quantum quantum $S$-matrix for the case that $N$=$24$. This $S$-matrix is unitary by construction, and we further argue that in the semiclassical regime it describes the formation and subsequent Hawking evaporation of two-dimensional black holes. Finally, we note an interesting correspondence between the dilaton gravity $S$-matrix and that of the $c=1$ matrix model. "
"We use exact diagonalisation in order to study the infinite - $U$ limit of the two dimensional Hubbard model. As well as looking at single-particle correlations, such as $n_{{\bf k}\sigma }=\langle c^\dagger _{{\bf k}\sigma }c_{{\bf k}\sigma } \rangle $, we also study {\it N-particle correlation functions} which compare the relative positions of {\it all} the particles in different models. In particular we study 16 and 18-site clusters and compare the charge correlations in the Hubbard model with those of spinless fermions and hard-core bosons. We find that although low densities of holes favour a `locally-ferromagnetic' fermionic description, the correlations at larger densities resemble those of pure hard-core bosons surprisingly well . "
A direct relationship between the (non-quantum) group SU(2) and the Kauffman bracket in the framework of Chern-Simons theory is explicitly shown. 
"We discuss several applications and extensions of our previous operator solution of the $N$-body Calogero problem, \ie N particles in 1 dimension subject to a two-body interaction of the form $\half \sum_{i,j}[ (x_i - x_j)^2 + g/ {(x_i - x_j)^2}]$. Using a complex representation of the deformed Heisenberg algebra underlying the Calogero model, we explicitly establish the equivalence between this system and anyons in the lowest Landau level. A construction based on supersymmetry is used to extend our operator method to include fermions, and we obtain an explicit solution of the supersymmetric Calogero model constructed by Freedman and Mende. We also show how the dynamical $OSp(2;2)$ supersymmetry is realized by bilinears of modified creation and annihilation operators, and how to construct a supersymmetic extension of the deformed Heisenberg algebra. "
"The correlation between a random sequence and its transformed sequences is studied. In the case of a permutation operation or, in other word, the shuffling operation, it is shown that the correlation can be so small that the sequences can be regarded as independent random sequences. The applications to the Monte Carlo simulations are also given. This method is especially useful in the Ising Monte Carlo simulation. "
"We study nonequilibrium steady states in the Lorentz gas of periodic scatterers when an external field is applied and the particle kinetic energy is held fixed by a ``thermostat'' constructed according to Gauss' principle of least constraint (a model problem previously studied numerically by Moran and Hoover). The resulting dynamics is reversible and deterministic, but does not preserve Liouville measure. For a sufficiently small field, we prove the following results: (1) existence of a unique stationary, ergodic measure obtained by forward evolution of initial absolutely continuous distributions, for which the Pesin entropy formula and Young's expression for the fractal dimension are valid; (2) exact identity of the steady-state thermodyamic entropy production, the asymptotic decay of the Gibbs entropy for the time-evolved distribution, and minus the sum of the Lyapunov exponents; (3) an explicit expression for the full nonlinear current response (Kawasaki formula); and (4) validity of linear response theory and Ohm's transport law, including the Einstein relation between conductivity and diffusion matrices. Results (2) and (4) yield also a direct relation between Lyapunov exponents and zero-field transport (=diffusion) coefficients. Although we restrict ourselves here to dimension $d=2,$ the results carry over to higher dimensions and to some other physical situations: e.g. with additional external magnetic fields. The proofs use a well-developed theory of small perturbations of hyperbolic dynamical systems and the method of Markov sieves, an approximation of Markov partitions. In our context we discuss also the van Kampen objection to linear response theory, which, we point out, overlooks the ``structural stability'' of strongly hyperbolic flows. "
"We present a new class of quantum two dimensional dilaton gravity model, which is described by $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model deformed by $(1,1)$-operator. We analyze the model by ${1 \over k}$ expansion ($k$ is the level of $SL(2,R)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model) and we find that the curvature singularity does not appear when $k$ is large and the Bondi mass is bounded from below. Furthermore, the rate of the Hawking radiation in the quantum black hole created by shock wave goes to zero asymptotically and the radiation stops when the Bondi mass vanishes. "
"Measurement of the helicity asymmetric cross section for semi-inclusive production of $\Lambda$-hyperons in $e^+e^-$ annihilation near the $Z^0$ resonance allows a complete determination of the spin-dependent fragmentation functions for the different quark flavors into the $\Lambda$. The parity violating, self analyzing, decay of the final state $\Lambda$ makes the experimental analysis of the helicity asymmetry possible. This experiment should be practical with present day technology at the LEP collider at CERN or at SLC at SLAC. "
"We study CP violation in fermion pair decays of Higgs boson. We idenfy some CP odd observables related to the tree level decay amplitude. We find that a few thousand Higgs boson decay events can already provide important information about CP violation. If the Higgs boson is produced, such an analysis could be carried out at the SSC, LHC and NLC. "
"We develop a renormalization-group formalism for non-renormalizable theories and apply it to Einstein gravity theory coupled to a scalar field with the Lagrangian $L=\sqrt{g} [R U(\phi)-{1/2} G(\phi) g^{\mu\nu} \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial_{\nu}\phi- V(\phi)]$, where $U(\phi), G(\phi)$ and $V(\phi)$ are arbitrary functions of the scalar field. We calculate the one-loop counterterms of this theory and obtain a system of renormalization-group equations in partial derivatives for the functions $U, G$ and $V$ playing the role of generalized charges which substitute for the usual charges in multicharge theories. In the limit of a large but slowly varying scalar field and small spacetime curvature this system gives the asymptotic behaviour of the generalized charges compatible with the conventional choice of these functions in quantum cosmological applications. It also demonstrates in the over-Planckian domain the existence of the Weyl-invariant phase of gravity theory asymptotically free in gravitational and cosmological constants. "
"We show that the present LEPI lower bound on the Standard Model Higgs boson mass ($M_H\gsim60\GeV$) applies as well to the lightest Higgs boson ($h$) of the minimal $SU(5)$ and no-scale flipped $SU(5)$ supergravity models. This result would persist even for the ultimate LEPI lower bound ($M_H\gsim70\GeV$). We show that this situation is a consequence of a decoupling phenomenon in the Higgs sector driven by radiative electroweak breaking for increasingly larger sparticle masses, and thus it should be common to a large class of supergravity models. A consequence of $m_h\gsim60\GeV$ in the minimal $SU(5)$ supergravity model is the exclusion from the allowed parameter space of `spoiler modes' ($\chi^0_2\to\chi^0_1 h$) which would make the otherwise very promising trilepton signal in $p\bar p\to\chi^\pm_1\chi^0_2X$ unobservable at Fermilab. Within this model we also obtain stronger upper bounds on the lighter neutralino and chargino masses, \ie, $m_{\chi^0_1}\lsim50\GeV$, $m_{\chi^0_2,\chi^\pm_1}\lsim100\GeV$. This should encourage experimental searches with existing facilities. "
"We show that, for some semiconductor devices and physical experiments, processes which scatter electrons {\em into} a state $|{\bf k}\rangle$ can contribute strongly to the decay of a nonequilibrium electron occupation of $|{\bf k}\rangle$. For electrons, the decay rate $\gamma({\bf k})$ is given by the sum of the total scattering-out {\em and scattering-in} rates of state $|{\bf k}\rangle$. The scattering-in term, which is often neglected in calculations, increases $\gamma({\bf k})$ of low energy electrons injected into semidegenerate systems, which includes many doped semiconductor structures at nonzero temperatures, particularly those of reduced dimensions. "
"We present the crumpling transition in three-dimensional Euclidian space of dynamically triangulated random surfaces with edge extrinsic curvature and fixed topology of a sphere as well as simulations of a dynamically triangulated torus. We used longer runs than previous simulations and give new and more accurate estimates of critical exponents. Our data indicate a cusp singularity in the specific heat. The transition temperature, as well as the exponents are topology dependent. "
"In a gauge theory at nonzero temperature the eigenvalues of the Wilson line form a set of gauge invariant observables. By constructing the corresponding partition function for the phases of these eigenvalues, we prove that the trivial vacuum, where the phases vanish, is a minimum of the free energy. "
"Complementarity - the absence of a phase boundary separating the Higgs and confinement phases of a gauge theory - can be violated by the addition of chiral fermions. We utilize chiral symmetry violating fermion correlators such as $ \langle \bps \psi \rangle $ as order parameters to investigate this issue. Using inequalities similar to those of Vafa-Witten and Weingarten, we show that SU(2) gauge theories with Higgs and fermion fields in the fundamental representation exhibit chiral symmetry breaking in the confined phase and therefore do {\it not} lead to massless composite fermions. We discuss the implications for the Abbott-Farhi strongly interacting standard model. "
"We discuss in detail how string-inspired lineal gravity can be formulated as a gauge theory based on the centrally extended Poincar\'e group in $(1+1)$ dimensions. Matter couplings are constructed in a gauge invariant fashion, both for point particles and Fermi fields. A covariant tensor notation is developed in which gauge invariance of the formalism is manifest. "
"We compare two approaches to the description of pion Compton scattering at moderate momentum transfer, one being based on local duality QCD sum rules for the invariant amplitudes of the process, which have been derived recently, and the other on the modified factorization formula with Sudakov effects included. We find that perturbative QCD predictions are dominant over those from QCD sum rules only for the scattering angle greater than 90$^o$. "
We discuss a simplicial dimension shift which associates to each n-manifold an n-1-manifold. As a corollary we show that an invariant which was recently proposed by Ooguri and by Crane and Yetter for the construction of 4-dimensional quantum field theories out of 3-dimensional theories is trivial. 
"The physical states on the free field Fock space of the ${SL(2,R)\over SL(2,R)$ model at any level are computed. Using a similarity transformation on $Q_{BRST}$, the cohomology of the latter is mapped into a direct sum of simpler cohomologies. We show a one to one correspondence between the states of the $k=-1$ model and those of the $c=1$ string model. A full equivalence between the ${SL(2,R)\over SL(2,R)$ and ${SL(2,R)\over U(1)$ models at the level of their Fock space cohomologies is found. "
This is a revised and corrected version of a preprint circulated in 1990 in which various non-self-adjoint limit algebras are classified. The principal invariant is the scaled $K_0$ group together with the algebraic order on the scale induced by partial isometries in the algebra. 
"A simple convex lattice polytope $\Box$ defines a torus-equivariant line bundle $\LB$ over a toric variety $\XB.$ Atiyah and Bott's Lefschetz fixed-point theorem is applied to the torus action on the $d''$-complex of $\LB$ and information is obtained about the lattice points of $\Box$. In particular an explicit formula is derived, computing the number of lattice points and the volume of $\Box$ in terms of geometric data at its extreme points. We show this to be equivalent the results of Brion \cite{brion} and give an elementary convex geometric interpretation by performing Laurent expansions similar to those of Ishida \cite{ishida}. "
"A proof of critical conformal invariance of Green's functions for a quite wide class of models possessing critical scale invariance is given. A simple method for establishing critical conformal invariance of a composite operator, which has a certain critical dimension, is also presented. The method is illustrated with the example of the Gross--Neveu model and the exponents \et\ at order $1/n^3$, \Dl\ and $1/\nu$ at order $1/n^2$ are calculated with the conformal bootstrap method. "
"We study the kinetics of ordering in Cu3Au using a model Hamiltonian derived from the effective medium theory of chemical bonding. Monte Carlo simulations are used to investigate universal and non-universal features of the growth kinetics. Anisotropic scaling of the structure factor is observed in late-stage growth of ordered domains. The anisotropy is a non-universal feature determined by details of the microscopic model, and we find that the anisotropy observed in the simulations is in excellent agreement with experiments on Cu3Au. The simulations are discussed in the context of theories of unstable growth. To our knowledge, this is the first study of kinetics in a realistic model Hamiltonian describing the material-specific properties of Cu3Au. "
"The F and B matrices associated with Virasoro null vectors are derived in closed form by making use of the operator-approach suggested by the Liouville theory, where the quantum-group symmetry is explicit. It is found that the entries of the fusing and braiding matrices are not simply equal to quantum-group symbols, but involve additional coupling constants whose derivation is one aim of the present work. Our explicit formulae are new, to our knowledge, in spite of the numerous studies of this problem. The relationship between the quantum-group-invariant (of IRF type) and quantum-group-covariant (of vertex type) chiral operator-algebras is fully clarified, and connected with the transition to the shadow world for quantum-group symbols. The corresponding 3-j-symbol dressing is shown to reduce to the simpler transformation of Babelon and one of the author (J.-L. G.) in a suitable infinite limit defined by analytic continuation. The above two types of operators are found to coincide when applied to states with Liouville momenta going to $\infty$ in a suitable way. The introduction of quantum-group-covariant operators in the three dimensional picture gives a generalisation of the quantum-group version of discrete three-dimensional gravity that includes tetrahedra associated with 3-j symbols and universal R-matrix elements. Altogether the present work gives the concrete realization of Moore and Seiberg's scheme that describes the chiral operator-algebra of two-dimensional gravity and minimal models. "
"I study the time evolution of the density matrices of quantum Fermi systems interacting with classic external Fermi fields. This interaction either changes the temperature of the system or it affects the density of particles. For relativistic Dirac fermions, variations of temperature lead to creation (annihilation) of particle - antiparticle pairs. The change of the density (or of the chemical potential) indicates the existence of the incoming (outgoing) flux of fermions from (to) the bath. These changes are independent for the different modes and in order to model the thermalization one should adjust the spectrum of the noise. The linear time dependences of the densities of particles are characteristic for all the processes. "
"In this paper, we completely settle several of the open questions regarding the relationships between the three most fundamental forms of set convergence. In particular, it is shown that Wijsman and slice convergence coincide precisely when the weak star and norm topologies agree on the dual sphere. Consequently, a weakly compactly generated Banach space admits a dense set of norms for which Wijsman and slice convergence coincide if and only if it is an Asplund space. We also show that Wijsman convergence implies Mosco convergence precisely when the weak star and Mackey topologies coincide on the dual sphere. A corollary of these results is that given a fixed norm on an Asplund space, Wijsman and slice convergence coincide if and only if Wijsman convergence implies Mosco convergence. "
"The left and right handed fermion zero-modes are examined. Their behaviour under the variation of the size of the instanton, $\ri$, and the size of the Higgs core, $\rh$, for a range of Yukawa couplings corresponding to the fermion masses in the electroweak theory are studied. It is shown that the characteristic radii of the zero-modes, in particlar those the left handed fermions, are locked to the instanton size, and are not affected by the variation of $\rh$, except for fermion masses much larger than those in the standard electroweak theory. "
"We discuss two independent issues about the baryon asymmetry of the universe. First, assuming that it is generated by an unspecified source at high temperatures, we study the effects of non-perturbative $SU(2)_W$ dynamics above the electroweak scale, in the context of supersymmetric models. We find that there is a substantial difference with the nonsupersymmetric case with the net effect of relaxing previous bounds on B and L violating interactions. In particular supersymmetry allows neutrino masses as large as 10 eV (preferred by solar neutrino and COBE data and measurable at future neutrino oscillation experiments). Second, we argue that the existence of a mixed lepton number-gravitational anomaly in the standard model will induce B-L violating interactions. These transitions would be catalized by Einstein-Yang-Mills instantons or sphalerons and could create a primordial B-L asymmetry at Planck temperatures or lower. Gravity (and the anomaly structure of the standard model) could then be the ultimate source of the baryon asymmetry. We analyze the viability of the presently known gravitational instantons and sphalerons to realize this scenario. (Talk presented by FQ at the Texas/Pascos Conference, Berkeley Dec.1992.) "
"A physical interpretation is given for some Hermitian Jordan triple systems (HJTS) that were recently discussed by Gunaydin (hep-th/9301050). Quadratic Jordan algebras derived from HJTS provide a formulation of quantum mechanics that is a natural framework within which exceptional structures are identified with physically realistic structures of a quantum field theory that includes both the standard model and MacDowell-Mansouri gravity. The structures allow the calculation of the relative strengths of the four forces, including the fine structure constant ALPHA = 1/137.03608. "
"Using a program of perturbative resummation I compute the damping rates for fields at nonzero spatial momentum to leading order in weak coupling in hot $QCD$. Sum rules for spectral densities are used to simplify the calculations. For massless fields the damping rate has an apparent logarithmic divergence in the infrared limit, which is cut off by the screening of static magnetic fields (``magnetic mass''). This demonstrates how at high temperature even perturbative quantities are sensitive to nonperturbative phenomenon. "
"We study the relationships between Gateaux, weak Hadamard and Frechet differentiability and their bornologies for Lipschitz and for convex functions. In particular, Frechet and weak Hadamard differentiabily coincide for all Lipschitz functions if and only if the space is reflexive (an earlier paper of the first two authors shows that these two notions of differentiability coincide for continuous convex functions if and only if the space does not contain a copy of $\ell_1$). We also examine when Gateaux and weak Hadamard differentiability coincide for continuous convex functions. For instance, spaces with the Dunford-Pettis (Schur) property can be characterized by the coincidence of Gateaux and weak Hadamard (Frechet) differentiabilty for dual norms. "
"The problem of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation in La$_2$CuO$_4$ is revisited in connection with the recent measurements of the NQR relaxation rate for temperatures up to $ 900\mbox{K} $ [T.\ Imai {\em et al.}, Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett., in press]. We use an approach based on the exact diagonalization for the Heisenberg model to calculate the short wavelength contribution to the relaxation rate in the high temperature region, $ T \! \agt \! J/2 $. It is shown that the spin diffusion accounts for approximately 10\% of the total relaxation rate at $900 \mbox{K} $ and would become dominant for $T\! >\! J$. The calculated $1/T_1$ is in good agreement with the experiment both in terms of the absolute value and temperature dependence. "
"It has recently been observed that a stochastic (infinite degree of freedom) time series with a $1/f^\alpha$ power spectrum can exhibit a finite correlation dimension, even for arbitrarily large data sets. [A.R. Osborne and A.~Provenzale, {\sl Physica D} {\bf 35}, 357 (1989).] I will discuss the relevance of this observation to the practical estimation of dimension from a time series, and in particular I will argue that a good dimension algorithm need not be trapped by this anomalous fractal scaling. Further, I will analytically treat the case of gaussian \onefas noise, with explicit high and low frequency cutoffs, and derive the scaling of the correlation integral $C(N,r)$ in various regimes of the $(N,r)$ plane. Appears in: {\sl Phys. Lett. A} {\bf 155} (1991) 480--493. "
"We investigate the extent to which the scattering of light from plasma fluctuations can mimic a cosmological red-shift, as has been suggested by Wolf et al. A plasma model for the plasma structure function results in a spectrum of scattered light very different from that associated with a constant red-shift, implying that the ""Wolf effect"" cannot be involved to perturb the cosmological distance scale. "
This paper explores the geometric meaning of the failure of certain kinds of Wahl maps to surject on a general curve. Sufficient conditions for surjectivity are given. An approach used by Voisin to study canonical Wahl maps is applied in this direction. 
"We present a complete calculation of the effective lagrangian for $b \rightarrow s$ processes with $QCD$ corrections, in the leading logarithm approximation, for the cases $m_t=m_w$ and $m_t \gg m_w$. The effective lagrangian is then applied to estimate the $b \rightarrow s \gamma$ decay rate. We find that it is enhanced by a factor of 6 for the case $m_t=m_w$, and a factor of about 2 for $m_t \gg m_w$. Our results differ from those found in the literature, but are not very different numerically for $m_t=m_w$. "
"We discuss the structure of correlators involving the spinor emission vertex in non critical $N=1$ superstring theory. The technique used in the computation is the zero mode integration to arrive at the integral representation, and later an analysis of the pole structure of the integrals which are thus obtained. Our analysis has been done primarily for the 5-point functions. The result confirms previous expectations and prepares ground for a comparison with computations using matrix models techniques. "
"Using independent left and right vierbeins to describe graviton plus axion as suggested by string mechanics, O(d,d) duality can be realized linearly. "
"This is the first of a series of papers devoted to a systematic study of QCD correlation functions in a framework of 'instanton vacuum' models. The topic of this paper is to work out approximate formulae for quark propagators in a multi-instanton environment. As an application, and also as a necessary step toward understanding the correlation functions, we study the propagators of scalar and spinor quarks, using the simplest possible model, the so called 'random instanton vacuum' (RIV). Results related to heavy-light mesons, are found to be very consistent with phenomenology. "
"A simple model of the neutrino mixing is considered, which contains only one right-handed neutrino field, coupled via the mass term to the three usual left-handed fields. This is a simplest model that allows for three-flavour neutrino oscillations. The existing experimental limits on the neutrino oscillations are used to obtain constraints on the two free mixing parameters of the model. A specific sum rule relating the oscillation probabilities of different flavours is derived. "
"A general model-independent discussion of mesonic correlation functions is given. We derive new inequalities, including one stronger than Weingarten's inequality. Mesonic correlation functions are calculated in the random instanton vacuum and are compared with phenomenological expectations and lattice results. Both diagonal and non-diagonal correlators of all strange and light flavored currents, as well as the most important unflavored ones are considered. Our results are used to extract the masses and the coupling constants of the corresponding mesons. Not only the qualitative behaviour is reproduced in all channels, but in several channels the model works with amazing accuracy "
"The Poincare invariance in the temporal gauge canonical quantization of QCD is shown manifestly by verifying the energy-momentum-vector and angular-momentum-tensor satisfy the Poincare algebra in the physical Hilbert space. Two different values of \(\theta\) for the $\theta$-term in QCD lagrangian lead to different representations of the Poincare group, which are, however, connected by an unitary transformation. Thus the parameter \(\theta\) becomes physically irrelevant unless we can further restrict the physical Hilbert space. "
"Generalizing the results of Joshi and Dwivedi in Commun.Math.Phys. 146, p.333 (1992), it is pointed out that strong curvature naked singularities could occur in the self-similar gravitational collapse of any form of matter satisfying the weak energy condition for the positivity of mass-energy density. "
The prescription for the $\gamma_5$-matrix within dimensional regularization in multiloop calculations is elaborated. The three-loop anomalous dimension of the singlet axial current is calculated. 
We formulate the conformal bootstrap approach to four--fermion theory at its strong coupling fixed point in dimensions $2<d<4$. We present a solution of the bootstrap equations in the five--vertex approximation. We show that the bootstrap approach gives a particularly simple way to obtain next to leading order corrections to critical exponents in the large $N$ expansion and present the values of the anomalous dimensions of the fermion field $\psi$ and the composite $\bar\psi\psi$ to order $1/N^2$. 
"I discuss three subjects in thermal field theory: why in \sun gauge theories the \zn symmetry is broken at high (instead of low) temperature, the possible singularity structure of gauge variant propagators, and the problem of how to compute the viscosity from the Kubo formula. "
"We describe both the Bunce-Deddens C*-algebras and their Toeplitz versions, as crossed products of commutative C*-algebras by partial automorphisms. In the latter case, the commutative algebra has, as its spectrum, the union of the Cantor set and a copy the set of natural numbers N, fitted together in such a way that N is an open dense subset. The partial automorphism is induced by a map that acts like the odometer map on the Cantor set while being the translation by one on N. From this we deduce, by taking quotients, that the Bunce-Deddens C*-algebras are isomorphic to the (classical) crossed product of the algebra of continuous functions on the Cantor set by the odometer map. "
There is substancial overlap with hepth-9211081. More results are presented for duality in the non-compact case. It is argued that duality persists as a symmetry also in that case. 
This talk presents some progress achieved in collaboration with A.Linde and D.Linde towards understanding the true nature of the global spatial structure of the Universe as well as the most general stationary characteristics of its time-dependent state with eternally growing total volume. 
"Let $A$ denote the alternation limit algebra, studied by Hopenwasser and Power, and by Poon, which is the closed direct limit of upper triangular matrix algebras determined by refinement embeddings of multiplicity $r_k$ and standard embeddings of multiplicity $s_k$. It is shown that the quotient of the isometric automorphism group by the approximately inner automorphisms is the abelian group $ \ZZ ^d$ where $d$ is the number of primes that are divisors of infinitely many terms of each of the sequences $(r_k)$ and $(s_k)$. This group is also the group of automorphisms of the fundamental relation of $A$. "
"We study the global structure of the exact two-dimensional space-time which emerges from string theory. Previous work has shown that in the semi-classical limit, this is a black hole similar to the Schwarzschild solution. However, we find that in the exact case, a new Euclidean region appears ""between"" the singularity and black hole interior. However the boundary between the Lorentzian and Euclidean regions is a coordinate singularity, which turns out to be a surface of time reflection symmetry in an extended space-time. Thus strings having fallen through the black hole horizon would eventually emerge through another one into a new asymptotically flat region. The maximally extended space-time consists of an infinite number of universes connected by wormholes. There are no singularities present in this geometry. We also calculate the mass and temperature associated with the space-time. "
"The geometry of the spinning black holes of standard Einstein theory in 2+1 dimensions, with a negative cosmological constant and without couplings to matter, is analyzed in detail. It is shown that the black hole arises from identifications of points of anti-de Sitter space by a discrete subgroup of $SO(2,2)$. The generic black hole is a smooth manifold in the metric sense. The surface $r=0$ is not a curvature singularity but, rather, a singularity in the causal structure. Continuing past it would introduce closed timelike lines. However, simple examples show the regularity of the metric at $r=0$ to be unstable: couplings to matter bring in a curvature singularity there. Kruskal coordinates and Penrose diagrams are exhibited. Special attention is given to the limiting cases of (i) the spinless hole of zero mass, which differs from anti-de Sitter space and plays the role of the vacuum, and (ii) the spinning hole of maximal angular momentum . A thorough classification of the elements of the Lie algebra of $SO(2,2)$ is given in an Appendix. "
"We study the quantum $N=2$ super-$W_{3}$ algebra using the free field realization, which is obtained from the supersymmetric Miura transformation associated with the Lie superalgebra $A(2|1)$. We compute the full operator product expansions of the algebra explicitly. It is found that the results agree with those obtained by the OPE method. "
"We study a theory which generalizes the nonminimal coupling of matter to gravity by including derivative couplings. This leads to several interesting new dynamical phenomena in cosmology. In particular, the range of parameters in which inflationary attractors exist is greatly expanded. We also numerically integrate the field equations and draw the phase space of the model in second order approximation. The model introduced here may display different inflationary epochs, generating a non-scale-invariant fluctuation spectrum without the need of two or more fields. Finally, we comment on the bubble spectrum arising during a first-order phase transition occurring in our model. "
"We use a $\lambda\Phi^4$ scalar quantum field theory to illustrate a new approach to the study of quantum to classical transition. In this approach, the decoherence functional is employed to assign probabilities to consistent histories defined in terms of correlations among the fields at separate points, rather than the field itself. We present expressions for the quantum amplitudes associated with such histories, as well as for the decoherence functional between two of them. The dynamics of an individual consistent history may be described by a Langevin-type equation, which we derive. \noindent {\it Dedicated to Professor Brill on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday, August 1993} "
Gamma ray burst sources are isotropically distributed. They could be located at distances $\sim 1000$ AU. (Katz \cite{JK92}) GRB signals have many narrow peaks that are unresolved at the millisecond time resolution of existing observations. \cite{JK87} CETI could use stars as gravitational lenses for interstellar gamma ray laser beam communication. Much better time resolution of GRB signals could rule out (or confirm?) the speculative hypothesis that GRB = CETI. 
The 2D model of gravity with zweibeins $e^{a}$ and the Lorentz connection one-form $\omega^{a}_{\ b}$ as independent gravitational variables is considered and it is shown that the classical equations of motion are exactly integrated in coordinate system determined by components of 2D torsion. For some choice of integrating constant the solution is of the charged black hole type. The conserved charge and ADM mass of the black hole are calculated. 
"Using Peebles' least action principle, we determine trajectories for the galaxies in the Local Group and the more massive galaxies in the Local Neighbourhood. We deduce the resulting angular momentum for the whole of the Local Group and study the tidal force acting on the Local Group and its galaxies. Although Andromeda and the Milky Way dominate the tidal force acting on each other during the present epoch, we show that there is a transition time at $z\approx 1$ before which the tidal force is dominated by galaxies outside the Local Group in each case. This shows that the Local Group can not be considered as an isolated system as far as the tidal forces are concerned. We integrate the tidal torques acting on the Milky Way and Andromeda and derive their spin angular momenta, obtaining results which are comparable with observation. "
"A unified theory of all forces should be nonsingular. In such a unified theory, Einstein's general relativity will be a very low curvature effective theory. At larger curvatures, new terms will become important. The question then arises as to whether it is possible to construct an effective action for gravity which leads to a nonsingular theory. In this work, we construct an effective action for gravity in which all homogenerous and isotropic solutions are nonsingular. In particular, there is neither a big bang nor a big crunch. Preliminary work indicates that our construction provides a theory in which anisotropies decrease at large curvatures, and in which the inside of a black hole is singularity free. "
"Two sets of spatially diffeomorphism invariant operators are constructed in the loop representation formulation of quantum gravity. This is done by coupling general relativity to an anti- symmetric tensor gauge field and using that field to pick out sets of surfaces, with boundaries, in the spatial three manifold. The two sets of observables then measure the areas of these surfaces and the Wilson loops for the self-dual connection around their boundaries. The operators that represent these observables are finite and background independent when constructed through a proper regularization procedure. Furthermore, the spectra of the area operators are discrete so that the possible values that one can obtain by a measurement of the area of a physical surface in quantum gravity are valued in a discrete set that includes integral multiples of half the Planck area. These results make possible the construction of a correspondence between any three geometry whose curvature is small in Planck units and a diffeomorphism invariant state of the gravitational and matter fields. This correspondence relies on the approximation of the classical geometry by a piecewise flat Regge manifold, which is then put in correspondence with a diffeomorphism invariant state of the gravity-matter system in which the matter fields specify the faces of the triangulation and the gravitational field is in an eigenstate of the operators that measure their areas. "
We investigate strong and radiative meson decays in a generalized Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. The one loop order calculation provides a satisfactory agreement with the data for the mesonic spectrum and for radiative decays. Higher order effects for strong decays of $\rho$ and $K^*$ are estimated to be large. We also discuss the role of the flavour mixing determinantal interaction. 
"I present the reduction of phase space of the theory of an antisymmetric tensor potential coupled to an abelian gauge field, using Dirac's procedure. Duality transformations on the reduced phase space are also discussed. "
"Postulate of SL(2,\Z) invariance of toroidally compactified heterotic string theory in four dimensions implies the existence of new string (dual string) states carrying both, electric and magnetic charges. In this paper we study the interaction between these dual strings. In particular, we consider scattering of two such strings in the limit where one string passes through the other string without touching it, and show that such a scattering leads to the exchange of a fixed amount of electric and magnetic charges between the two strings. "
"I review recent developments in chiral perturbation theory (CHPT) which is the effective field theory of the standard model below the chiral symmetry breaking scale. The effective chiral Lagrangian formulated in terms of the pseudoscalar Goldstone bosons ($\pi, \, K, \, \eta$) is briefly discussed. It is shown how one can gain insight into the ratios of the light quark masses and to what extent these statements are model--independent. A few selected topics concerning the dynamics and interactions of the Goldstone bosons are considered. These are $\pi \pi$ and $\pi K$ scattering, some non--leptonic kaon decays and the problem of strong pionic final state interactions. CHPT also allows to make precise statements about the temperature dependence of QCD Green functions and the finite size effects related to the propagation of the (almost) massless pseudoscalar mesons. A central topic is the inclusion of matter fields, baryon CHPT. The relativistic and the heavy fermion formulation of coupling the baryons to the Goldstone fields are discussed. As applications, photo--nucleon processes, the $\pi N$ $\Sigma$--term and non--leptonic hyperon decays are presented. Implications of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry on the nuclear forces and meson exchange currents are also described. Finally, the use of effective field theory methods in the strongly coupled Higgs sector and in the calculation of oblique electroweak corrections is touched upon. "
"We give an elementary new method for obtaining rigorous lower bounds on the connective constant for self-avoiding walks on the hypercubic lattice $Z^d$. The method is based on loop erasure and restoration, and does not require exact enumeration data. Our bounds are best for high $d$, and in fact agree with the first four terms of the $1/d$ expansion for the connective constant. The bounds are the best to date for dimensions $d \geq 3$, but do not produce good results in two dimensions. For $d=3,4,5,6$, respectively, our lower bound is within 2.4\%, 0.43\%, 0.12\%, 0.044\% of the value estimated by series extrapolation. "
The survival probability of large rapidity gaps in pp collisions is calculated for several different eikonal models of the Gaussian form. Results obtained for models based on partonic interactions are quite similar. The Regge-pole model predicts a higher value of $ < \vert S \vert^{2} > $ . 
An elementary review of quantum cosmology. (Talk given at Texas/Pascos 1992 at Berkeley) 
"New results from the CDF Collaboration on the invariant mass distribution of dijet events observed at the Tevatron are used to constrain the masses and couplings of new gauge bosons ($W'$ and $Z'$) as well as fundamental diquarks which can occur in some extended electroweak models. In the case of new gauge bosons, these new bounds are then compared to existing limits which arise from searches for the leptonic decay modes of these particles at the Tevatron. "
"Using two methods, via fluctuations and correlations, an analytical formula is derived for the factorial multiplicity moments in a QCD jet at the Double Leading Logarithm accuracy. The resulting self-similar dependence on the solid-angle cell size is characteristic of an intermittency behaviour in angular variables. The intermittency indices depend on the diffusion angle through the running of $ \alpha_ s. $ Physical features of jet fluctuations such as collimation at large angles and saturation at small angles are well described in the perturbative framework. A parameter-free prediction of angular intermittency is proposed for $ {\cal Z}^0 $ decays into hadrons, assuming hadron-parton duality. "
"In this paper we solve for the quantum propagator of a general time dependent system quadratic in both position and momentum, linearly coupled to an infinite bath of harmonic oscillators. We work in the regime where the quantum optical master equation is valid. We map this master equation to a Schroedinger equation on Super-Hilbert space and utilize Lie Algebraic techniques to solve for the dynamics in this space. We then map back to the original Hilbert space to obtain the solution of the quantum dynamics. The Lie Algebraic techniques used are preferable to the standard Wei-Norman methods in that only coupled systems of first order ordinary differential equations and purely algebraic equations need only be solved. We look at two examples. "
"We report on measurements of the total cross section for e+e- --> 2-Gamma for center-of-mass energies between 57.4 and 59.5 GeV, using the AMY detector at the TRISTAN collider. We set new limits on the production of a possible new s-channel resonance decaying into photon pairs. "
We give an upper estimate for the number of gamma ray bursts from ordinary (non-superconducting) cosmic strings expected to be observed at terrestrial detectors. Assuming that cusp annihilation is the mechanism responsible for the bursts we consider strings arising at a GUT phase transition and compare our estimate with the recent BATSE results. Further we give a lower limit for the effective area of future detectors designed to detect the cosmic string induced flux of gamma ray bursts. 
"We discuss the characteristic interference features of soft radiation in the threshold production of heavy unstable particles: soft gluon radiation in $\ee \to \tt$ and soft photon radiation in $\ee \to \ww$. We show that the heavy particle decay width controls the interference between the emission off the final state particles. As a result, the radiation pattern may provide a way of measuring the decay width of the heavy particles. "
"We prove that if PT is a factorization of the identity operator on \ell_p^n through \ell_{\infty}^k, then ||P|| ||T|| \geq Cn^{1/p-1/2}(log n)^{-1/2}. This is a corollary of a more general result on factoring the identity operator on a quasi-normed space through \ell_{\infty}^k. "
"Following the approach of Grignani and Nardelli [1], we show how to cast the two-dimensional model $L \sim curv^2 + torsion^2 + cosm.const$ -- and in fact any theory of gravity -- into the form of a Poincare gauge theory. By means of the above example we then clarify the limitations of this approach: The diffeomorphism invariance of the action still leads to a nasty constraint algebra. Moreover, by simple changes of variables (e.g. in a path integral) one can reabsorb all the modifications of the original theory. "
We present a calculation of the coupling constants in the massive spin-1 field chiral Lagrangian to chiral ${\cal O}(p^3)$ in the context of an extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio cut-off model. Phenomenological applications of this Lagrangian to anomalous and non-anomalous low-energy hadronic transitions involving spin-1 particles are also discussed. 
"We give an explicit algebraic description of finite Lorentz transformations of vectors in 10-dimensional Minkowski space by means of a parameterization in terms of the octonions. The possible utility of these results for superstring theory is mentioned. Along the way we describe automorphisms of the two highest dimensional normed division algebras, namely the quaternions and the octonions, in terms of conjugation maps. We use similar techniques to define $SO(3)$ and $SO(7)$ via conjugation, $SO(4)$ via symmetric multiplication, and $SO(8)$ via both symmetric multiplication and one-sided multiplication. The non-commutativity and non-associativity of these division algebras plays a crucial role in our constructions. "
"We develop the approach of Faddeev, Reshetikhin, Takhtajan [1] and of Majid [2] that enables one to associate a quasitriangular Hopf algebra to every regular invertible constant solution of the quantum Yang-Baxter equations. We show that such a Hopf algebra is actually a quantum double. "
A free-parameter linear-combination-of-atomic-orbitals approach is presented for analyzing the stopping power of slow ions moving in a metal. The method is applied to the case of He moving in alkali metals. Mean stopping powers for He present a good agreement with local-density-approximation calculations. Our results show important variations in the stopping power of channeled atoms with respect to their mean values. 
We examine the processes $e^+ e^-\longrightarrow W^+ W^-$ and $Z^0 Z^0$ in the context of the $SP(6)_L\otimes U(1)_Y$ model. We find that there are significant deviations in the total cross sections $\sigma (s)$ from the standard model results due to the presence of additional gauge bosons $Z^\prime$ and $W^\prime$ in the model. These deviations could be detected at LEP. 
We reformulate the method recently proposed for constructing quasitriangular Hopf algebras of the quantum-double type from the R-matrices obeying the Yang-Baxter equations. Underlying algebraic structures of the method are elucidated and an illustration of its facilities is given. The latter produces an example of a new quasitriangular Hopf algebra. The corresponding universal R-matrix is presented as a formal power series. 
"The BRST operator cohomology of $N=2$ $2d$ supergravity coupled to matter is presented. Descent equations for primary superfields of the matter sector are derived. We find one copy of the cohomology at ghost number one, two independent copies at ghost number two, and conjecture that there is a copy at ghost number three. The $N=2$ string has a twisted $N=4$ superconformal symmetry generated by the $N=2$ superstress tensor, the BRST supercurrent, the antighost superfield, and the ghost number supercurrent. "
"The one-loop effective potential for a scalar field defined on an ultrastatic space-time whose spatial part is a compact hyperbolic manifold, is studied using zeta-function regularization for the one-loop effective action. Other possible regularizations are discussed in detail. The renormalization group equations are derived and their connection with the conformal anomaly is pointed out. The symmetry breaking and the topological mass generation are also discussed. "
"We have calculated the $\beta^+$ decay of the proton rich nuclei $^{44}$V in a full fp-shell valence space. We obtain a theoretical half-life of 71~ms compared with the experimental value t$_{1/2}$ = 90 $\pm$ 25 ms. Besides, we make predictions for the Gamow-Teller strength functions corresponding to the decays of the 2$^+$ ground state and 6$^+$ isomer state. "
"We discuss physical spectra and correlation functions of topological minimal models coupled to topological gravity. We first study the BRST formalism of these theories and show that their BRST operator $Q=Q_s+Q_v$ can be brought to $Q_s$ by a certain homotopy operator $U$, $UQU^{-1}=Q_s$ ($Q_s$ and $Q_v$ are the $N=2$ and diffeomorphism BRST operators, respectively). The reparametrization (anti)-ghost $b$ mixes with the supercharge operator $G$ under this transformation. Existence of this transformation enables us to use matter fields to represent cohomology classes of the operator $Q$. We explicitly construct gravitational descendants and show that they generate the higher-order KdV flows. We also evaluate genus-zero correlation functions and rederive basic recursion relations of two-dimensional topological gravity. "
"We review high--energy scattering processes that are sensitive to the hadronic structure of the photon, describing theoretical predictions as well as recent experimental results. These processes include deep--inelastic electron--photon scattering at \eplem\ colliders; and the production of jets, heavy quarks and isolated photons in the collision of real photons at \eplem\ colliders, as well as in photon--proton collisions at $ep$ colliders. We also comment on ``minijet'' based calculations of total $\gamma p$ and \gamgam\ cross--sections, and discuss the possibility that future linear \eplem\ colliders might produce very large photon fluxes due to the ``beamstrahlung'' phenomenon; in the most extreme cases, we predict more than one hadronic \gamgam\ event to occur at every bunch crossing. "
"The limiting bubble wall velocity during a first-order electroweak phase transition is of interest in scenarios for electroweak baryogenesis. Khlebnikov has recently proposed an interesting method for computing this velocity based on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. I demonstrate that at one-loop order this method is identical to simple, earlier techniques for computing the wall velocity based on computing the friction from particles reflecting off or transmitting through the wall in the ideal gas limit. "
"We investigate the structure of 13-particle clusters in binary alloys for various size ratios and different concentrations via MD simulation. Our goal is to predict which systems are likely to form local icosahedral structures when rapidly supercooled from the melt. We calculate the energy spectrum of the minimal energy structures, and characterize all detected minima from both their relative probability and from a structural point of view. We identify regions in our parameter space where the icosahedral structure is dominant (like in the corresponding monoatomic case), regions where the icosahedral structure disappears and other where icosahedral structures are present but not dominant. Finally, we compare our results with simulations reported in literature and performed on extended binary systems with various size ratios and at different concentration "
"Using Majorana Fermions to represent spins we re-examine the Kondo Lattice model for heavy fermions. The simplest decoupling procedure provides a realization of odd frequency superconductivity, with resonant pairing and surfaces of gap zeros. Spin and charge coherence factors vanish linearly with the energy on the Fermi surface, predicting a linear specific heat, but a $T^3$ NMR relaxation rate. Possible application to heavy fermions is suggested. "
We argue that CP--violation effects below a few tenths of a percent are probably undetectable at hadron and electron colliders. Thus only operators whose contributions interfere with tree--level Standard Model amplitudes are detectable. We list these operators for Standard Model external particles and some two and three body final state reactions that could show detectable effects. These could test electroweak baryogenesis scenarios. 
A generalization of the formula of Fine and Rao for the ranks of the intersection homology groups of a complex algebraic variety is given. The proof uses geometric properties of intersection homology and mixed Hodge theory. 
"Starting from the requirement that a Lagrangian field theory be invariant under both Schwinger-Dyson BRST and Schwinger-Dyson anti-BRST symmetry, we derive the BRST--anti-BRST analogue of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. This is done through standard Lagrangian gauge fixing respecting the extended BRST symmetry. The solutions of the resulting Master Equation and the gauge-fixing procedure for the quantum action can be brought into forms that coincide with those obtained earlier on algebraic grounds by Batalin, Lavrov and Tyutin. "
"Progress on the physics of strings in curved spacetime are comprehensively reviewed.We start by showing through renormalization group arguments that a meaningful quantum theory of gravity must be finite and must include all particle physics.Then, we review classical and quantum string propagation in curved spacetimes.We start by the general expansion method proposed by de Vega and S\'anchez in 1987. The particle transmutation phenomena in asymptotically flat spacetimes are detailed including fermion-boson transitions in supergravity backgrounds.The next chapters review the exactly solvable cases of string propagation: shock waves, singular plane waves, conical spacetimes and de Sitter cosmological spacetime. The calculation of various physical quantities like the string mass and the energy-momentum tensor shows that classical and quantum string propagation in shock-waves and singular plane waves is physically meaningful and full of interesting new phenomena.The important phenomenom of {\bf string stretching} that takes place when strings fall into spacetime singularities and in expanding universes is analyzed.We conclude by reporting on strings in de Sitter spacetime, where the string equations are integrable and reduce to the sinh-Gordon equation and to integrable generalizations of it. Lectures delivered at the ERICE SCHOOL ``STRING QUANTUM GRAVITY AND PHYSICS AT THE PLANCK ENERGY SCALE'', 21-28 June 1992 , to appear in the Proceedings edited by N. S\'anchez, World Scientific. "
"We review our analysis of the strong coupling of compact QED on a lattice with staggered Fermions. We show that, for infinite coupling, compact QED is exactly mapped in a quantum antiferromagnet. We discuss some aspects of this correspondence relevant for effective field theories of Josephson junctions arrays. "
"Using the Bethe ansatz analysis as was reformulated by Edwards, we calculate the spectral properties of a particle interacting with a bath of fermions in one dimension for the case of equal particle-fermion masses. These are directly related to singularities apparent in optical experiments in one dimensional systems. The orthogonality catastrophe for the case of an infinite particle mass survives in the limit of equal masses. We find that the exponent $\beta$ of the quasiparticle weight, $Z\simeq N^{-\beta}$ is different for the two cases, and proportional to their respective phaseshifts at the Fermi surface; we present a simple physical argument for this difference. We also show that these exponents describe the low energy behavior of the spectral function, for repulsive as well as attractive interaction. "
"We give a complete geometric description of conformal anomalies in arbitrary, (necessarily even) dimension. They fall into two distinct classes: the first, based on Weyl invariants that vanish at integer dimensions, arises from finite -- and hence scale-free -- contributions to the effective gravitational action through a mechanism analogous to that of the (gauge field) chiral anomaly. Like the latter, it is unique and proportional to a topological term, the Euler density of the dimension, thereby preserving scale invariance. The contributions of the second class, requiring introduction of a scale through regularization, are correlated to all local conformal scalar polynomials involving powers of the Weyl tensor and its derivatives; their number increases rapidly with dimension. Explicit illustrations in dimensions 2, 4 and 6 are provided. "
"Calculations are presented of the longitudinal structure function $F_L(x, Q^2)$. We use next-to-leading order expressions in QCD $({\cal{O}}(\alpha_s^2))$ plus parton densities determined previously from global fits to data on deep inelastic lepton scattering, prompt photon production, and bottom quark production. Anticipated data from the DESY ep collider HERA should provide discriminating information on the gluon density, particularly for values of $x < 0.05$. "
"A wide class of boundary problems in quantum mechanics is discussed by using path integrals. This includes motion in half-spaces, radial boxes, rings, and moving boundaries. As a preparation the formalism for the incorporation of $\delta$-function perturbations is outlined, which includes the discussion of multiple $\delta$-function perturbations, $\delta$-function perturbations along perpendicular lines and planes, and moving $\delta$-function perturbations. The limiting process, where the strength of the $\delta$-function perturbations gets infinite repulsive, has the effect of producing impenetrable walls at the locations of the $\delta$-function perturbations, i.e.\ a consistent description for boundary problems with Dirichlet boundary-condition emerges. Several examples illustrate the formalism. "
"A systematic classification of Feynman path integrals in quantum mechanics is presented and a table of solvable path integrals is given which reflects the progress made during the last ten years or so, including, of course, the main contributions since the invention of the path integral by Feynman in 1942. An outline of the general theory is given. Explicit formul\ae\ for the so-called basic path integrals are presented on which our general scheme to classify and calculate path integrals in quantum mechanics is based. "
"A specific class of explicitly time-dependent potentials is studied by means of path integrals. For this purpose a general formalism to treat explicitly time-dependent space-time transformations in path integrals is sketched. An explicit time-dependent model under consideration is of the form $V(q,t)=V[q/\zeta(t)]/\zeta^2(t)$, where $V$ is a usual potential, and $\zeta(t)=(at^2+2bt+c)^{1/2}$. A recent result of Dodonov et al.\ for calculating corresponding propagators is incorporated into the path integral formalism by performing a space-time transformation. Some examples illustrate the formalism. "
"I address the question of whether supersymmetry provides a viable candidate for the dark matter in the Universe. I review the properties of the lightest neutralino as a candidate for solving the dark matter problem. I discuss the neutralino's phenomenological and cosmological properties, and constraints from present and future experiments. In the minimal supersymmetric model, the neutralino mass has been experimentally excluded below some $20$ GeV, and is not expected to be significantly larger than about $150$ GeV. I identify a gaugino-like neutralino as the most natural dark matter candidate for a plausible range of parameters. The requirement that the lightest neutralino be the dominant matter component in the flat Universe provides non-trivial restrictions on other parameters of the model, in particular on the masses of the sfermions. Next, I study the consequences of adopting further grand unification assumptions. In both scenarios I find sfermion masses most likely beyond the reach of LEP 200 and the Tevatron but well within the discovery potential of the SSC and the LHC. I also comment on the effects of relaxing grand unification assumptions. Finally, I briefly outline prospects for the neutralino dark matter searches. "
"This paper is the third in a sequel to develop a super-analogue of the classical Selberg trace formula, the Selberg supertrace formula. It deals with bordered super Riemann surfaces. The theory of bordered super Riemann surfaces is outlined, and the corresponding Selberg supertrace formula is developed. The analytic properties of the Selberg super zeta-functions on bordered super Riemann surfaces are discussed, and super-determinants of Dirac-Laplace operators on bordered super Riemann surfaces are calculated in terms of Selberg super zeta-functions. "
"Recently a new supersymmetric extension of the KdV hierarchy has appeared in a matrix-model-inspired approach to $2{-}d$ quantum supergravity. Here we prove that this hierarchy is essentially the KdV hierarchy, where the KdV field is now replaced by an even superfield. This allows us to find the conserved charges and the bihamiltonian structure, and to prove its integrability. We also extend the hierarchy by odd flows in a supersymmetric fashion. "
"Wormhole solutions corresponding to space-time geometries $R^1\times S^1\times S^2$ and $R^1\times S^3$ are obtained from reduced string effective action and the action is written in a manifestly $O(d,d)$ invariant form. A general treatment is given for obtaining wormhole solutions of different topologies from dimensional reduction. For specific ansatz of internal metric and antisymmetric field the reduced action is shown to have a global $SL(2,C)$ symmetry. The $SL(2,C)$ and duality symmetries have been exploited to generate new configurations of internal fields which produce wormhole solutions in four space-time dimensions. The $SL(2,C)$ symmetry discussed in this paper arises due to specific form of the moduli and these transformations belong to a subgroup of $O(d,d)$ global symmetry. "
"Two quantum theories are physically equivalent if they are related, not by a unitary transformation, but by an isometric transformation. The conditions under which a quantum canonical transformation is an isometric transformation are given. "
"We study N=2 SuperVirasoro SCFT for the generic value of the central charge. The main tool is the nonstandard bosonisation suggested in \ref\rRoz{L. Rozansky a letter to M. Bershadsky, 1989}, \ref\rSeBGR{B. Gato-Rivera, A. Semikhatov Phys. Letts. B293 (1992) 72},\ref\rBLNW{M. Bershadsky, W. Lerche, D. Nemeshansky, N. Warner N=2 Extended superconformal structure of Gravity and W Gravity coupled to Matter HUTP-A034/92}. The free field resolutions for the irreducible representations are obtained; the characters of these representations are computed. The quantum hamiltonian reduction from the Kac-Moody $\hat{sl}_k(2|1)$ to N=2 $SVir$ is constructed. "
"We present a way of constructing string solutions around non-trivial gravitational backgrounds. The proposed solutions are constructed using $N = 4$ superconformal building blocks with $\hat c = 4$. We give two different and inequivalent realizations of non-trivial four-dimensional subspaces, and we show the emergence of the $N = 4$ globally defined superconformal symmetry. The existence of $N = 4$ world-sheet symmetry stabilizes our solutions and implies in target space a number of covariantized supersymmetries around space-time dependent gravitational and dilaton backgrounds. "
"We study the spectra of G/G coset models by computing BRST cohomology of affine Lie algebras with coefficients in tensor product of two modules. One-to-one correspondence between the spectra of $A_1^1/A_1^1$ and that of the minimal matter coupled to gravity (including boundary states of the Kac table) is observed. This phenomena is discussed from the point of hamiltonian reduction of BRST complexes of $A_N^1$ Lie algebras. (In the revised version one proof is modified and examplified, some misprints are corrected.) "
"Quantum canonical transformations are defined in analogy to classical canonical transformations as changes of the phase space variables which preserve the Dirac bracket structure. In themselves, they are neither unitary nor non-unitary. A definition of quantum integrability in terms of canonical transformations is proposed which includes systems which have fewer commuting integrals of motion than degrees of freedom. The important role of non-unitary transformations in integrability is discussed. "
"A \rep of \sun, which diverges in the limit of \cl, is investigated. This is an infinite dimensional and a non-unitary \rep, defined for the real value of $ q, \ 0 < q < 1. $ Each \irrep is specified by $ n $ continuous variables and one discrete variable. This \rep gives a new solution of the Yang-Baxter equation, when the R-matrix is evaluated. It is shown that a continuous variables can be regarded as a spectral parameter. "
"The requirements of conformal invariance for the two point function of the energy momentum tensor in the neighbourhood of a plane boundary are investigated, restricting the conformal group to those transformations leaving the boundary invariant. It is shown that the general solution may contain an arbitrary function of a single conformally invariant variable $v$, except in dimension 2. The functional dependence on $v$ is determined for free scalar and fermion fields in arbitrary dimension $d$ and also to leading order in the $\vep$ expansion about $d=4$ for the non Gaussian fixed point in $\phi^4$ theory. The two point correlation function of the energy momentum tensor and a scalar field is also shown to have a unique expression in terms of $v$ and the overall coefficient is determined by the operator product expansion. The energy momentum tensor on a general curved manifold is further discussed by considering variations of the metric. In the presence of a boundary this procedure naturally defines extra boundary operators. By considering diffeomorphisms these are related to components of the energy momentum tensor on the boundary. The implications of Weyl invariance in this framework are also derived. "
"In the current paradigm there is a non-trivial bias expected in the process of galaxy formation. Thus, the observed statistical properties of the galaxy distribution do not necessarily extend to the underlying matter distribution. Gravitational evolution of initially Gaussian seed fluctuations predicts that the connected moments of the matter fluctuations exhibit a hierarchical structure, at least in the limit of small dispersion. This same hierarchical structure has been found in the galaxy distribution, but it is not clear to what extent it reflects properties of the matter distribution or properties of a galaxy formation bias. In this paper we consider the consequences of an arbitrary, effectively local biasing transformation of a hierarchical underlying matter distribution. We show that a general form of such a transformation preserves the hierarchical properties and the shape of the dispersion in the limit of small fluctuations, i.e. on large scales, although the values of the "
"We estimate, using a large-scale Monte Carlo simulation, the critical exponents of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a stacked triangular lattice. We obtain the following estimates: $\gamma/\nu= 2.011 \pm .014 $, $\nu= .585 \pm .009 $. These results contradict a perturbative $2+\epsilon$ Renormalization Group calculation that points to Wilson-Fisher O(4) behaviour. While these results may be coherent with $4-\epsilon$ results from Landau-Ginzburg analysis, they show the existence of an unexpectedly rich structure of the Renormalization Group flow as a function of the dimensionality and the number of components of the order parameter. "
"We show that all important features of 2d gravity coupled to $c<1$ matter can be easily understood from the canonical quantization approach a la Dirac. Furthermore, we construct a canonical transformation which maps the theory into a free-field form, i.e. the constraints become free-field Virasoro generators with background charges. This implies the gauge independence of the David-Distler-Kawai results, and also proves the free-field assumption which was used for obtaining the spectrum of the theory in the conformal gauge. A discussion of the unitarity of the physical spectrum is presented and we point out that the scalar products of the discrete states are not well defined in the standard Fock space framework. "
"Recently, Madsen has argued that relativistic decays of massive neutrinos into lighter fermions and bosons may lead, via thermalization, to the formation of a Bose condensate. If correct, this could generate mixed hot and cold dark matter, with important consequences for structure formation. From a detailed study of such decays, we arrive at substantially different conclusions; for a wide range of masses and decay times, we find that stimulated emission of bosons dominates the decay. This phenomenon can best be described as a neutrino laser, pumped by the QCD phase transition. We discuss the implications for structure formation and the dark-matter problem. "
"The recent LEP data for gauge coupling constants constrain many grand unified models. In this paper, we study several possibilities for unification of gauge coupling constants. Without an intermediate mass scale, the minimal supersymmetric standard model is the only possibility. For one intermediate mass scale, it is possible to have many routes toward grand unification: $SO(10)\rightarrow SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1) , SU(7), SU(8)$, etc. We present also simple relations for the possibility of unification. "
A simple direct explicit proof of the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics is given for a quasistationary semiclassical black hole. 
"A quantum deformation of 4-dimensional superconformal algebra realized on quantum superspace is investigated. We study the differential calculus and the action of the quantum generators corresponding to $sl_q(1|4)$ which act on the quantum superspace. We derive deformed $su(1|2,2)$ algebras from the deformed $sl(1|4)$ algebra. Through a contraction procedure we obtain a deformed super-Poincar{\'e} algebra. "
We described the $q$-deformed phase space. The $q$-deformed Hamilton eqations of motion are derived and discussed. Some simple models are considered. 
"An exact solution of the low-energy string theory representing static, spherical symmetric dyonic black hole is found. The solution is labeled by their mass, electric charge, magnetic charge and asymptotic value of the scalar dilaton. Some interesting properties of the dyonic black holes are studied. In particular, the Hawking temperature of dyonic black holes depends on both the electric and magnetic charges, and the extremal ones, which have nonzero electric and magnetic charges, have zero temperature but nonzero entropy. These properties are quite different from those of electrically (or magnetically) charged dilaton black holes found by Gibbons {\it et al.} and Garfinkle {\it et al.}, but are the same as those of the dyonic black holes found by Gibbons and Maeda. After this paper was submitted for publication, D. Wiltshire told us that solutions, eqs.(22)-(28), are related to Gibbons-Maeda dyonic black hole solutions by a coordinate transformation and some parameters reparametization \cite{26}. And, we were also informed that many of our results were previously obtained by Kallosh {\it et al.} \cite{27}. The dyonic black hole solutions, eqs.(22)-(28), are also related to those of reference \cite{27} by another coordinate "
"A simple approximation which captures some non-perturbative aspects of the one electron Green function of strongly interacting Fermion systems is developed. It provides a way to go one step beyond the usual dilute limit since particle-particle as well as particle-hole scattering are treated on the same footing. Intermediate states are constrained to contain only one particle-hole excitation besides the incoming particle. The Faddeev equations resulting from an exact treatment of this three-body problem are investigated. In one dimension the method is able to show spin and charge decoupling, but does not reproduce the exact nature of power-law singularities. Hey dudes, check out the analytical solution in section III! "
"We study the massive Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics of massive, Dirac fermions, in 1+1 dimensions; with space compactified to a circle. In the limit that transitions to fermion--anti-fermion pairs can be neglected, we study the full ground state. We focus on the effect of instantons which mediate tunnelling transitions in the induced potential for the dynamical degree of freedom in the gauge field. "
"We investigate some issues relating to recently proposed fractional superstring theories with $D_{\rm critical}<10$. Using the factorization approach of Gepner and Qiu, we systematically rederive the partition functions of the $K=4,\, 8,$ and $16$ theories and examine their spacetime supersymmetry. Generalized GSO projection operators for the $K=4$ model are found. Uniqueness of the twist field, $\phi^{K/4}_{K/4}$, as source of spacetime fermions is demonstrated. Last, we derive a linear (rather than quadratic) relationship between the required conformal anomaly and the conformal dimension of the supercurrent ghost. "
"Trajectory scaling functions are the basic element in the study of chaotic dynamical systems, from which any long time average can be computed. It has never been extracted from an experimental time series the reason being its sensitivity to noise. It is shown, by numerical simulations, that the sensitivity of the scaling function is to drift in the control parameters, and not noise. It is also explained how naive averaging of the orbit points may lead to erroneous results. "
"We consider the effects of excited states on the $SU(3)$ breaking chiral loop corrections to heavy meson properties. In particular, we compare the size of kaon loops in which an excited heavy meson appears to the size of previously calculated loops with heavy mesons in the ground state. We find that the new effects may indeed be of the same magnitude as the old ones, but that there is a strong dependence on the unknown masses and coupling constants of the new states. As a result, we argue that the ground state loops alone may not be a trustworthy guide to $SU(3)$ corrections, and that the appropriate cutoff for a heavy-light chiral lagrangian which omits excited heavy mesons may be considerably smaller than the na\""\i ve expectation of $\Lambda_\chi\approx 1\gev$. "
A gauge invariant method for the investigation of scalar diquark clustering in the nucleon ground state is presented. The method focuses on a comparison of quark distributions in the nucleon with those in the $\Delta$ baryon resonance. Recent lattice QCD calculations of these quark distribution radii are analyzed in a search for evidence of scalar diquark clustering. The analysis indicates the lattice results describe the negative squared charge radius of the neutron with little resort to hyperfine clustering between $u$-$d$-quark pairs. This result contrasts both quark-diquark and nonrelativistic quark models where hyperfine attraction between $u$ and $d$ quarks in the nucleon is argued to play a significant role. Comparison of light quark distributions in $\Lambda^0$ and $\Sigma^{*0}$ indicate only a small reduction of the scalar diquark distribution radius relative to the vector diquark distribution. Current lattice QCD determinations of baryon charge distributions do not support the concept of substantial $u$-$d$ scalar diquark clustering as an appropriate description of the internal structure of the nucleon. 
"The question of the renormalization scheme dependence of the $\tau$ semileptonic decay rate is revisited in response to a recent criticism. Particular attention is payed to a distinction between a consistent quantitative description of this dependence and the actual selection of a subset of ``acceptable'' renormalization schemes. It is argued that a reasonable universal measure of the renormalization scheme dependence can be formulated, which gives encouraging results when applied to various physical quantities, including the semileptonic $\tau$ decay rate. "
"Motivated by recent experiments at LEP ($Z \to l^+l^-\gamma\gamma$, with $M_{\gamma\gamma} \simeq 59 GeV$), we examine the possibility that such events are explained by a Bjorken process with a resonant Higgs ($M_{h^o} \simeq 59 GeV$) decaying to $\gamma\gamma$. Our model is an N-doublet-Higgs model without CP-violation. Under the simplifying assumption that $(N-k)$ doublets ($k \geq 1$) decouple from the fermion sector, we could explain the observed events if: i) $(N-1) \geq 2$ and ii) the masses of the corresponding $(N-1)$ neutral scalars are either completely or almost degenerate, i.e. the decay $Z \to l^+l^- \gamma\gamma$ proceeds now via several overlapping resonances. "
"This paper is devoted to the exploration of some of the geometrical issues raised by the $N=2$ superstring. We begin by reviewing the reasons that $\beta$-functions for the $N=2$ superstring require it to live in a four-dimensional self-dual spacetime of signature $(--++)$, together with some of the arguments as to why the only degree of freedom in the theory is that described by the gravitational field. We then move on to describe at length the geometry of flat space, and how a real version of twistor theory is relevant to it. We then describe some of the more complicated spacetimes that satisfy the $\beta$-function equations. Finally we speculate on the deeper significance of some of these spacetimes. "
"We study a string-inspired classical 2-D effective field theory with {\it nonsingular} black holes as well as Witten's black hole among its static solutions. By a dimensional reduction, the static solutions are related to the $(SL(2,R)_{k}\otimes U(1))/U(1)$ coset model, or more precisely its $O\bigl((\alpha')^{0}\bigr)$ approximation known as the 3-D charged black string. The 2-D effective action possesses a propagating degree of freedom, and the dynamics are highly nontrivial. A collapsing shell is shown to bounce into another universe without creating a curvature singularity on its path, and the potential instability of the Cauchy horizon is found to be irrelevent in that some of the infalling observers never approach the Cauchy horizon. Finally a $SL(2,R)_{k}/U(1)$ nonperturbative coset metric, found and advocated by R. Dijkgraaf et.al., is shown to be nonsingular and to coincide with one of the charged spacetimes found above. Implications of all these geometries are discussed in connection with black hole evaporation. "
"In close analogy to diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) and inspired by a work of Roux, a random walker algorithm is constructed to solve the problem of crack growth in an elastic medium. In contrast to conventional lattice approaches, the stress field is not calculated throughout the whole medium, but random walkers are used to detect only the hot sites on the surface of the crack. Using this new method we generate crack-clusters up to sizes of 20,000 particles on simple workstations within reasonable time. "
"It has been suggested that the suppression of $J/\psi$ production in heavy nuclei is a signature of the formation of quark-gluon plasma. We here show that this phenomenon can be understood in terms of conventional physics, {\it i.e.} {\it i)} perturbative QCD, {\it ii)} the parton recombination implementation of shadowing in the initial state, and {\it iii)} final state interactions with the hadronic debris of the nuclear target. Unlike previous calculations we include both the direct $J/\psi$ production and its production via radiative $\chi$ decays ($\chi_J \to J/\psi + \gamma$). We are able to reproduce the experimental data including their small-$x$ behavior. We emphasize the importance of studying the $x_2$-dependence of the ratio $\sigma(b A)/\sigma(b N)$, where $b$ designates the beam and $x_2$ is the momentum fraction of the parton from the nuclear target. "
We explore the possibility of having new physics which could account for the $l^+l^-\gamma\gamma$ events with $M_{\gamma\gamma}\simeq 60\ $GeV recently reported by LEP. We consider models which contain an extra neutral gauge boson ($Z'$) that couples only to right-handed fermions. The models naturally require at least three quark and lepton families from anomaly cancellation. We find simple realizations of such models that have $\ell^+\ell^-\gamma\gamma$ events at a rate similar to that observed at LEP. 
"The finite-temperature one-loop effective potential for a scalar field in the static de Sitter space-time is obtained. Within this framework, by using zeta-function regularization, one can get, in the conformally invariant case, the explicit expression for the stress tensor anomaly. Its value turns out to depend on the thermal state of the system. This conclusion is different from the one derived by other authors, who considered thermal properties of ultraviolet divergences in static spaces ignoring the effects of horizons. The behaviour of the effective potential in the ground state and in de Sitter-invariant state is also studied, showing the role played by the curvature on the minima. "
"Braided differential operators $\del^i$ are obtained by differentiating the addition law on the braided covector spaces introduced previously (such as the braided addition law on the quantum plane). These are affiliated to a Yang-Baxter matrix $R$. The quantum eigenfunctions $\exp_R(\vecx|\vecv)$ of the $\del^i$ (braided-plane waves) are introduced in the free case where the position components $x_i$ are totally non-commuting. We prove a braided $R$-binomial theorem and a braided-Taylors theorem $\exp_R(\veca|\del)f(\vecx)=f(\veca+\vecx)$. These various results precisely generalise to a generic $R$-matrix (and hence to $n$-dimensions) the well-known properties of the usual 1-dimensional $q$-differential and $q$-exponential. As a related application, we show that the q-Heisenberg algebra $px-qxp=1$ is a braided semidirect product $\C[x]\cocross \C[p]$ of the braided line acting on itself (a braided Weyl algebra). Similarly for its generalization to an arbitrary $R$-matrix. "
"We derive nonstrange baryon-baryon scattering amplitudes in the nonrelativistic quark model using the ``quark Born diagram"" formalism. This approach describes the scattering as a single interaction, here the one-gluon-exchange (OGE) spin-spin term followed by constituent interchange, with external nonrelativistic baryon wavefunctions attached to the scattering diagrams to incorporate higher-twist wavefunction effects. The short-range repulsive core in the NN interaction has previously been attributed to this spin-spin interaction in the literature; we find that these perturbative constituent-interchange diagrams do indeed predict repulsive interactions in all I,S channels of the nucleon-nucleon system, and we compare our results for the equivalent short-range potentials to the core potentials found by other authors using nonperturbative methods. We also apply our perturbative techniques to the N$\Delta$ and $\Delta\Delta$ systems: Some $\Delta\Delta$ channels are found to have attractive core potentials and may accommodate ``molecular"" bound states near threshold. Finally we use our Born formalism to calculate the NN differential cross section, which we compare with experimental results for unpolarised proton-proton elastic scattering. We find that several familiar features of the experimental differential cross section are reproduced by our Born-order result. "
"We derive the electric and magnetic form factors of the neutron in the framework of a relativistic constituent quark model. Our parameter free prediction agrees well with a recent, accurate measurement. The relativistic features of the model and the specific form of the wave function are essential for the result. Comparisons are made to other models based on VMD, PQCD and QCD sum rules. "
We construct a quantum Hamiltonian operator for the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in terms of the Casimir operator. This facilitates the discussion of the reduction of the WZW model to Toda field theory at the quantum level and provides a very straightforward derivation of the quantum central charge for the Toda field theory. 
"We study the stability of small strangelets by employing a simple model of strange matter as a gas of non-interacting fermions confined in a bag. We solve the Dirac equation and populate the energy levels of the bag one quark at a time. Our results show that for system parameters such that strange matter is unbound in bulk, there may still exist strangelets with $A<100$ that are stable and/or metastable. The lifetime of these strangelets may be too small to detect in current accelerator experiments, however. "
"It is shown that the attempt to extend the notion of ideal measurement to quantum field theory leads to a conflict with locality, because (for most observables) the state vector reduction associated with an ideal measurement acts to transmit information faster than light. Two examples of such information-transfer are given, first in the quantum mechanics of a pair of coupled subsystems, and then for the free scalar field in flat spacetime. It is argued that this problem leaves the Hilbert space formulation of quantum field theory with no definite measurement theory, removing whatever advantages it may have seemed to possess vis a vis the sum-over-histories approach, and reinforcing the view that a sum-over-histories framework is the most promising one for quantum gravity. "
"We present a static solution for $d = 2$ critical string theory including the tachyon $T$ but not its potential $V(T)$. This solution thus incorporates tachyon back reaction and, when $T = 0$, reduces to the black hole solution. When $T \neq 0$ one finds that (1) the Schwarzschild horizon of the above black hole splits into two, resembling Reissner-Nordstrom horizons and (2) the curvature scalar develops new singularities at the horizons. These features, as we argue, will persist even with $V(T)$ present. Some possible methods for removing these singularities are discussed. "
"The two--loop mechanism of Bjorken and Weinberg is used to constrain flavor changing neutral Higgs bosons. We calculate the complete set of two--loop diagrams for the rare decay $\mu \rightarrow e + \gamma$ induced by such neutral Higgs bosons, for arbitrary Higgs and top masses. The analytic result is used to set limits on Higgs masses for some recent models with specific ansatz about the flavor changing couplings. For example, in the Cheng--Sher scenario of multi-Higgs doublet models, all neutral Higgs bosons possess flavor changing ($f_i \leftrightarrow f_j)$ couplings proportional to $\sqrt{m_i m_j}$. We find that the present limit on $\mu\to e\gamma$ implies that, in such scheme, these neutral Higgs bosons should be heavier than $200$ GeV. "
"We rewrite various lattice Hamiltonian in condensed matter physics in terms of U(2/2) operators that we introduce. In this representation the symmetry structure of the models becomes clear. Especially, the Heisenberg, the supersymmetric t-J and a newly proposed high-$T_c$ superconducting Hamiltonian reduce to the same form $H=$$-t\sum_{<jk>}\sum_{ac}X^{ac}_j X^{ca}_k (-1)^{F(c)}$. This representation also gives us a systematic way of searching for the symmetries of the system. "
"Errata are given for ""The Higgs Hunter's Guide"". These errata should be applied to the second printing of the book, dated 1991. The second printing has already corrected numerous errors and misprints contained in the originally published 1990 edition. "
A global fit for experiments is included in this revised version. 
"The renormalization-group improved effective potential for an arbitrary renormalizable massless gauge theory in curved spacetime is found,thus generalizing Coleman-Weinberg's approach corresponding to flat space.Some explicit examples are considered,among of them:scalar self-interacting theory,scalar electrody namics,the asymptotically-free SU(2) gauge model,and the SU(5) GUT theory. The possibility of curvature-induced phase transitions is analyzed.It is shown that such a phase transition may take place in a SU(5) inflationary universe.The inclusion of quantum gravity effects isbriefly discussed. "
"The spin-4/3 fractional superstring is characterized by a chiral algebra involving a spin-4/3 current on the world-sheet in addition to the energy-momentum tensor. These currents generate physical state conditions on the fractional superstring Fock space. Scattering amplitudes of these physical states are described which satisfy both spurious state decoupling and cyclic symmetry (duality). Examples of such amplitudes are calculated using an explicit $c=5$ realization of the spin-4/3 current algebra. This representation has three flat coordinate boson fields and a global SO(2,1) Lorentz symmetry, permitting a particle interpretation of the amplitudes. "
"The coefficients appearing at leading and subleading order in the $1/m$ expansion of bilinear heavy quark currents are related to each other by imposing reparametrization invariance on both the effective current operators and the short-distance coefficient functions in the heavy quark effective theory. When combined with present knowledge about the leading order coefficients, the results allow to calculate all coefficients appearing at order $1/m$ to next-to-leading order in renormalization-group improved perturbation theory. They also provide a meaningful definition of the velocity transfer variable $v\cdot v'$ to order $1/m$. "
"The low-energy scattering of charged fermions by extremal magnetic Reissner-Nordstrom black holes is analyzed in the large-$N$ and $S$-wave approximations. It is shown that (in these approximations) information is carried into a causally inaccessible region of spacetime, and thereby effectively lost. It is also shown that there is an infinite degeneracy of quantum black hole ground states, or ``remnants"", which store --- but will not reveal --- the information. A notable feature of the analysis --- not shared by recent analyses of dilatonic black holes --- is that the key physical questions can be answered within the weak coupling domain. We regard these results as strong evidence that effective information loss occurs in our universe. "
"We investigate the possibility of generalizing differential renormalization of D.Z.Freedman, K.Johnson and J.I.Latorre in an invariant fashion to theories with infrared divergencies via an infrared $\tilde{R}$ operation. Two-dimensional $\sigma$ models and the four-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory diagrams with exceptional momenta are used as examples, while dimensional renormalization serves as a test scheme for comparison. We write the basic differential identities of the method simultaneously in co-ordinate and momentum space, introducing two scales which remove ultraviolet and infrared singularities. The consistent set of Fourier-transformation formulae is derived. However, the values for tadpole-type Feynman integrals in higher orders of perturbation theory prove to be ambiguous, depending on the order of evaluation of the subgraphs. In two dimensions, even earlier than this ambiguity manifests itself, renormalization-group calculations based on infrared extension of differential renormalization lead to incorrect results. We conclude that the extended differential renormalization procedure does not perform the infrared $\tilde{R}$ operation in a self-consistent way, as the original recipe does the ultraviolet $R$ operation. "
"Let $u:A\to B$ be a bounded linear operator between two $C^*$-algebras $A,B$. The following result was proved by the second author. Theorem 0.1. There is a numerical constant $K_1$ such that for all finite sequences $x_1,\ldots, x_n$ in $A$ we have $$\leqalignno{&\max\left\{\left\|\left(\sum u(x_i)^* u(x_i)\right)^{1/2}\right\|_B, \left\|\left(\sum u(x_i) u(x_i)^*\right)^{1/2}\right\|_B\right\}&(0.1)_1\cr \le &K_1\|u\| \max\left\{\left\|\left(\sum x^*_ix_i\right)^{1/2}\right\|_A, \left\|\left(\sum x_ix^*_i\right)^{1/2}\right\|_A\right\}.}$$ A simpler proof was given in [H1]. More recently an other alternate proof appeared in [LPP]. In this paper we give a sequence of generalizations of this inequality. "
"We compute the time-dependent coverage in the random sequential adsorption of aligned d-dimensional cubes in $R^d$ using time-series expansions. The seventh-order series in 2, 3 and 4 dimensions is resummed in order to predict the coverage at jamming. The result is in agreement with Monte-Carlo simulations. A simple argument, based on a property of the perturbative expansion valid at arbitrary orders, allows us to analytically derive some generalizations of the Pal\'asti approximation. "
"The production of photon pairs in $e^+e^-\rightarrow f \bar f \gamma\gamma$ processes is studied using exact helicity amplitudes at tree level. Total cross sections, including initial state radiation effects, are given. They are presented in the case of quarks as a function of $y_{\rm cut}$ in the JADE algorithm. In the case of leptons we use cuts similar to the ones employed in a recent L3 analysis. Masses of the final state fermions are taken into account when appropriate. The cross section $e^+e^-\rightarrow \tau^+ \tau^- \gamma\gamma$ is about 10\% larger when the $\tau$ mass is neglected. We obtain, with a different method, results which are in good agreement with L3 Montecarlo simulation. "
"Formulae are derived for the spectra of scalar curvature perturbations and gravitational waves produced during inflation, special cases of which include power law inflation, natural inflation in the small angle approximation and inflation in the slow roll approximation. "
"We extend Dirac's `extensible model of the electron' to include spin and family. $U(1)_{e.m.}$ charge conservation on the bubble is translated into a secondary $U(1)_{g}$ world-manifold gauge principle. Reflecting the secondary magnetic monopole configuration on spatial $S^2$, the harmonic excitations may furnish half integer $SU(2)_{spin}\otimes U(1)_{g}$ representations. Our spin--$1/2$ `electron' is described by four world-manifold scalar fields. Its three varieties are associated with different minima of the (6th--order) surface-tension scalar potential. "
"In this article, we show -- using a reasoning applicable to both the excitation spectrum in the chiral bag model and the hyperfine structure of diatomic molecules -- that the generic form of a non- abelian Berry potential appears in heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) and that the Berry potential vanishes for the soliton- heavy meson bound state in the heavy-quark limit. The vanishing of the Berry potential in HQET is shown to be related to the restoration of heavy-quark symmetry in infinite heavy-quark-mass limit in close analogy to diatomic molecules at infinite internuclear separation. "
"The time-frequency content of a signal can be measured by the Gabor transform or windowed Fourier transform. This is a function defined on phase space that is computed by taking the Fourier transform of the product of the signal against a translate of a fixed window. The problem of finding signals with Gabor transform that are maximally concentrated within a given region of phase space is discussed. It is well known that such problems give rise to an eigenvalue problem for an associated self-adjoint, positive {\em concentration} operator that has its spectrum contained in the unit interval. In this paper, the asymptotic behavior of these eigenvalues as the concentration region gets large is studied. The smoothness of the eigenfunctions is also examined. "
"We develop a field-theoretical approach to determination of the background target space fields corresponding to general $G/H$ coset conformal theories described by gauged WZW models. The basic idea is to identify the effective action of a gauged WZW theory with the effective action of a sigma model. The derivation of the quantum effective action in the gauged WZW theory is presented in detail, both in the bosonic and in the supersymmetric cases. We explain why and how one can truncate the effective action by omitting most of the non-local terms (thus providing a justification for some previous suggestions). The resulting metric, dilaton and the antisymmetric tensor are non-trivial functions of $1/k$ (or $\alpha'$) and represent a large class of conformal sigma models. The exact expressions for the fields in the sypersymmetric case are equal to the leading order (`semiclassical') bosonic expressions (with no shift of $k$). An explicit form in which we find the sigma model couplings makes it possible to prove that the metric and the dilaton are equivalent to the fields which are obtained in the operator approach, i.e. by identifying the $L_0$-operator of the conformal theory with a Klein-Gordon operator in a background. The metric can be considered as a `deformation' of an invariant metric on the coset space $G/H$ and the dilaton can be in general represented in terms of the logarithm of the ratio of the determinants of the `deformed' and `round' metrics. "
"Arp 299C is a $5 \times 10^{10}$ \Lsun infrared source in the merging galaxy system Arp 299. It is the most luminous object known that is not obviously associated with a galaxy nucleus. Our data show that the 8--13 \mum spectrum of Arp 299C has a strong \NeII emission line and emission features like those of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. These emission features are characteristic of \HII regions associated with a burst of star formation. We did not detect any high-excitation ionic lines characteristic of an active galactic nucleus, nor a deep silicate absorption feature that might indicate a hidden compact nucleus. We deduce that Arp 299C is powered by an intense burst of star formation. "
We study the U(M/N) supergroup keeping in mind its connection with electronic Hamiltonians. It is explicitly shown that the generators of the supergroup U(N/N) can be expressed by Clifford operators or Fermi operators. A multi-band supersymmetric electronic model is suggested. 
"This paper is mainly devoted to the following question:\ Let $M,N$ be von~Neumann algebras with $M\subset N$, if there is a completely bounded projection $P\colon \ N\to M$, is there automatically a contractive projection $\widetilde P\colon \ N\to M$? We give an affirmative answer with the only restriction that $M$ is assumed semi-finite. "
The staggered magnetization of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet in two dimensions can be systematically approximated by a 1/N expansion. Cancellation between self energy diagrams leads to a Luttinger-like theorem for the ground state. We prove (for a smooth enough self energy) that the long range order of mean field theory ($N$=$\infty$) survives corrections to all orders of 1/N. Divergences of this series provides a new route to the disordered phases of quantum antiferromagnets. 
"The form of the initial value constraints in Ashtekar's hamiltonian formulation of general relativity is recalled, and the problem of solving them is compared with that in the traditional metric variables. It is shown how the general solution of the four diffeomorphism constraints can be obtained algebraically provided the curvature is non-degenerate, and the form of the remaining (Gauss law) constraints is discussed. The method is extended to cover the case when matter is included, using an approach due to Thiemann. The application of the method to vacuum Bianchi models is given. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of alternative approaches to the initial value problem in the Ashtekar formulation. "
"The most general R-matrix type state sum model for link invariants is constructed. It contains in itself all R-matrix invariants and is a generating function for ""universal"" Vassiliev link invariants. This expression is more simple than Kontsevich's expression for the same quantity, because it is defined combinatorially and does not contain any integrals, except for an expression for ""the universal Drinfeld's associator"". "
"Charged scalar particles introduced in some extensions of the standard model can induce $\tau$ leptonic decay at tree level. We find that with some charged SU(2)-singlet scalar particles, like ones introduced in Zee-type models, $\tau$ leptonic decay width is always smaller than what is predicted by the standard model, therefore they may offer a natural solution to $\tau$ decay puzzle. To be more specific, we examine some Zee-type models in detail to see if at the same time they are acceptable in particle physics, cosmology and astrophysics. It is shown that $\tau$ decay data do put some constrains on these models. "
"This paper is based on a talk given by A R Liddle at the PASCOS/TEXAS meeting in December 1992, and will appear in the proceedings. The central result is that all known models of inflation which end in a first order phase transition can be ruled out by combining galaxy surveys at a few tens of Mpc with the COBE data (including the effect of gravitational waves). This conclusion is based on the work described in A R Liddle and D H Lyth, Phys Lett B 291 (1992) 391. "
"We generalize some of the standard homological techniques to $\cW$-algebras, and compute the semi-infinite cohomology of the $\cW_3$ algebra on a variety of modules. These computations provide physical states in $\cW_3$ gravity coupled to $\cW_3$ minimal models and to two free scalar fields. "
"In the minimal supersymmetric standard model, the Higgs sector has two unknown parameters, usually taken to be $\tan \beta \equiv v_2/v_1$ and $m_A$, the mass of its one physical pseudoscalar particle. By minimizing the minimum of the Higgs potential along a certain direction in parameter space, it is shown that $m_A = M_Z$ + radiative correction, and if one further plausible assumption is made, $\tan \beta > \sqrt 3$. "
"The renormalization functions involved in the determination of the topological susceptibility in the SU(2) lattice gauge theory are extracted by direct measurements, without relying on perturbation theory. The determination exploits the phenomenon of critical slowing down to allow the separation of perturbative and non-perturbative effects. The results are in good agreement with perturbative computations. "

"We discuss the appearance of time-asymmetric behavior in physical processes in cosmology and in the dynamics of the Universe itself. We begin with an analysis of the nature and origin of irreversibility in well-known physical processes such as dispersion, diffusion, dissipation and mixing, and make the distinction between processes whose irreversibility arises from the stipulation of special initial conditions, and those arising from the system's interaction with a coarse-grained environment. We then study the irreversibility associated with quantum fluctuations in cosmological processes like particle creation and the `birth of the Universe'. We suggest that the backreaction effect of such quantum processes can be understood as the manifestation of a fluctuation-dissipation relation relating fluctuations of quantum fields to dissipations in the dynamics of spacetime. For the same reason it is shown that dissipation is bound to appear in the dynamics of minisuperspace cosmologies. This provides a natural course for the emergence of a cosmological and thermodynamic arrow of time and suggests a meaningful definition of gravitational entropy. We conclude with a discussion on the criteria for the choice of coarse-grainings and the stability of persistent physical structures. Invited Talk given at the Conference on The Physical Origin of Time-Asymmetry Huelva, Spain, Oct. 1991, Proceedings eds. J. J. Halliwell, J. Perez-Mercader and W. H. Zurek, Cambridge University Press, 1993 "
We consider the $P$- and $Q$-shape parameters in the eigenphase and `bar' phase shift representations for the two Reid potentials and the more recent Moscow potential. The values of these parameters were obtained from integrals of the zero-energy wave function in a similar manner to that for the effective range. Such expressions for the shape parameters yield more reliable numerical values of the shape parameter than those obtained by least-mean-square or polynomial fits. We show that the eigenphase representation is more meaningful than the `bar' phase shift representation and that the variation in the values of $P_\alpha$ in the models may be of significance. 
"An equal time version of odd-frequency pairing for a generalized $t-J$ model is introduced. It is shown that the composite operators describing binding of Cooper pairs with magnetization fluctuations naturally appear in this approach. The pairing correlations in both BCS and odd-frequency channels are investigated exactly in 1D systems with up to 16 sites. Our results indicate that at some range of parameters odd-frequency correlations become comparable, however smaller than BCS pairing correlations. It is speculated that the spin and density fluctuations in the frustrated model lead to the enhancement of the odd gap susceptibilities. 4 postscript figure files are attached at the bottom of the tex file. "
"In this paper we develop the covariant string field theory approach to open 2d strings. Upon constructing the vertices, we apply the formalism to calculate the lowest order contributions to the 4- and 5- point tachyon--tachyon tree amplitudes. Our results are shown to match the `bulk' amplitude calculations of Bershadsky and Kutasov. In the present approach the pole structure of the amplitudes becomes manifest and their origin as coming from the higher string modes transparent. "
"It is well known that if phases and masses in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) are allowed to have general values, the resulting neutron EDM ($d_n$) exceeds the experimental upper limit by about $10^3$. We assume that the needed suppression is not due to a fine-tuning of phases or masses, and ask what natural size of $CP$ violation (CPV) results. We show that (1) the phase of one of the superpotential parameters, $\mu$, does not contribute to any CPV in the MSSM and so is not constrained by \dn; (2) the MSSM contribution to $d_n$ is tiny, just coming from the CKM phase; (3) the phases in the MSSM cannot be used to generate a baryon asymmetry at the weak scale, given our assumptions; and (4) in non-minimal SUSY models, an effective phase can enter at one loop giving $d_n \sim 10^{-26}$\ecm, $d_e \sim 10^{-27}$\ecm, and allowing a baryon asymmetry to be generated at the weak scale, without fine-tunings. Our results could be evaded by a SUSY breaking mechanism which produced phases for the SUSY breaking parameters that somehow were naturally of order $10^{-3}$. "
"We present the one-loop helicity amplitudes with five external gluons. The computation employs string-based methods, new techniques for performing tensor integrals, and improvements in the spinor helicity method. "
"QCD radiative correction to Higgs $\rightarrow$ two photons decay rate is calculated. Below the threshold we found negligible correction, thus supporting results obtained earlier by Djouadi et all [7]. Above the threshold radiative correction appears to be large for both real and imaginary part of H $\gamma \gamma$ vertex. This leads to radiative correction for $\Gamma $(H $\rightarrow \gamma \gamma $) to be of order 20--100 percents at $m_{t}=150 GeV$. Possible applications of our results for Higgs search at Next Linear Colliders (NLC) are briefly discussed. "
"We study the effect of fluctuations in the vicinity of an Eckhaus instability. The classical stability limit, which is defined in the absence of fluctuations, is smeared out into a region in which fluctuations and nonlinearities dominate the decay of unstable states. The width of this region is shown to grow as $ D^{1/2} $, where $D$ is the intensity of the fluctuations. We find an effective stability boundary that depends on $D$. A numerical solution of the stochastic Swift-Hohenberg equation in one dimension is used to test this prediction and to study pattern selection when the initial unstable state lies within the fluctuation dominated region. The asymptotically selected state differs from the predictions of previous analyses. Finally, the nonlinear relaxation for $D > 0$ is shown to exhibit a scaling form. "
"We trace the development of ideas on dissipative processes in chaotic cosmology and on minisuperspace quantum cosmology from the time Misner proposed them to current research. We show 1) how the effect of quantum processes like particle creation in the early universe can address the issues of the isotropy and homogeneity of the observed universe, 2) how viewing minisuperspace as a quantum open system can address the issue of the validity of such approximations customarily adopted in quantum cosmology, and 3) how invoking statistical processes like decoherence and correlation when considered together can help to establish a theory of quantum fields in curved spacetime as the semiclassical limit of quantum gravity. {\it Dedicated to Professor Misner on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday, June 1992.} To appear in the Proceedings of a Symposium on {\it Directions in General Relativity}, College Park, May 1993, Volume 1, edited by B.

"It is shown that the quantum position operator of Newton and Wigner for non-zero mass systems is uniquely determined if one imposes a quantum ''manifest covariance'' condition of the same type as the similar condition of Currie, Jordan and Sudarshan in the the framework of the Hamiltonian formalism. "
"We consider the energy level statistics of non-interacting electrons which diffuse in a $ d $-dimensional disordered metallic conductor of characteristic Thouless energy $ E_c. $ We assume that the level distribution can be written as the Gibbs distribution of a classical one-dimensional gas of fictitious particles with a pairwise additive interaction potential $ f(\varepsilon ). $ We show that the interaction which is consistent with the known correlation function of pairs of energy levels is a logarithmic repulsion for level separations $ \varepsilon <E_c, $ in agreement with Random Matrix Theory. When $ \varepsilon >E_c, $ $ f(\varepsilon ) $ vanishes as a power law in $ \varepsilon /E_c $ with exponents $ -{1 \over 2},-2, $ and $ -{3 \over 2} $ for $ d=1,2, $ and 3, respectively. While for $ d=1,2 $ the energy-level interaction is always repulsive, in three dimensions there is long-range level attraction after the short-range logarithmic repulsion. "
"We determine the structure of the partition algebra $P_n(Q)$ (a generalized Temperley-Lieb algebra) for specific values of $Q \in \C$, focusing on the quotient which gives rise to the partition function of $n$ site $Q$-state Potts models (in the continuous $Q$ formulation) in arbitrarily high lattice dimensions (the mean field case). The algebra is non-semi-simple iff $Q$ is a non-negative integer less than $n$. We determine the dimension of the key irreducible representation in every specialization. "
"Following Hawking, it is usual to mimic the effect of collapse space-time geometry on quantum fields in a semi-classical approximation by imposing suitable boundary conditions at the origin of coordinates, which effectively becomes a moving mirror. Suitable mirror trajectories induces a close analogue to the radiance of black holes, including a flux of outgoing radiation that appears accurately thermal. If the acceleration of the mirror eventually ceases the complete state of the radiation field is a pure quantum state, even though it is indistinguishable from an accurately thermal state for an arbitrarily long period of time and in a precise sense differs little from ``pure thermal'' closely followed by ``vacuum''. Suspicions that the semiclassical calculation of black hole radiance gives evidence for the evolution of pure into mixed states are criticized on this basis. Possible extensions of the model to mimic black holes more accurately (including the effects of back reaction and partial transparency), while remaining within the realm of tractable models, are suggested. "
We prove in this paper that the elliptic $R$--matrix of the eight vertex free fermion model is the intertwiner $R$--matrix of a quantum deformed Clifford--Hopf algebra. This algebra is constructed by affinization of a quantum Hopf deformation of the Clifford algebra. 
"Levinson's theorem for the Dirac equation is known in the form of a sum of positive and negative energy phase shifts at zero momentum related to the total number of bound states. In this letter we prove a stronger version of Levinson's theorem valid for positive and negative energy phase shifts separately. The surprising result is, that in general the phase shifts for each sign of the energy do not give the number of bound states with the same sign of the energy (in units of $\pi$), but instead, are related to the number of bound states of a certain Schr\""odinger equation, which coincides with the Dirac equation at zero momentum. "
The one electron spectral functions for the Luttinger model are discussed for large but finite systems. The methods presented allow a simple interpretation of the results. For finite range interactions interesting nonunivesal spectral features emerge for momenta which differ from the Fermi points by the order of the inverse interaction range or more. For a simplified model with interactions only within the branches of right and left moving electrons analytical expressions for the spectral function are presented which allows to perform the thermodynamic limit. As in the general spinless model and the model including spin for which we present mainly numerical results the spectral functions do not approach the noninteracting limit for large momenta. The implication of our results for recent high resolution photoemission measurements on quasi one-dimensional conductors are discussed. 
"Using a geometric definition for the lattice Chern-Simons term in even dimensions, we have studied the distribution of Chern-Simons numbers for the 2d-U(1) and the 4d-SU(2) lattice Higgs models. The periodic structure of the distributions is preserved in our lattice formulation and has been examined in detail. In both cases the finite size effects visible in the distribution of Chern-Simons numbers are well accounted for by the Haar measure. Moreover, we find that $\langle N_{CS}^2 \rangle$ grows with the spatial volume. We also find numerical evidence that tunneling in 4d is increased at high temperature.

"We consider two-state (q^2=-1) and three-state (q^3=1) one-dimensional quantum spin chains with U_q(SL(2)) symmetry. Taking unrestricted representations (periodic, semi-periodic and nilpotent), we show which are the necessary conditions to obtain a Hermitian Hamiltonian. "
"The purpose of these lectures is to discuss in some detail a new, non-perturbative approach to quantum gravity. I would like to present the basic ideas, outline the key results that have been obtained so far and indicate where we are headed and what the hopes are. The audience at this summer school had a diverse background; many came from high energy physics, some from mathematical physics and the rest from general relativity. Therefore, I have tried to keep the technicalities --particularly proofs and even the number of equations-- to a minimum. My hope is that a research student in any of these three fields should be able to get a bird's eye view of the entire program. In particular, I have kept all three perspectives in mind while discussing the difficulties one encounters and strategies one adopts and in evaluating the successes and limitations of the program. "
"Brill waves are the simplest (non-trivial) solutions to the vacuum constraints of general relativity. They are also rich enough in structure to allow us believe that they capture, at least in part, the generic properties of solutions of the Einstein equations. As such, they deserve the closest attention. This article illustrates this point by showing how Brill waves can be used to investigate the structure of conformal superspace. This article is written as a contribution to the Dieter Brill Festschrift. "
A many-particle Hamiltonian is proposed in order to explain the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) for fractional filling factors $\nu < 1$. The solutions of the corresponding Hartree-Fock equations make it possible to discuss the FQHE from the point of view of the single quasi-particle energy spectrum. It is shown how the specific couplings in the many-particle Hamiltonian depend on the magnetic field and the area density of electrons. The degeneracies of the quasi-particle states are related to the fractional filling factors $\nu$. It is suggested that the energy gaps obtained in the quasi-particle energy spectrum are comparable with the experimentally measured quantities. An explicit calculation for the FQH - conductance is given and its character as a topological invariant is discussed. 
"We calculate the average persistent current in a mesoscopic metal ring threaded by a magnetic flux in the diffusive regime. It is shown that the classical electromagnetic energy leads to a {\it{universal}} average current of the order of $ \alpha e c / C_{0}$, where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant, $-e$ is the charge of the electron, $c$ is the velocity of light, and $C_{0}$ is the classical capacitance of the ring. Striking similarities between persistent currents and universal conductance fluctuations are discovered. We suggest a simple experiment to test our theory. "
We analise the implications of the measurement of $B$ and $J/\psi$ inclusive \pt\ distributions performed in $p\bar p$ collisions by the UA1 and CDF experiments. 
Symmetric gauge fields and invariant metrics in homogeneous spaces are found. Their use for finding exact solutions of the Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) equations is discussed. 
"The algebraic formulation of the quantum group gauge models in the framework of the $R$-matrix approach to the theory of quantum groups is given. We consider gauge groups taking values in the quantum groups and noncommutative gauge fields transformed as comodules under the coaction of the gauge quantum group $ G_{q}$. Using this approach we construct the quantum deformations of the topological Chern-Simons models, non-abelian gauge theories and the Einstein gravity. The noncommutative fields in these models generate $ G_{q}$-covariant quantum algebras. "
"Recently it has been suggested that top quarks, or very massive fourth generation quarks, might surround themselves with a Higgs ""bag"" of deformation of the Higgs expectation value from its vacuum magnitude. In this paper we address the question of whether such nonlinear Higgs-top interaction effects are subject to experimental test. We first note that if top quarks were necessarily accompanied by Higgs ""bags"", then top quark weak decay would involve the sudden disruption of the Higgs ""bag"", with copious production of physical Higgs particles accompanying the decay. We then examine the effects that such Higgs ""bags"" would produce on the spectrum of toponium, where the two bound top (anti)quarks, and their ""bags"", overlap. We numerically evaluate the effects that the nonlinear feedback in the Higgs-toponium system would have on the energy level splittings of the toponium bound states, and find that for allowed values of the top and Higgs mass the effect is negligible, thus indicating that even in this favourable circumstance Higgs ""bag"" formation around top quarks does not observably occur. Finally, we consider the case of a second Higgs doublet, allowing the possibility of enhanced couplings for one of the physical Higgs to top. Even in this nonstandard scenario the effects are minimal, and we infer the general absence of observable effects at any level that might suggest the utility of considering top quarks to be accompanied by Higgs ""bags"". "
"Numerical minimization of the Euclidean action of the two-dimensional Abelian Higgs model is used to construct periodic instantons, the euclidean field configurations with two turning points describing transitions between the vicinities of topologically distinct vacua. Periodic instantons are found at any energy ( up to the sphaleron energy $E_{sph}$ ) and for wide range of parameters of the theory. We obtain the dependence of the action and the energy of periodic instanton on its period; these quantities directly determine the probability of certain multiparticle scattering events. "
"A new topological invariant of closed connected orientable four-dimensional manifolds is proposed. The invariant, constructed via surgery on a special link, is a four-dimensional counterpart of the celebrated SU(2) three-manifold invariant of Reshetikhin, Turaev and Witten. "
"The $N=2$ fermionic string theory is revisited in light of its recently proposed equivalence to the non-compact $N=4$ fermionic string model. The issues of space-time Lorentz covariance and supersymmetry for the BRST quantized $N=2$ strings living in uncompactified $2 + 2$ dimensions are discussed. The equivalent local quantum supersymmetric field theory appears to be the most transparent way to represent the space-time symmetries of the extended fermionic strings and their interactions. Our considerations support the Siegel's ideas about the presence of $SO(2,2)$ Lorentz symmetry as well as at least one self-dual space-time supersymmetry in the theory of the $N=2(4)$ fermionic strings, though we do not have a compelling reason to argue about the necessity of the {\it maximal} space-time supersymmetry. The world-sheet arguments about the absence of all string massive modes in the physical spectrum, and the vanishing of all string-loop amplitudes in the Polyakov approach, are given on the basis of general consistency of the theory. "
"We study $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in small volumes and with twist $\vec{m}=(1,1,1)$. We investigate the presence of the periodic instantons of $Q=\frac{1}{2}$ and determine their free energy and their contribution to the splitting of energy flux sectors \mbox{$E(\vec{e}=(1,1,1))-E(\vec{e}=(0,0,0)) $.} "
"We determine the structure of two variations on the Temperley-Lieb algebra, both used for dealing with special kinds of boundary conditions in statistical mechanics models. The first is a new algebra, the `blob' algebra (the reason for the name will become obvious shortly!). We determine both the generic and all the exceptional structures for this two parameter algebra. The second is the periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra. The generic structure and part of the exceptional structure of this algebra have already been studied. Here we complete the analysis, using results from the study of the blob algebra. "
Observing the production of the Higgs particle in the $\gamma$-$\gamma$ mode of a linear $e^+e^-$ collider allows for the measurement of the $H\gamma\gamma$ coupling. We point out that for the intermediate Higgs mass range this measurement is considerably more challenging than previously believed. The $b \bar b$ signature receives a large background from the production of heavy quark pairs by resolved photons. We quantify the experimental requirements needed to make a meaningful measurement in the presence of this background. 
To cosmic rays incident near the horizon the Earth's atmosphere represents a beam dump with a slant depth reaching 36000~g~cm$^{-2}$ at $90^\circ$. The prompt decay of a heavy quark produced by very high energy cosmic ray showers will leave an unmistakable signature in this dump. We translate the failure of experiments to detect such a signal into an upper limit on the heavy quark hadroproduction cross section in the energy region beyond existing accelerators. Our results disfavor any rapid growth of the cross section or the gluon structure function beyond very conservative estimates based on perturbative QCD. 
"In this lecture a short introduction is given into the theory of the Feynman path integral in quantum mechanics. The general formulation in Riemann spaces will be given based on the Weyl- ordering prescription, respectively product ordering prescription, in the quantum Hamiltonian. Also, the theory of space-time transformations and separation of variables will be outlined. As elementary examples I discuss the usual harmonic oscillator, the radial harmonic oscillator, and the Coulomb potential. Lecture given at the graduate college ''Quantenfeldtheorie und deren Anwendung in der Elementarteilchen- und Festk\""orperphysik'', Universit\""at Leipzig, 16-26 November 1992. "
"Random sequential adsorption (RSA) models have been studied due to their relevance to deposition processes on surfaces. The depositing particles are represented by hard-core extended objects; they are not allowed to overlap. Numerical Monte Carlo studies and analytical considerations are reported for 1D and 2D models of multilayer adsorption processes. Deposition without screening is investigated, in certain models the density may actually increase away from the substrate. Analytical studies of the late stage coverage behavior show the crossover from exponential time dependence for the lattice case to the power law behavior in the continuum deposition. 2D lattice and continuum simulations rule out some ""exact"" conjectures for the jamming coverage. For the deposition of dimers on a 1D lattice with diffusional relaxation we find that the limiting coverage (100%) is approached according to the ~1/t**0.5 power-law preceded, for fast diffusion, by the mean-field crossover regime with the intermediate ~1/t behavior. In case of k-mer deposition (k>3) with diffusion the void fraction decreases according to the power-law t**[-1/(k-1)]. In the case of RSA of lattice hard squares in 2D with diffusional relaxation the approach to the full coverage is ~t**(-0.5). "
In this paper the explicit form of the operator of transformation of the vacuum states for the general two-mode Bogolubov transformation is found 
"A canonical transformation is performed on the phase space of a number of homogeneous cosmologies to simplify the form of the scalar (or, Hamiltonian) constraint. Using the new canonical coordinates, it is then easy to obtain explicit expressions of Dirac observables, i.e.\ phase space functions which commute weakly with the constraint. This, in turn, enables us to carry out a general quantization program to completion. We are also able to address the issue of time through ``deparametrization'' and discuss physical questions such as the fate of initial singularities in the quantum theory. We find that they persist in the quantum theory {\it inspite of the fact that the evolution is implemented by a 1-parameter family of unitary transformations}. Finally, certain of these models admit conditional symmetries which are explicit already prior to the canonical transformation. These can be used to pass to quantum theory following an independent avenue. The two quantum theories --based, respectively, on Dirac observables in the new canonical variables and conditional symmetries in the original ADM variables-- are compared and shown to be equivalent. "
"In several of the class A Bianchi models, minisuperspaces admit symmetries. It is pointed out that they can be used effectively to complete the Dirac quantization program. The resulting quantum theory provides a useful platform to investigate a number of conceptual and technical problems of quantum gravity. "
Using the Polyakov string ansatz for the rectangular Wilson loop we calculate the static potential in the semiclassical approximation. Our results lead to a well defined sum over surfaces in the range $1<d<25$. 
"We have calculated the decay $\tau \rightarrow \nu \pi(K) \gamma$. We present the photon energy spectrum, the meson-photon invariant mass spectrum and the integrated rate as a function of a photon energy cut or an invariant mass cut. Both the internal bremsstrahlung and the structure dependent radiation have been taken into account. To this aim we have parametrized the form factors $F_V$ and $F_A$, which determine the structure dependent radiation. Observables especially suited for the measurement of the structure dependent form factors are found and implications on the width of the $a_1$ discussed. "
We describe some recent progress in understanding and formulating string theory which is based on extensive studies of strings in lower (D=2) dimension. At the center is a large $W_{\infty}$ symmetry that appears most simply in the matrix model picture. In turn the symmetry defines the dynamics giving Ward identities and the complete S-matrix. The integrability aspect where nonlinear string phenomena emerges from linear matrix model dynamics is emphasized. Extensions involving couplings of discrete topological fields to the tachyon are also described. 
"We show how the concept of quantum open system and the methods in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics can be usefully applied to studies of quantum statistical processes in the early universe. We first sketch how noise, fluctuation, dissipation and decoherence processes arise in a wide range of cosmological problems. We then focus on the origin and nature of noise in quantum fields and spacetime dynamics. We introduce the concept of geometrodynamic noise and suggest a statistical mechanical definition of gravitational entropy. We end with a brief discussion of the theoretical appropriateness to view the physical universe as an open system. "
"The $O(\alpha m_t^2/m_w^2)$ and $O(\alpha \alpha_s m_t^2/m_w^2)$ corrections to the partial decay width $\Gamma(Z \rightarrow b + \bar{b})$ are computed using the current algebra formulation of radiative corrections. This framework allows one to easily enforce the relevant Ward identity that greatly simplifies the calculations. As a result, the one-loop $O(\alpha m_t^2/m_w^2)$ contribution is computed through the investigation of only two convergent diagrams. The computation of the QCD corrections to the one-loop $O(\alpha m_t^2/m_w^2)$ term involves fewer diagrams than in the standard approach. In particular, the number of infrared divergent contribution is reduced. The calculation is performed in the dimensional regularization scheme and no term more divergent than $\frac{1}{n-4}$ is found. Our result confirms the screening of the one-loop top mass effect recently found by Fleischer {\em et al.}. "
We establish a relationship between the modern theory of Yangians and the classical construction of the Gelfand-Zetlin bases for the complex Lie algebra $\gn$. Our approach allows us to produce the $q$-analogues of the Gelfand-Zetlin formulae in a straightforward way. 
"By simple arguments, we have shown that Karolyhazy's model overestimates the quantum uncertainty of the space-time geometry and leads to absurd physical consequences. The given model can thus not account for gradual violation of quantum coherence and can not predict tiny experimental effects either. "
"A new class of ``toy models'' for subaqueous bedform formation are proposed and examined. These models all show a similar mechanism of wavelength selection via bedform unification, and they may have applications to bedform stratigraphy. The models are also useful for exploring general issues of pattern formation and complexity in stochastically driven far from equilibrium systems. "
We study the stringy genus one partition function of $N=2$ SCFT's. It is shown how to compute this using an anomaly in decoupling of BRST trivial states from the partition function. A particular limit of this partition function yields the partition function of topological theory coupled to topological gravity. As an application we compute the number of holomorphic elliptic curves over certain Calabi-Yau manifolds including the quintic threefold. This may be viewed as the first application of mirror symmetry at the string quantum level. 
"The problem of information loss in black hole formation and the associated violations of basic laws of physics, such as conservation of energy, causality and unitarity, are avoided in the nonsymmetric gravitational theory, if the NGT charge of a black hole and its mass satisfy an inequality that does not violate any known experimental data and allows the existence of white dwarfs and neutron stars. "
"The q-commutation relations in the title are those that have recently received much attention, and that for -1<q<1 provide an interpolation between Bosonic and Fermionic statistics, passing through free statistics at q=0. We look at the C*-algebra R^q generated by the representation of these relations on the twisted Fock space of Bozejko-Speicher, and we find a canonical unitary U_q from the twisted Fock space to usual full Fock space, such that U_q R^q (U_q)^* contains the Cuntz algebra R^0, and such that we have equality for |q|<0.44. "
"In this paper we reconsider recently derived bounds on $MeV$ tau neutrinos, taking into account previously unaccounted for effects. We find that, assuming that the neutrino life-time is longer than $O(100~sec)$, the constraint $N_{eff}<3.6$ rules out $\nu_{\tau}$ masses in the range $0.5~(MeV)<m_{\nu_\tau}<35~(MeV)$ for Majorana neutrinos and $0.74~(MeV)<m_{\nu_\tau}<35~(MeV)$ for Dirac neutrinos. Given that the present laboratory bound is 35 MeV, our results lower the present bound to $0.5$ and $0.74$ for Majorana and Dirac neutrinos respectively. "
"This revised version corrects some substancial errors in the proofs. The old proofs were only valid for (finite dimensional) * (finite dimensional). The scope of the results remains the same, however for type I_\infty algebras, the results of the original version were incorrect. "
"We consider generalizations of the standard model (SM) which are based on the gauge symmetry $SU(n)_c\otimes SU(m)_L\otimes U(1)_N$. Although the most interesting possibilities occur when $n=3$, we will consider also the cases $n=4,5$ both with $m=3,4$. Models with left-right symmetry, horizontal symmetries and the possible embedding in a larger group (grand unification scenarios) are briefly discussed. "
"Methods and concepts for the study of phase transitions mediated by a time-dependent order-parameter field in curved spacetimes are discussed. A practical example is the derivation of an effective (quasi-)potential for the description of `slow-roll' inflation in the early universe. We first summarize our early results on viewing the symmetry behavior of constant background fields in curved but static spacetimes as finite size effect, and the use of derivative expansions for constructing effective actions for slowly-varying background fields. We then introduce the notion of dynamical finite size effect to explain how an exponential expansion of the scale factor imparts a finite size to the system and how the symmetry behavior in de Sitter space can be understood qualitatively in this light. We reason why the exponential inflation can be described equivalently by a scale transformation, thus rendering this special class of dynamics as effectively static. Finally we show how, in this view, one can treat the class of `slow-roll' inflation as a dynamic perturbation off the effectively static class of exponential inflation and understand it as a dynamical critical phenomenon in cosmology. "
"We consider the possibility that neutrinoless double beta decay may occur in models with unbroken lepton number via the emission of a massive gauge boson with electron lepton number $-2$. We determine the shape of the $\beta\,\beta$ sum energy spectrum as a function of the gauge coupling, independent of model-specific details. We discuss our results in light of the persistent experimental claims that excess events are observed near but below the spectrum endpoint of several elements. "
"Understanding the nontrivial features of light-front QCD is a central goal in current investigations of nonperturbative light-front field theory. We find that, with the choice of light-front gauge with antisymmetric boundary conditions for the field variables, the residual gauge freedom is fixed and the light-front QCD vacuum is trivial. The nontrivial structure in light-front QCD is determined by non-vanishing asymptotic physical (transverse) gauge fields at longitudinal infinity, which are responsible for nonzero topological winding number. "
"We discuss three classes of solitonic solutions in string theory: instantons, monopoles and string-like solitons. Instantons may provide a nonperturbative understanding of the vacuum structure of string theory, while monopoles may appear in string predictions for grand unification. The particular monopole solution shown has finite action as the result of the cancellation of gauge and gravitational singularities, a feature, which if it survives quantization, may yield insight into the structure of string theory as a finite theory of quantum gravity. In $D=10$, both monopoles and instantons possess fivebrane structure. The string-like solitons represent extended states of fundamental strings.( Talk given at INFN Eloisatron Project: 26th Workshop: ``From Superstrings to Supergravity'', Erice, Italy, Dec. 5-12, 1992.) "
"A detailed study is made of super elliptic curves, namely super Riemann surfaces of genus one considered as algebraic varieties, particularly their relation with their Picard groups. This is the simplest setting in which to study the geometric consequences of the fact that certain cohomology groups of super Riemann surfaces are not freely generated modules. The divisor theory of Rosly, Schwarz, and Voronov gives a map from a supertorus to its Picard group, but this map is a projection, not an isomorphism as it is for ordinary tori. The geometric realization of the addition law on Pic via intersections of the supertorus with superlines in projective space is described. The isomorphisms of Pic with the Jacobian and the divisor class group are verified. All possible isogenies, or surjective holomorphic maps between supertori, are determined and shown to induce homomorphisms of the Picard groups. Finally, the solutions to the new super Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (super KP) hierarchy of Mulase-Rabin which arise from super elliptic curves via the Krichever construction are exhibited. "
"In models of oriented closed strings, anomaly cancellations are deeply linked to the {\it modular invariance} of the torus amplitude. If open and/or unoriented strings are allowed, there are no non-trivial modular transformations in the additional genus-one amplitudes (Klein bottle, annulus and M\""obius strip). As originally recognized by Green and Schwarz, in the ten-dimensional type-I superstring the anomaly cancellation results from a delicate interplay between the contributions of these additional surfaces. In lower-dimensional models, the possible presence of a number of antisymmetric tensors yields a generalization of the Green-Schwarz mechanism. I illustrate these results by referring to some six-dimensional chiral models, and I conclude by addressing the additional difficulties that one meets when trying to extend the construction to chiral four-dimensional models. (Contribution to ''From Superstrings to Supergravity'', Erice, ITALY, december 5-12, 1992) "
"We scrutize the commonly used criteria for classicality and examine their underlying issues. The two major issues we address here are that of decoherence and fluctuations. We borrow the insights gained in the study of the semiclassical limit of quantum cosmology to discuss the three criteria of classicality for a quantum closed system: adiabaticity, correlation and decoherence. We then use the Brownian model as a paradigm of quantum open systems to discuss the relation of quantum and thermal fluctuations and their role in the transition from quantum to classical. We derive the uncertainty relation at finite temperature. We study how the fluctuations of a quantum system evolve after it is brought in contact with a heat bath and analyse the decoherence and relaxation processes. From the effect of fluctuations on decoherence we show the relation between these two sets of criteria of classicality. Finally, we briefly comment on the issue of nonintegrability in quantum open systems. "
"In gauge theories with slowly-running coupling constants, it may be possible for four-fermion operators to be nearly marginal. Such operators can possess asymptotically weak couplings, and can plausibly give rise to light composite vector mesons. "
"When a series of measurements is performed with increasingly coarse (or increasingly fine) precision, consecutive observations seem to be erratically distributed at first, and then organize themselves into cycles and patterns. The patterns, which arise because of roundoff errors, are related to a notion in number theory, the so- called Farey sequence. Key words: roundoff-error, number theory, Farey sequence. "
"The quantum theory of the spherically symmetric gravity in 3+1 dimensions is investigated. The functional measures are explicitly evaluated and the physical state conditions are derived by using the technique developed in two dimensional quantum gravity. Then the new features which are not seen in ADM formalism come out. If $\kappa_s > 0 $, where $\kappa_s =(N-27)/12\pi $ and $N$ is the number of matter fields, a singularity appears, while for $\kappa_s <0$ the singularity disappears. The quantum dynamics of black hole seems to be changed by the sign of $\kappa_s $. (Talk given by K.H. at Workshop on General Relativity and Gravity, Waseda, Tokyo, Japan, 18-20 Jan 1993.) "
An exact solution is presented for a swinging Atwood's machine. This teardrop-heart orbit is constructed using Hamilton-Jacobi theory. The example nicely illustrates the utility of the Hamilton-Jacobi method for finding solutions to nonlinear mechanical systems when more elementary techniques fail. 
"If high mass di-gamma events observed at LEP are due to the production of a di-gamma resonance via its leptonic coupling, its consequences can be observed at TRISTAN. We find that a predicted $Z$ decay branching rate is too small to account for the observed events if the resonance spin is zero, due to a strong cancellation in the decay amplitudes. Such a cancellation is absent if the resonance has a spin two. We study the consequences of a tensor production in the processes $e^+e^- \to e^+e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^-$ and $\gamma\,\gamma$ at TRISTAN energies. Complete helicity amplitudes with tensor boson exchange contributions are given, and the signal can clearly be identified from various distributions. TRISTAN experiments are also sensitive to the virtual tensor boson exchange effects, which reduce to the contact interaction terms in the high mass limit. "
"Previous studies of high-energy scattering in QCD have shown a remarkable correspondence with two-dimensional field theory. In this paper we formulate a simple effective model in which this two-dimensional nature of the interactions is manifest. Starting from the (3+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills action, we implement the high energy limit $s\! >\! > \! t$ via a scaling argument and we derive from this a simplified effective theory. This effective theory is still (3+1)-dimensional, but we show that its interactions can to leading order be summarized in terms of a two-dimensional sigma-model defined on the transverse plane. Finally, we verify that our formulation is consistent with known perturbative results. This is a revised and extended version of hep-th 9302104. In particular, we have added a section that clarifies the connection with Lipatov's gluon emission vertex. "
"We calculate the correction to $\qbq\to\tbt$ of order $\gmm$. This correction, proportional to the square of the Higgs-boson Yukawa coupling to the top quark, arises from loops of Higgs bosons and the scalar component of virtual vector bosons. The Yukawa correction to the total \tbt\ production cross section at the Fermilab Tevatron in the standard Higgs model is found to be much less than the theoretical uncertainty in the cross section. However, in a two-Higgs-doublet model, Yukawa couplings are generally enhanced. The Yukawa correction can increase the total $t\bar t$ production cross section in this model by as much as $20$-$35\%$, which is potentially observable at the Tevatron. "
"The master equation describing non-equilibrium one-dimensional problems like diffusion limited reactions or critical dynamics of classical spin systems can be written as a Schr\""odinger equation in which the wave function is the probability distribution and the Hamiltonian is that of a quantum chain with nearest neighbor interactions. Since many one-dimensional quantum chains are integrable, this opens a new field of applications. At the same time physical intuition and probabilistic methods bring new insight into the understanding of the properties of quantum chains. A simple example is the asymmetric diffusion of several species of particles which leads naturally to Hecke algebras and $q$-deformed quantum groups. Many other examples are given. Several relevant technical aspects like critical exponents, correlation functions and finite-size scaling are also discussed in detail. "
"We calculate the subprocess q qbar --> t tbar H which contributes to the signal for detection of a light `intermediate mass' Higgs boson at the LHC and SSC in the isolated lepton and two isolated photons mode. This enhances the gg --> t tbar H signal by about 10% at the SSC and 25% at the LHC. We also calculate the q qbar --> t tbar gamma gamma irreducible background subprocess to this detection mode which enhances the gg --> t tbar gamma gamma irreducible background. This background is found to be quite substantial due to the effect of radiation from the initial state quarks as well as the final state t tbar pair; at the SSC the q qbar initial state background enhances the gg initial state background by between 20% for m_t=100 GeV and 35% for m_t=180 GeV, and at the LHC by between 50% for m_t=100 GeV and 120% for m_t=180 GeV. However with a 3% mass resolution on the gamma gamma mass the extra q qbar background events are typically smaller than the extra q qbar signal events, and the signal remains observable. "
We show how the two-body potential may be uniquely determined from n-body spectra where the hypercentral approximation is valid. We illustrate this by considering an harmonic oscillator potential which has been altered by changing the energy or normalisation constant of the ground state of the n-body system and finding how this modifies the two-body potential. It is shown that with increasing number of particles the spectrum must be known more precisely to obtain the two-body potential to the same degree of accuracy. 
"The subgap conductivity of a normal-superconductor (NS) tunnel junction is thought to be due to tunneling of two electrons. There is a strong interference between these two electrons, originating from the spatial phase coherence in the normal metal at a mesoscopic length scale and the intrinsic coherence of the superconductor. We evaluated the interference effect on the transport through an NS junction. We propose the layouts to observe drastic Aharonov-Bohm and Josephson effects. "
"The amplitude and spectrum of the scalar and tensor perturbations depend upon the shape of the inflationary potential in the small interval where the scalar field responsible for inflation was between about 46 and 54 e-folds before the end of inflation. By expanding the inflationary potential in a Taylor series in this interval we show that the amplitude of the perturbations and the power-law slope of their spectra can be expressed in terms of the value of the potential 50 e-folds before the end of inflation, $V_{50}$, the steepness of the potential, $x_{50} \equiv \mpl V_{50}^\prime /V_{50}$, and the rate of change of the steepness, $x_{50}^\prime$ (prime denotes derivative with respect to the scalar field). "
"Estimates are made of the signals to be expected in the production of the exotic atoms Pionium ($\pi^+\pi^-$), Kaonium ($K^+K^-$) and also $K^+\pi^-$ in pp, pd and $e^+e^-$ reactions. Such experiments are now being undertaken or contemplated at CELSIUS, COSY, Indiana and SATURNE. "
"We present axion-dilaton black-hole and multi-black-hole solutions of the low-energy string effective action. Under $SL(2,R)$ electric-magnetic duality rotations only the ``hair"" (charges and asymptotic values of the fields) of our solutions is transformed. The functional form of the solutions is duality-invariant. Axion-dilaton black holes with zero entropy and zero area of the horizon form a family of stable particle-like objects, which we call {\it holons}. We study the quantization of the charges of these objects and its compatibility with duality symmetry. In general the spectrum of black-hole solutions with quantized charges is not invariant under $SL(2,R)$ but only under $SL(2,Z)$ or one of its subgroups $\Gamma_{l}$. Because of their transformation properties, the asymptotic value of the axion-dilaton field of a black hole may be associated with the modular parameter $\tau$ of some complex torus and the integer numbers $(n,m)$ that label its quantized electric and magnetic charges may be associated with winding numbers. "
"Let M be a compact complex surface which admits a Kaehler metric whose scalar curvature has integral zero; and suppose the fundamental group of M does not contain an Abelian subgroup of finite index. Then if M is blown up at sufficiently many points, the resulting surface M' admits scalar-flat Kaehler metrics. "
"A critical assessment of the available calculations of the top quark width is presented. QCD corrections, the finite mass of the $b$ quark and the effect of the $W$ width are included as well as the electroweak corrections. The relative importance of these corrections is demonstrated for the realistic range of top masses. For the QCD corrected decay rate we use the formulae from \cite{JK1} and include the electroweak correction taken from \cite{DS}. Our results differ from those available in the literature because all the later calculations ignored the effect of W width discussed earlier in \cite{JK1}~. This leads to an effect comparable in size to the electroweak correction. "
"We study the topology and geometry of those compact Riemannian (4n)-manifolds (M,g), n > 1, with positive scalar curvature and holonomy in Sp(n)Sp(1). Up to homothety, we show that there are only finitely many such manifolds of any dimension 4n. "
"By considering a set of $N$ anyonic oscillators ( non-local, intrinsic two-dimensional objects interpolating between fermionic and bosonic oscillators) on a two-dimensional lattice, we realize the $SU_q(N)$ quantum algebra by means of a generalized Schwinger construction. We find that the deformation parameter $q$ of the algebra is related to the anyonic statistical parameter $\nu$ by $q=exp({\rm i}\pi\nu)$. "
"The recent (p,n) polarization transfer experiments at LAMPF are explained in terms of a dropping rho-meson mass in the medium. "
"Intended for mathematical physicists interested in applications of the division algebras to physics, this article highlights some of their more elegant properties with connections to the theories of Galois fields and quadratic residues. "
"At low temperatures, the transport through a superconducting-normal tunnel interface is due to tunneling of electrons in pairs. The probability for this process is shown to depend on the layout of the electrodes near the tunnel junction, rather than on properties of the tunnel barrier. This dependence is due to interference of the electron waves on a space scale determined by the coherence length, either in the normal or the superconducting metal. The approach developed allows us to evaluate the subgap current for different layouts of interest. "
"Lectures given at the Trieste Summer School, 1992. These notes are an update of my review article ""Classical and Quantum W-Gravity"", preprint QMW-92-1, published in in ""Strings and Symmetries 1991"", with some extra material on W-geometry, W-symmetry in conformal field theory and W-strings. "

"We construct an effective Lagrangian which describes interactions of heavy and light hadrons utilizing the chiral flavor symmetry for light quarks and heavy quark symmetry. For both light and heavy sector we include pseudo scalars, vectors and baryons in the Lagrangian. Heavy hadron decays are discussed as application of our formalism. The $D_s$ decay constant and the coupling constant among heavy meson, heavy vector meson and light meson are fitted from the experimental data of $D^0 \rightarrow K^- e^+\nu_e$ decay. We also point out the possibility of model independent determination of $|V_{ub}|$ from $\Lambda_b \rightarrow p l \bar \nu$ decay. "
"Generalized symmetries of the Einstein equations are infinitesimal transformations of the spacetime metric that formally map solutions of the Einstein equations to other solutions. The infinitesimal generators of these symmetries are assumed to be local, \ie at a given spacetime point they are functions of the metric and an arbitrary but finite number of derivatives of the metric at the point. We classify all generalized symmetries of the vacuum Einstein equations in four spacetime dimensions and find that the only generalized symmetry transformations consist of: (i) constant scalings of the metric (ii) the infinitesimal action of generalized spacetime diffeomorphisms. Our results rule out a large class of possible ``observables'' for the gravitational field, and suggest that the vacuum Einstein equations are not integrable. "
"We generate artificial Lick maps using $N$--body simulations and compare the angular correlation function, $w(\vartheta)$, measured from the simulations with the APM correlation. For the Gaussian CDM model, neither the standard biassed model nor a more evolved model (as suggested by the COBE data), reproduce the correlations on large angular scales. We come to a similar conclusion about CDM models with positively skewed initial fluctuation distributions. In contrast, models with initially negatively skewed fluctuations produce a $w(\vartheta)$ that declines much more gently on large scales. Such models are therefore in principle capable of reconciling the lack of large--scale power of the CDM spectrum with the observed clustering of APM galaxies. "
"We present a spectral mapping theorem for semigroups on any Banach space $E$. From this, we obtain a characterization of exponential dichotomy for nonautonomous differential equations for $E$-valued functions. This characterization is given in terms of the spectrum of the generator of the semigroup of evolutionary operators. "
"We study the potential for using $e\gamma$\ collisions produced by backscattered laser photons to investigate WW$\gamma$\ couplings. We present results for Next Linear Collider energies of 500 GeV and 1 TeV. We find that where statistics allow, off W mass shell results can be quite important, complementing on W mass shell results from this and other studies. It is shown that $e\gamma$\ colliders would prove quite valuable in the investigations of W-boson physics. "
We calculate the entropy of a two-dimensional Fermi Liquid(FL) using a model with a contact interaction between fermions. We find that there are $T^2$ contributions to the entropy from interactions separate from those due to the collective modes. These $T^2$ contributions arise from non-analytic corrections to the real part of the self-energy which may be calculated from the leading log dependence of the imaginary part of the self-energy through the Kramers-Kronig relation. We find no evidence of a breakdown in Fermi Liquid theory in 2D and conclude that FL in 2D are similar to 3D FL's. 
"We study the occurrence of final states with only an electron-positron pair and missing transverse momentum as a signal of \susy\ in photon-photon collisions. Suitable high energy photon beams may be provided at linear colliders by back-scattering laser beams on electron beams. The final states considered represent a typical signature for the production and decay of selctron and chargino pairs within the \mssm. We show that, away from the kinematical threshold, selctrons produce this signal far more abundantly than charginos. The standard model background is dominated by W-pair production. We propose a series of kinematical cuts which reduce this background to an acceptable level. With a 1 TeV collider operated in the $\gamma\gamma$-mode, we find that interesting and complementary tests of \susic\ models can be performed for selctron masses up to 350 GeV. "
"Current correlators in QCD at a finite temperature $T$ are considered from the viewpoint of operator product expansion. It is stressed that at low $T$ the heat bath must be represented by hadronic, and not quark-gluon states. A possibility to express the results in terms of $T$-dependent resonance masses is discussed. It is demonstrated that in order $T^2$ the masses do not move and the only phenomenon which occurs is a parity and isospin mixing. "
"The rare $\pi^0 \to e^+e^-$ and $\eta \to \mu^+\mu^-$ decays are calculated in different schemes, which are seen to be essentially equivalent to and produce the same results as conventional Vector-Meson Dominance. We obtain the theoretical predictions $B(\pi^0 \to e^+e^-) = (6.41 \pm 0.19)\times 10^{-8}$ and $B(\eta \to \mu^+\mu^-) = (1.14 +0.06 -0.03) \times 10^{-5}$ in agreement with recent experimental data. "
"The recent experimental data on $D^{+}-D^{0}$ and $D^{\ast\, +}-D^{\ast\,0}$ mass differences are used as inputs in the QCD sum rules to obtain new estimates on the mass difference of light quarks and on the difference of their condensates: $m_d -m_u =3\pm 1\, MeV$, $\langle\bar{d}d\rangle -\langle\bar{u}u\rangle = -(2.5\pm 1)\cdot 10^{-3}\langle\bar{u}u\rangle$ (at a standard normalization point, $\mu = 0.5\, GeV$). "
"We perform a perturbative analysis of the Aharonov-Bohm problem to one loop in a field-theoretic formulation, and show that contact interactions are necessary for renormalizability. In general, the classical scale invariance of this problem is broken quantum mechanically. There exists however a critical point for which this anomaly disappears. "
"A general formalism for covariant $W_3$ string scattering is given. It is found necessary to use screening charges that are constructed from the $W_3$ fields including ghosts. The scattering amplitudes so constructed contain within them Ising model correlation functions and agree with those found previously by the authors. Using the screening charge and a picture changing operator, an infinite number of states in the cohomology of Q are generated from only three states. We conjecture that, apart from discrete states, these are all the states in the cohomology of Q. "
"Intertwined multiple Chern-Simons gauge fields induce matrix statistics among particles. We analyse this theory on a torus, focusing on the vacuum structure and the Hilbert space. The theory can be mimicked, although not completely, by an effective theory with one Chern-Simons gauge field. The correspondence between the Wilson line integrals, vacuum degeneracy and wave functions for these two theories are discussed. Further, it is obtained in both of these cases that the two total momenta and Hamiltonian commute only in the physical Hilbert space. "
"We perform a detailed investigation of the statistical properties of the projected distribution of galaxy clusters obtained in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models with both Gaussian and skewed primordial density fluctuations. We use N-body simulations to construct a set artificial Lick maps. An objective cluster--finding algorithm is used to identify clusters of different richness. For Gaussian models, the overall number of clusters is too small in the standard CDM case, but a model with higher normalisation fares much better; non--Gaussian models with negative skewness also fit faily well. We apply several statistical tests to compare real and simulated cluster samples, such as the 2-point correlation function, the minimal spanning tree construction, the multifractal analysis and the skewness of cell counts. The emerging picture is that Gaussian models, even with a higher normalization, are in trouble. Skew-positive models are also ruled out, while skew-negative models can reproduce the observed clustering of galaxy clusters in the CDM framework. "
"We have performed a QCD next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation for Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) retaining the full parton and hadron mass dependencies. We find that the gluon initiated contributions to DIS processes, such as charm production, are {\it comparable} in magnitude ({\it i.e.}, $30\%$ to $100\%$) to the ``leading-order'' (LO) sea-quark processes. The ``slow-rescaling"" prescription and the full NLO formalism are compared in a quantitative manner. The use of DIS distributions and the inclusion of the charm mass via slow-rescaling are not sufficient to mimic the correct NLO physics. These results imply that previous analyses of charm production data to extract the strange and charm content of the nucleon, as well as the precise determination of Standard Model parameters based on these analyses (such as the Weinberg angle), need to be reassessed. "
A statistical analysis of the spectrum of two particle - two hole doorway states in a finite nucleus is performed. On the unperturbed mean-field level sizable attractive correlations are present in such a spectrum. Including particle-hole rescattering effects via the residual interaction introduces repulsive dynamical correlations which generate the fluctuation properties characteristic of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble. This signals that the underlying dynamics becomes chaotic. This feature turns out to be independent of the detailed form of the residual interaction and hence reflects the generic nature of the fluctuations studied. 
The dilepton mass distribution from pre-equilibrium matter in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions is indistinguishable from a thermally produced distribution. 
"In the canonical light-front QCD, the elimination of unphysical gauge degrees of freedom leads to a set of boundary integrals which are associated with the light-front infrared singularity. We find that a consistent treatment of the boundary integrals leads to the cancellation of the light-front linear infrared divergences. For physical states, the requirement of finite energy density in the light-front gauge $(A_a^+=0)$ results in equations which determine the asymptotic behavior of the transverse (physical) gauge degrees of freedom at longitudinal infinity. These asymptotic fields are generated by the boundary integrals and they are responsible for the topological winding number. They also involve non-local behavior in the transverse direction that leads to non-local forces. "
"The contribution of Lorentz non-scalar operators to finite temperature correlation functions is discussed. Using the local duality approach for the one-pion matrix element of a product of two vector currents, the temperature dependence of the average gluonic stress tensor is estimated in the chiral limit to be $\langle{\bf E}^2 +{\bf B}^2\rangle_{T}=\frac{\pi^2}{10}bT^4$. At a normalization point $\mu=0.5$ GeV we obtain $b\approx 1.1$. Together with the known temperature dependence of the Lorentz scalar gluon condensate we are able to infer $\langle{\bf E}^2\rangle_T$ and $\langle{\bf B}^2\rangle_T$ separately in the low-temperature hadronic phase. "
"The equations of motion for the position and spin of a classical particle coupled to an external electromagnetic and gravitational potential are derived from an action principle. The constraints insuring a correct number of independent spin components are automatically satisfied. In general the spin is not Fermi-Walker transported nor does the position follow a geodesic, although the deviations are small for most situations. "
We present a method to find the number of real and imaginary observable parameters coming from the Yukawa sector in an arbitrary gauge theory. The method leads naturally to a classification of Yukawa couplings according to their symmetries and suggests a new parametrization of masses and mixings that is useful to study the behaviour of Yukawa couplings under the renormalization group. We apply it to some examples based on the Standard Model with Yukawa couplings obeying various chiral symmetries. We also show how our method of parameter counting can be used in some models with an enlarged leptonic sector. 
"The information content of the autocorrelation function (ACF) of intensity fluctuations of the X-ray background (XRB) is analyzed. The tight upper limits set by ROSAT deep survey data on the ACF at arcmin scales imply strong constraints on clustering properties of X-ray sources at cosmological distances and on their contribution to the soft XRB. If quasars have a clustering radius r_0=12-20 Mpc (H_0=50), and their two point correlation function, is constant in comoving coordinates as indicated by optical data, they cannot make up more 40-50% of the soft XRB (the maximum contribution may reach 80% in the case of stable clustering, epsilon=0). Active Star-forming (ASF) galaxies clustered like normal galaxies, with r_0=10-12 Mpc can yield up to 20% or up to 40% of the soft XRB for epsilon=-1.2 or epsilon=0, respectively. The ACF on degree scales essentially reflects the clustering properties of local sources and is proportional to their volume emissivity. The upper limits on scales of a few degrees imply that hard X-ray selected AGNs have r_0<25 Mpc if epsilon=0 or r_0<20 Mpc if epsilon=-1.2. No significant constraints are set on clustering of ASF galaxies, due to their low local volume emissivity. The possible signal on scales >6 deg, if real, may be due to AGNs with r_0=20 Mpc; the contribution from clusters of galaxies with r_0~50 Mpc is a factor 2 lower. "
"A unified treatment of high energy collisions in QCD is presented. Using a probabilistic approach, we incorporate both perturbative (hard) and non-perturbative (soft) components in a consistent fashion, leading to a ``Heterotic Pomeron"". As a Regge trajectory, it is nonlinear, approaching 1 in the limit $t\rightarrow -\infty$. "
"RSOS models based on the Lie algebras $B_m$, $C_m$ and $D_m$ are derived from the braiding of conformal field theory. This gives the first systematic derivation of these models earlier described by Jimbo et al. The general two field Boltzmann weights associated to any RCFT are described, giving in particular the off critical thermalized Boltzmann weights. Crossing properties are discussed and are shown to agree with the general theory which connects these with toroidal modular transformations. The soliton systems based on these lattice models are described and are conjectured based on the mass formulae and the spins of the integrals of motions to describe perturbations of the RCFT $G_k\times G_1\over G_{k+1}$, where $G$ is the corresponding Lie algebra. "
"In decays of the $Z^0$, the dominant mechanism for the direct production of charmonium states is the decay of the $Z^0$ into a charm quark or antiquark followed by its fragmentation into the charmonium state. We calculate the fragmentation functions describing the splitting of charm quarks into S-wave charmonium states to leading order in the QCD coupling constant. Leading logarithms of $M_Z/m_c$ are summed up using Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations. Our analytic result agrees with the complete leading order calculation of the rate for $Z^0 \rightarrow \psi c {\bar c}$. We also use our fragmentation functions to calculate the production rate of heavy quarkonium states in $W^\pm$, top quark, and Higgs decays. "
We derive a class of solutions to the string sigma-model equations for the closed bosonic string. The tachyon field is taken to form a constant condensate and the beta-function equations at one-loop level are solved for the evolution of the metric and the dilaton. The solutions represent critical string theories in arbitrary dimensions. The spectrum of the subclass of models with a linearly rising asymptotic dilaton is found using the Feigin-Fuks method. Certain approximate solutions arising in string field theory are used to illustrate the results explicitly. An argument based on conformal invariance leads to the conjecture that that stringy corrections to at least some singular spacetimes in general relativity result in non-singular metrics. We use the singularities of the big-bang/crunch type appearing in our models to examine this conjecture. 
"The minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model allows for some of the coupling strengths to be complex parameters. The presence of such imaginary phases can lead to violations of time reversal invariance, which can be tested if correlations in products of an odd number of polarizations and momenta are measured and found to be different from zero. As an example, we consider the triple product $\mbox{\bf J} \cdot \left(\mbox{\bf p}_1 \times \mbox{\bf p}_ {2} \right)$ in the $\beta$-decay of the neutron, of the $\Sigma^-$, and in the decay $K^{+}_{3\mu}$. For these low-energy decays, we find that the present experimental precision is not enough to provide useful bounds on combinations of such phases and the masses of the supersymmetric particles. At higher energies, the same time reversal violating correlation in the semileptonic decay of the $t$ quark is of the order of $\alpha_s/\pi$, made bigger by the large mass of the decaying quark. "
"We show that the construction of Ocneanu, which yields 1 for any 4D manifold, is not identical to our construction, which gives different numbers for different manifolds. "
We review the status of QCD tests in high energy p-pbar collisions. Contents: i) Introduction ii) QCD in Hadronic Collisions iii) Jet Production iv) Heavy Flavour Production v) W and Z Production vi) Direct Photons. 
"We investigate the evolution of the skewness of the distribution of density fluctuations in CDM models with both Gaussian and non--Gaussian initial fluctuations. We show that the method proposed by Coles \& Frenk (1991), which uses the skewness of galaxy counts to test the hypothesis of Gaussian primordial density fluctuations, is a potentially powerful probe of initial conditions. As expected, the mass distribution in models with initially non--Gaussian fluctuations shows systematic departures from the Gaussian behaviour on intermediate to large scales. We investigate the effect of peculiar velocity distortions and normalisation upon the relationship between skewness and variance. These effects are generally small for the models we consider. Comparing our results to the QDOT measurements of the skewness, we find that our initially positive--skew models are clearly excluded by this analysis, but the available data do not rule out the negative--skew models. "
"In simple models of the nuclear charge operator, measurements of the Coulomb sum and the charge form factor of a nucleus directly determine the proton-proton correlations. We examine experimental results obtained for few-body nuclei at Bates and Saclay using models of the charge operator that include both one- and two-body terms. Previous analyses using one-body terms only have failed to reproduce experimental results. However, we find that the same operators which have been used to successfully describe the charge form factors also produce substantial agreement with measurements of the Coulomb sum. "
A stationary subset $S$ of a regular uncountable cardinal $\kappa$ {\it reflects fully} at regular cardinals if for every stationary set $T \subseteq \kappa$ of higher order consisting of regular cardinals there exists an $\alpha \in T$ such that $S \cap \alpha$ is a stationary subset of $\alpha$. {\it Full Reflection} states that every stationary set reflects fully at regular cardinals. We will prove that under a slightly weaker assumption than $\kappa$ having Mitchell order $\kappa^{++}$ it is consistent that Full Reflection holds at every $\lambda \leq \kappa$ and $\kappa$ is measurable. 
"Making use of a recent result of Borchers, an algebraic version of the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem is given for conformal quantum field theories, i.e. the Tomita-Takesaki modular group associated with the von Neumann algebra of a wedge region and the vacuum vector concides with the evolution given by the rescaled pure Lorentz transformations preserving the wedge. A similar geometric description is valid for the algebras associated with double cones. Moreover essential duality holds on the Minkowski space $M$, and Haag duality for double cones holds provided the net of local algebras is extended to a pre-cosheaf on the superworld $\tilde M$, i.e. the universal covering of the Dirac-Weyl compactification of $M$. As a consequence a PCT symmetry exists for any algebraic conformal field theory in even space-time dimension. Analogous results hold for a Poincar\'e covariant theory provided the modular groups corresponding to wedge algebras have the expected geometrical meaning and the split property is satisfied. In particular the Poincar\'e representation is unique in this case. "
The proof of the non-renormalization theorem for the gauge anomaly of four-dimensional theories is extended to the case of models with a vanishing one-loop gauge beta function. 
"We show that the Hamiltonian $ h= H_{QED}+H_2$, where $H_{QED}$ is the spinor QED Hamiltonian and $H_2$ is the positive transversal photon mass term, is unbounded from below if the electromagnetic coupling constant $e^2$ is small enough, $e^2<e^2_0 $, and the transversal photon squared mass parameter $M^2$ is not too large: $0\leq M^2<e^2l^2c$, here, $l$ is the cut-off parameter, and $c$ and $e^2_0$, positive constants which do not depend on any parameters. "
"Throughout this abstract let U be a fixed p-point ultrafilter and let I be the dual ideal. Grigorieff forcing is P(U)={p:omega to 2|dom(p) is an element of I} ordered by reverse inclusion. It is well known that Grigorieff forcing is proper. The main result of this paper is the following: THEOREM: Gregorieff forcing does not satisfy Axiom A. To prove this we use the following game, denoted G(U), for two players playing alternatively: Player I plays a partition of omega, {J_n| n<omega}, such that for all n<omega, J_n is an element of I; At the nth turn Player II plays a finite subset F_n of J_n. Player II wins iff the union of the F_n is an element of U. The following two Lemmas prove the Theorem: LEMMA 1: If P(U) satisfies axiom A, then player II has a winning strategy in the game G(U). LEMMA 2:The game G(U) is undetermined. "
"A black hole solution to three dimensional general relativity with a negative cosmological constant has recently been found. We show that a slight modification of this solution yields an exact solution to string theory. This black hole is equivalent (under duality) to the previously discussed three dimensional black string solution. Since the black string is asymptotically flat and the black hole is asymptotically anti-de Sitter, this suggests that strings are not affected by a negative cosmological constant in three dimensions. "
"The extended phase space method of Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky is applied to formulate two dimensional gravity in a general class of gauges. A BRST formulation of the light-cone gauge is presented to reveal the relationship between the BRST symmetry and the origin of $SL(2,R)$ current algebra. From the same principle we derive the conformal gauge action suggested by David, Distler and Kawai. "
"We discuss two different methods of obtaining ``effective $2 \times 2$ Hamiltonians'' of the electromagnetic interaction which include relativistic corrections. One is the standard Foldy--Wouthuysen transformation which we compare with the Hamiltonian obtained from a direct reduction of the matrix element of the interaction Hamiltonian between positive--energy solutions of the free Dirac equation. The two approaches are applied to Compton scattering by a proton for which a low--energy theorem exists. It is found that the Foldy--Wouthuysen Hamiltonian yields the same result as a covariant calculation. This is not true for the direct reduction method which will in general lead to incorrect results even after restoring the gauge invariance property of the Hamiltonian. Furthermore, it is shown that an identification of the Z--diagrams of the usual Dirac representation with the contact graphs of the Foldy--Wouthuysen representation is incorrect beyond the order of the low--energy theorem. "
This is the revised version of an earlier paper with the same title. 
Clarified certain points and related it to other work. 
"We apply a recently developed method, multicanonical algorithm, to the problem of tertiary structure prediction of peptides and proteins. As a simple example to test the effectiveness of the algorithm, Met-enkephalin is studied and the ergodicity problem, or multiple-minima problem, is shown to be overcome by this algorithm. The lowest-energy conformation obtained agrees with that determined by other efficient methods such as Monte Carlo simulated annealing. The superiority of the present method to simulated annealing lies in the fact that the relationship to the canonical ensemble remains exactly controlled. Once the multicanonical parameters are determined, only one simulation run is necessary to obtain the lowest-energy conformation and furthermore the results of this one run can be used to calculate various thermodynamic quantities at any temperature. The latter point is demonstrated by the calculation of the average potential energy and specific heat as functions of temperature. "
"We have calculated part of O(${\alpha}_{S}$) QCD radiative correction to the total cross-section of top's threshold production in $ e^{+}e^{-} \to t\bar t \to W^{-} b W^{+} \bar b$ reaction. We found out a curious fact: there is no O(${\alpha}_{S}$) correction to the total cross-section, originated from $b \bar b , t \bar b ,\bar t b $ gluon exchange and corresponding gluon emission. Thus, all O(${\alpha}_{S}$) corrections which are non-zero, can be classified as: 1) corrections to $t \bar t$ nonrelativistic potential 2) corrections to the top's width 3) hard gluon correction to $\gamma t \bar t$-vertex. These corrections are well-known and were described in the previous papers. We can conclude that similar situation takes place for all unstable particles threshold production. This result can be expressed in the form of a general statment: There is no O(${\alpha}_{QED}$ or ${\alpha}_{QCD}$) corrections for the total cross-section , originated from the ""jet-jet"" interection. "
"We consider the process $K_L \ra \mu^\pm e^\mp \nu \overline{\nu}$ at next to leading order in chiral perturbation theory. This process occurs in the standard model at second order in the weak interaction and constitutes a potential background in searches for new physics through the modes $K_L \ra \mu^\pm e^\mp$. We find that the same cut, $M_{\mu e}>489$~MeV, used to remove the sequential decays $K_{l3}\ra \pi_{l2}$ pushes the $B(K_L \ra \mu^\pm e^\mp \nu \overline{\nu})$ to the $10^{-23}$ level, effectively removing it as a background. "
"Two different methods of obtaining ``effective $2\times 2$ Hamiltonians'' which include relativistic corrections to nonrelativistic calculations are discussed, the standard Foldy--Wouthuysen transformation and what we call the ``direct Pauli reduction''. We wish to investigate under which circumstances the two approaches yield the same result. Using a generic interaction with harmonic time dependence we show that differences in the corresponding effective S--matrices do arise beyond first--order perturbation theory. We attribute them to the fact that the use of the direct reduction effective Hamiltonian involves the additional approximation of neglecting contributions from the negative--energy intermediate states, an approximation which is unnecessary in the Foldy--Wouthuysen case as there the $4\times 4$ Hamiltonian does not connect positive-- and negative--energy states. We conclude that at least in the cases where the relativistic Hamiltonian is known, using the direct Pauli reduction effective Hamiltonian introduces spurious relativistic effects and therefore the Foldy--Wouthuysen reduction should be preferred. "
"The statistical precision of a chord method for estimating fractal dimension from a correlation integral is derived. The optimal chord length is determined, and a comparison is made to other estimators. These calculations use the approximation that all pairwise distances between the points are statistically independent; the adequacy of this approximation is assessed numerically. The chord method provides a very quick and easy dimension estimate which is only slightly less precise than the optimal estimator. Keywords: correlation dimension, statistical error "
"For every operator space $X$ the $C^\ast$-algebra containing it in a universal way is residually finite-dimensional (that is, has a separating family of finite-dimensional representations). In particular, the free $C^\ast$-algebra on any normed space so is. This is an extension of an earlier result by Goodearl and Menal, and our short proof is based on a criterion due to Exel and Loring. "
"In 2D conformal quantum field theory, we continue a systematic study of W-algebras with two and three generators and their highest weight representations focussing mainly on rational models. We review the known facts about rational models of W(2,\delta)-algebras. Our new rational models of W-algebras with two generators all belong to one of the known series. The majority of W-algebras with three generators -including the new ones constructed in this letter- can be explained as subalgebras or truncations of Casimir algebras. Nonetheless, for one solution of W(2,4,6) we reveal some features that do not fit into the pattern of Casimir algebras or orbifolds thereof. This shows that there are more W-algebras than those predicted from Casimir algebras (or Toda field theories). However, most of the known rational conformal field theories belong to the minimal series of some Casimir algebra. "
We discuss the possibility for the spectrum of topologically massive quantum electrodynamics with spinor matter fields to contain unexpected and unusual stable particle excitations for certain values of the topological photon mass. The new field theoretical phenomena arising from this novel spectral structure are briefly discussed. 
"We use Quantum Monte Carlo to evaluate the conductivity $\sigma$ of the 2--dimensional disordered boson Hubbard model at the superfluid-bose glass phase boundary. At the critical point for particle density $\rho=0.5$, we find $\sigma_{c}=(0.45 \pm 0.07) \sigma_{Q}$, where $\sigma_{Q}= e_{*}^{2} / h$ from a finite size scaling analysis of the superfluid density. We obtain $\sigma_{c}=(0.47 \pm 0.08) \sigma_{Q}$ from a direct calculation of the current--current correlation function. Simulations at the critical points for other particle densities, $\rho=0.75$ and $1.0$, give similar values for $\sigma$. We discuss possible origins of the difference in this value from that recently obtained by other numerical approaches. "
Ladders of field polynomial differential forms obeying systems of descent equations and corresponding to observables and anomalies of gauge theories are renormalized. They obey renormalized descent equations. Moreover they are shown to have vanishing anomalous dimensions. As an application a simple proof of the nonrenormalization theorem for the nonabelian gauge anomaly is given. 
"Bracket preserving gauge equivalence is established between several two-boson generated KP type of hierarchies. These KP hierarchies reduce under symplectic reduction (via Dirac constraints) to KdV, mKdV and Schwarzian KdV hierarchies. Under this reduction the gauge equivalence is taking form of the conventional Miura maps between the above KdV type of hierarchies. "
"We show that recent $\gamma$-ray observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud with EGRET rule out a universal cosmic ray flux only at energies below $\approx 10$ GeV, while the observed diffuse X-ray and $\gamma$-ray background radiations have already ruled out, by more than three orders of magnitude, a universal extragalactic cosmic ray flux identical to that observed in the local solar neighborhood at energies below $10^6$ GeV. "
"We consider the limitations of two techniques for detecting nonlinearity in time series. The first technique compares the original time series to an ensemble of surrogate time series that are constructed to mimic the linear properties of the original. The second technique compares the forecasting error of linear and nonlinear predictors. Both techniques are found to be problematic when the data has a long coherence time; they tend to indicate nonlinearity even for linear time series. We investigate the causes of these difficulties both analytically and with numerical experiments on ``real'' and computer-generated data. In particular, although we do see some initial evidence for nonlinear structure in the SFI dataset E, we are inclined to dismiss this evidence as an artifact of the long coherence time. "
"We present new estimates of the observed rates of SNe determined with the {\em control time} method applied to the files of observations of two long term, photographic SN searches carried out at the Asiago and Sternberg Observatories. Our calculations are applied to a galaxy sample extracted from RC3, in which 65 SNe have been discovered. This relatively large number of SNe has been redistributed in the different morphological classes of host galaxies giving the respective SN rates. The magnitude of two biases, the overexposure of the central part of galaxies and the inclination of the spiral parent galaxies, have been estimated. We show that due to overexposure a increasing fraction of SNe is lost in galaxies of increasing distances. Also, a reduced number of SNe is discovered in inclined galaxies ($i>30\degr$): SNII and Ib are more affected than Ia, as well as SNe in Sbc-Sd galaxies with respect to other spirals. We strengthen previous findings that the SN rates is proportional to the galaxy blue luminosity for all SN and Hubble types. Other sources of errors, besides those due to the statistics of the events, have been investigated. In particular those related to the adopted SN parameters (Cappellaro et al. (\cite{paper1})) and correction factor for overexposure and inclination. Moreover, we show that the frequencies of SNe per unit luminosity vary if different sources for the parameters of the sample galaxies are adopted, thus hampering the comparison of SN rates based on different galaxy samples. The overall rates per unit blue luminosity are similar to the previous "
"We study radiative corrections on $Zb{\bar b}$ vertex generated by the ETC gauge bosons, ``diagonal'' as well as sideways. Although the oblique corrections due to the ETC bosons are small in comparison with the oblique correction due to the technicolor dynamics, the non-oblique corrections result in substantial shift of contour plot in the $S$-$T$ plane. We show that such a shift due to the non-oblique corrections is actually important for discussing $S$ and $T$ values in the technicolor models. "
"We consider a class of $N=2$ supersymmetric non--unitary theories in two--dimensional Minkowski spacetime which admit classical solitonic solutions. We show how these models can be twisted into a topological sector whose energy--momentum tensor is a BRST commutator. There is an infinite number of degrees of freedom associated to the zero modes of the solitons. As explicit realizations of such models we discuss the BRST quantization of a system of free fields, while in the interacting case we study $N=2$ complexified twisted Toda theories. "
"We show that the harmonic Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin method of quantizing bosonic systems with second-class constraints or first-class holomorphic constraints extends to systems having both bosonic and fermionic second-class or first-class holomorphic constraints. Using a limit argument, we show that the harmonic BRST modified path integral reproduces the correct Senjanovic measure. "

We present results from simulations on two aspects of quark confinement in the pure gauge sector. First is the calculation of the profile of the flux tube connecting a static $q \bar{q}$ pair in $SU(2)$. By using the Michael sum rules as a constraint we give evidence that the energy density at the center of the flux tube goes to a constant as a function of quark separation. Slow variation of the width and energy density is not ruled out. Secondly in the confined phase of lattice $U(1)$ we calculate the curl of the magnetic monopole current and show that the dual London equation is satisfied and that the electric fluxoid is quantized. 
"We studied single $W$ boson production in high energy $e\gamma$ collisions and the sensitivity of various observables to the $WW\gamma$ gauge boson coupling. We evaluated the helicity amplitudes including the $W$ decay to final state fermions and all Feynman diagrams which give the same final state. At high energy, the non-resonant diagrams give significant contributions to the cross sections and should not be neglected. We first considered a $\sqrt{s}=120$~GeV $e^+e^-$ collider converted to an $e\gamma$ collider by backscattering a low energy laser off of one of the original electron beams. Such a collider could measure $\kappa_\gamma$ to $\simeq\pm 0.09$ at 95\% C.L. which is the same level of precision as could be achieved at LEP200 using $W$ pair production. We next considered single $W$ production at a 200 GeV $e^+e^-$ collider in the Weizacker-Williams approximation which can measure the $WW\gamma$ vertex independently of the $WWZ$ vertex. This process can measure $\kappa_\gamma$ to $\pm 0.15$ at 95\% C.L. which is comparable to the $W$ pair production process. Finally, we examined $W$ production at 500 GeV and 1 TeV $e^+e^-$ colliders, comparing results for photon spectra obtained from a backscattered laser and from beamstrahlung radiation. Here we found that the couplings could best be measured using the backscattered laser photons with $|\delta\kappa_\gamma|\leq 0.07$ and "
The predictions of SU(5) supergravity models with radiative breaking constrained by experimental proton decay bounds are discussed. It is shown that cosmological constraints further restrict the parameter space but can be satisfied for a wide range of parameters. It is also shown that no serious fine tuning problems (either at $M_{SUSY}$ or $M_{GUT}$) exist. 
"The similarity between tree-level string theory scalar amplitudes, the Koba-Nielsen form ($S^{1}$) and the Virasoro-Shapiro form ($S^{2}$) suggests a natural $S^{n}$ generalization for a scalar amplitude. It is shown that the $S^{n}$ amplitude shares many essential properties of the string theory amplitudes, including $SO(n+1,1)$ conformal symmetry and linear Regge trajectories for the mass spectrum. We also discuss factorization and the critical dimension for the amplitude, which are the necessary conditions for the quantum mechanical consistency (unitarity) of the amplitude. "
"We develop a transfer matrix formalism for two-dimensional pure gravity. By taking the continuum limit, we obtain a ""Hamiltonian formalism'' in which the geodesic distance plays the role of time. Applying this formalism, we obtain a universal function which describes the fractal structures of two dimensional quantum gravity in the continuum limit. "
"It is shown that the Lie algebra of the automorphic, meromorphic sl(2, C) -valued functions on a torus is a geometric realization of a certain infinite-dimensional finitely generated Lie algebra. In the trigonometric limit, when the modular parameter of the torus goes to zero, the former Lie algebra goes over into the sl(2,C) -valued loop algebra, while the latter one - into the Lie algebra (sl(2)^)'/(centre) . "
"Four-dimensional Euclidean spaces that solve Einstein's equations are interpreted as WKB approximations to wavefunctionals of quantum geometry. These spaces are represented graphically by suppressing inessential dimensions and drawing the resulting figures in perspective representation of three-dimensional space, some of them stereoscopically. The figures are also related to the physical interpretation of the corresponding quantum processes. "
"A multi--channel generalization of Doniach's Kondo necklace model is formulated, and its phase diagram studied in the mean--field approximation. Our intention is to introduce the possible simplest model which displays some of the features expected from the overscreened Kondo lattice. The $N$ conduction electron channels are represented by $N$ sets of pseudospins $\vt_{j}$, $j=1, ... , N$, which are all antiferromagnetically coupled to a periodic array of $|\vs|=1/2$ spins. Exploiting permutation symmetry in the channel index $j$ allows us to write down the self--consistency equation for general $N$. For $N>2$, we find that the critical temperature is rising with increasing Kondo interaction; we interpret this effect by pointing out that the Kondo coupling creates the composite pseudospin objects which undergo an ordering transition. The relevance of our findings to the underlying fermionic multi--channel problem is discussed. "
"We propose a lattice model to study the dynamics of a driven interface in a medium with random pinning forces. For driving forces F smaller than a threshold force F_c the whole interface gets pinned. The depinning transition can be characterized by a set of critical exponents: the static and dynamical roughness exponent, the velocity exponent defined by the scaling of the velocity of the interface with F-F_c, and a correlation length exponent. The critical exponents are determined numerically in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions. Our findings are compared with recent numerical and analytical results for a Langevin equation with quenched noise, which is expected to be in the same universality class. Our results support a recent functional renormalization group calculation by T.Nattermann et.al. (J.Phys.II France 2, 1483 (1992)). "
"A class of lattice gauge theories is presented which exhibits novel topological properties. The construction is in terms of compact Wilson variables defined on a simplicial complex which models a four dimensional manifold with boundary. The case of Z2 and Z3 gauge groups is considered in detail, and we prove that at certain discrete values of the coupling parameter, the partition function in these models remains invariant under subdivision of the underlying simplicial complex. A variety of extensions is also presented. "
A new way of solving the descent equations corresponding to the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions is presented. The method relies on the introduction of an operator $\delta$ which allows to decompose the exterior space-time derivative $d$ as a $BRS$ commutator. The case of the Yang-Mills theories is treated in detail. 
"We studied SU(2) flux distributions on four dimensional euclidean lattices with one dimension very large. By choosing the time direction appropriately we can study physics in two cases: one is finite volume in the zero temperature limit, another is finite temperature in the the intermediate to large volume limit. We found that for cases of beta > beta crit there is no intrinsic string formation. Our lattices with beta > beta crit belong to intermediate volume region, and the string tension in this region is due to finite volume effects. In large volumes we found evidence for intrinsic string formation. "
"A model of two--dimensional gravity with an action depending only on a linear connection is considered. This model is a topological one, in the sense that the classical action does not contain a metric or zweibein at all. A metric and an additional vector field are instead introduced in the process of solving equations of motion for the connection. They satisfy the constant curvature equation. It is shown that the general solution of these equations of motion can be described by using the space of orbits under the action of the Weyl group in the functional space containing all pairs formed by a metric and a vectorfield. It is shown also that this model admits an equivalent description by using a family of actions depending on the metric and the connection as independent variables. "
The quantum bialgebra related to the Baxter's eight-vertex R-matrix is found as a quantum deformation of the Lie algebra of sl(2)-valued automorphic functions on a complex torus. 
"The classical 2D cosmological model of Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger possesses a global symmetry that is responsible for decoupling of matter fields. The model is quantized on the basis of the extended phase space method to allow an exhaustive, algebraic analysis to find potential anomalies. Under a certain set of reasonable assumptions we show that neither the BRST symmetry of the theory nor the global symmetry suffers from an anomaly. From this we conclude that there is nothing to recognize the existence of black hole and therefore nothing to radiate in their cosmological model. "
The present status of the use of two-particle intensity interferometry as a diagnostic tool to study the space-time dynamics of intermediate energy heavy ion collisions is examined. Calculations for the two-proton and two-pion correlation functions are presented and compared to experiment. The calculations are based on the nuclear Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport theory. 
"We demonstrate the level crossing phenomenon for fermions in the background field of the sphaleron barrier, by numerically determining the fermion eigenvalues along the minimal energy path from one vacuum to another. We assume that the fermions of a doublet are degenerate in mass, allowing for spherically symmetric ans\""atze for all of the fields, when the mixing angle dependence is neglected. "
"It is shown that in the physically interesting domain of the parameter space of SU(5) supergravity GUT, the Higgs and the Z poles dominate the LSP annihilation. Here the naive analyses on thermal averaging breaks down and formulae are derived which give a rigorous treatment over the poles. These results are then used to show that there exist significant domains in the parameter space where the constraints of proton stability and cosmology are simultaneously satisfied. New upper limits on light particle masses are obtained. "
We construct the sphaleron for several temperature dependent effective potentials. We determine the sphaleron energy as a function of temperature and demonstrate that the sphaleron energy at a given temperature $T$ is well approximated by the sphaleron energy at temperature zero scaled by the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the Higgs field at temperatures $T$ and zero. We address the cosmological upper bound on the Higgs mass. 
"T-odd correlations of polarizations and momenta provide a promising testing ground for new physics beyond the standard model. We estimate the contribution of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model to two such observables: in the production of $t\bar{t}$, we look for a term proportional to \mbox{${\bf J}_t \cdot ({\bf p}_q \times {\bf p}_{t})$}-where {\bf J}$_t$ is the polarization of the $t$ quark and {\bf p} $_{q,t}$ are the momenta of the initial and final particles-and find that it is of the order of $10^{-1} \times (\alpha_s/\pi)$. In the production of $W^+W^-$, we look for a term proportional to \mbox{${\bf E}_W \cdot ({\bf p}_q \times {\bf p}_{W})({\bf p}_q \cdot {\bf E}_W)$}-where {\bf E}$_W$ is the transverse polarization of W- to find that it can be as large as $10^{-1} \times (\alpha_w/\pi)$. "
"We present models that can reconcile the solar and atmospheric neutrino data with the existence of a hot dark matter component in the universe. This dark matter is a quasi-Dirac neutrino whose mass $m_{DM}$ arises at the one-loop level. The solar neutrino deficit is explained via nonadiabatic conversions of electron neutrino to a sterile neutrino and the atmospheric neutrino data via maximal muon neutrino to tau neutrino oscillations generated by higher order loop diagrams. For $m_{DM} \sim 30$ eV the radiative neutrino decay can lead to photons that can ionize interstellar hydrogen. In one of the models one can have observable $\nu_e$ to $\nu_\tau$ oscillation rates, with no appreciable muon neutrino oscillations at accelerator experiments. In addition, there can be observable rates for tau number violating processes such as $\tau \to 3e$ and $\tau \to e + \gamma$. In the other model one can have sizeable $\nu_e$ to $\nu_\mu$ oscillation rates, as well as sizeable rates for muon number violating processes such as $\mu \to e + \gamma$, $\mu \to e + majoron$ and $\mu \to 3e$. "
We calculate the electric field and the curl of the magnetic monopole current for U(1) and for SU(2) in the maximal abelian gauge in the mid- plane between a quark antiquark pair. The results can be understood as a dual Abrikosov vortex in the Ginzburg-Landau theory. 
Remarks about highest weight states of the underlying quantum group are corrected. 
"Semi-infinite cohomology is constructed from scratch as the proper generalization of finite dimensional Lie algebra cohomology. The differential d and other operators are realized as universal inner deri- vations of a completed algebra, which acts on any appropriate semi-infinite complex. In particular, d is shown to be the unique derivation satisfying the ""Cartan identity"" and certain natural degree conditions. The proof that d is square-zero may well be the shortest (arguably, the only) one in print. "
"High-energy spin physics became a popular topic recently after the EMC finding for the proton's spin content. There exist unmeasured spin-dependent structure functions ($b_1$, $b_2$, $b_3$, and $b_4$) for spin-one hadrons such as the deuteron. The tensor structure function $b_1(x)$ could be measured by the proposed 15 GeV European Electron Facility. The measurement provides important clues to physics of non-nucleonic components in spin-one nuclei and to tensor structures on the quark-parton level. "
"For the theory of a single scalar field $\varphi$ with a quartic potential $V(\varphi)$, we find semi-analytic expressions for the Euclidean action in both four and three dimensions. The action in four dimensions determines the quantum tunneling rate at zero temperature from a false vacuum state to the true vacuum state; similarly, the action in three dimensions determines the thermal tunneling rate for a finite temperature theory. We show that for all quartic potentials, the action can be obtained from a one parameter family of instanton solutions corresponding to a one parameter family of differential equations. We find the solutions numerically and use polynomial fitting formulae to obtain expressions for the Euclidean action. These results allow one to calculate tunneling rates for the entire possible range of quartic potentials, from the thin-wall (nearly degenerate) limit to the opposite limit of vanishing barrier height. We also present a similar calculation for potentials containing $\varphi^4 \ln \varphi^2$ terms, which arise in the one-loop approximation to the effective potential in electroweak theory. "
"Talk given at the 26th Workshop: ``From Superstrings to Supergravity"", Erice - Sicily, 5-12 December 1992. We review the superconformal properties of 2d matter coupled to gravity, and extensions thereof. Focusing on topological strings, we recall how the superconformal structure helps to provide a direct link between Liouville theory coupled to matter, and matrix models. We also construct an infinite class of new theories based on $W$-gravity. "
"The wheeler-DeWitt method is applied to the quantization of the 1 + 1 dimensional dilaton gravity coupled with the conformal matter fields. Exact solutions to the WD equations are found, which are interpreted as right(left)-moving black holes. "
"We evaluate $f_{\pi}/ m_{\rho}$, $f_K/ m_{\rho}$, $1/f_{\rho}$, and $ m_{\phi}/(f_{\phi} m_{\rho})$, extrapolated to physical quark mass, zero lattice spacing and infinite volume, for lattice QCD with Wilson quarks in the valence (quenched) approximation. The predicted $m_{\phi}/(f_{\phi} m_{\rho})$ differs from experiment by less than its statistical uncertainty of approximately 15\%. The other three constants are 10\% to 20\% below experiment, equivalent to between one and two times the corresponding statistical uncertainties. "
"Using an argument due to Regge and Teitelboim, an expression for the ADM mass of 2d quantum dilaton gravity is obtained. By evaluating this expression we establish that the quantum theories which can be written as a Liouville-like theory, have a lower bound to energy, provided there is no critical boundary. This fact is then reconciled with the observation made earlier that the Hawking radiation does not appear to stop. The physical picture that emerges is that of a black hole in a bath of quantum radiation. We also evaluate the ADM mass for the models with RST boundary conditions and find that negative values are allowed. The Bondi mass of these models goes to zero for large retarded times, but becomes negative at intermediate times in a manner that is consistent with the thunderpop of RST. "
The Kerr geometry is represented as being created by a source moving along an analytical complex world-line. The equivalence of this complex world-line and an Euclidean version of complex strings (hyperbolic strings) is discussed. It is shown that the complex Kerr source satisfies the corresponding string equations. The boundary conditions of the complex Euclidean strings require an orbifold-like structure of the world-sheet. The related orbifold-like structure of the Kerr geometry is discussed. 
"Two-dimensional quantum gravity with an $R^2$ term is investigated in the continuum framework. It is shown that the partition function for small area $A$ is highly suppressed by an exponential factor $exp \{ -2\pi (1-h)^2/(m^2A) \}$, where $1/m^2$ is the coefficient (times $32\pi$) of $R^2$ and $h$ is the genus of the surface. Although positivity is violated, at a short distance scale ( $\ll 1/m$) surfaces are smooth and the problem of the branched polymer is avoided. "
"We explore the usefulness of very energetic linear $e^+e^-$ colliders in the $TeV$ range in studying an alternative scheme of electroweak symmetry breaking based on a strong interacting sector. The calculations are performed within the BESS model which contains new vector resonances. If the mass $M_V$ of the new boson multiplet lies not far from the maximum machine energy, or if it is lower, such a resonant contribution would be quite manifest. A result of our analysis is that also virtual effects are important. It appears that annihilation into a fermion pair in such machines, at the considered luminosities, would improve only marginally on existing limits if polarized beams are available and left-right asymmetries are measured. On the other hand, the process of $W$-pair production by $e^+e^-$ annihilation would allow for sensitive tests of the hypothesized strong sector, especially if the $W$ polarizations are reconstructed from their decay distributions, and the more so the higher the energy of the machine. An $e^+e^-$ collider with c.m. energy $\sqrt{s}=500~GeV$ could improve the limits on the model for the range $500<M_V(GeV)<1000$ when $W$ polarization is not reconstructed. If $W$ polarizations are reconstructed, then the bounds improve for the entire expected range of $M_V$. These bounds become more stringent for larger energy of the collider. We have also studied the detectability of the new resonances through the fusion subprocesses, but this channel does not seem to be interesting even for a collider with a c.m. energy $\sqrt{s}=2~TeV$. "
"The results of extensive Monte Carlo simulations of magnetic-field induced transitions in the xy model on a stacked triangular lattice with antiferromagnetic intraplane and ferromagnetic interplane interactions are discussed. A low-field transition from the paramagnetic to a 3-state (Potts) phase is found to be very weakly first order with behavior suggesting tricriticality at zero field. In addition to clarifying some long-standing ambiguity concerning the nature of this Potts-like transition, the present work also serves to further our understanding of the critical behavior at $T_N$, about which there has been much controversy. "
"We consider the (massless) scalar field on a 2-dimensional manifold with metric that changes signature from Lorentzian to Euclidean. Requiring a conserved momentum in the spatially homogeneous case leads to a particular choice of propagation rule. The resulting mix of positive and negative frequencies depends only on the total (conformal) size of the spacelike regions and not on the detailed form of the metric. Reformulating the problem using junction conditions, we then show that the solutions obtained above are the unique ones which satisfy the natural distributional wave equation everywhere. We also give a variational approach, obtaining the same results from a natural Lagrangian. (PACS numbers 04.20.Cv and 02.40.+m.) "
"Extrapolations of numerical data obtained from finite cluster calculations to the infinite volume limit can often give incorrect results. We discuss four separate cases: (a) the intensity of the lowest two-photon absorption in the infinite polyene, (b) bond alternation in the infinite polyene, (c) Cooper type pairing in the simple Hubbard model, and (d) pairing within the extended Hubbard model. "
"A theory of gravitation is constructed in which all homogeneous and isotropic solutions are nonsingular, and in which all curvature invariants are bounded. All solutions for which curvature invariants approach their limiting values approach de Sitter space. The action for this theory is obtained by a higher derivative modification of Einstein's theory. We expect that our model can easily be generalized to solve the singularity problem also for anisotropic cosmologies. "
"Higher-derivative generalization of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics is proposed. It is formally based on the standard superalgebra but supercharges involve differential operators of the order $n$. As a result, their anticommutator entails polynomial of a Hamiltonian. The Witten index does not characterize spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in such models. "
We study the t-J model in one dimension by numerically projecting the true ground state from a Luttinger liquid trial wave function. We find the model exhibits Luttinger liquid behavior for most of the phase diagram in which interaction strength and density are varied. However at small densities and high interaction strengths a new phase with a gap to spin excitations and enhanced superconducting correlations is found. We show this phase is a Luther-Emery liquid and study its correlation functions. 
"An application of the particular type of nonlinear operator algebras to spectral problems is outlined. These algebras are associated with a set of one-dimensional self-similar potentials, arising due to the q-periodic closure f_{j+N}(x)=qf_j(qx), k_{j+N}=q^2 k_j of a chain of coupled Riccati equations (dressing chain). Such closure describes q-deformation of the finite-gap and related potentials. The N=1 case corresponds to the q-oscillator spectrum generating algebra. At N=2 one gets a q-conformal quantum mechanics, and N=3 set of equations describes a deformation of the Painleve IV transcendent. "
We show how conformal invariance predicts the functional form of two-point correlators in one-dimensional periodic quantum systems. Numerical evidence for this functional form in a wide class of models --- including long-ranged ones --- is given and it is shown how this may be used to significantly speed up calculations of critical exponents. 
"Within a microscopic approach which takes into account RPA configurations, the single-particle continuum and more complex $1p1h\otimes phonon$ configurations isoscalar and isovector M1 excitations for the unstable nuclei ${56,78}$Ni and ${100,132}$Sn are calculated. For comparison, the experimentally known M1 excitations in ${40}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb have also been calculated. In the latter nuclei good agreement in the centroid energy, the total transition strength and the resonance width is obtained. With the same parameters we predict the magnetic excitations for the unstable nuclei. The strength is sufficiently concentrated to be measurable in radioactive beam experiments. New features are found for the very neutron rich nucleus ${78}$Ni and the neutron deficient nucleus ${100}$Sn. "
"We study the possibility to test CP invariance in the $W^+W^-$ production via photon fusion at NLC. The predictions of the CP violation effects are made within two Higgs doublet extensions of the minimal standard model, where CP violation is introduced by a neutral Higgs exchange in s channel in our case. The width effect in the Higgs propagator on the CP violation effects is studied in detail. The CP violation effects can be measured in some parameter region of the extensions. "
A quantum version of 2D super dilaton gravity containing a black hole is constructed for $N>8$. A previous disagreement as to whether this is possible or not is resolved. 
"A covariant formalism for physical perturbations propagating along a string in an arbitrary curved spacetime is developed. In the case of a stationary string in a static background the propagation of the perturbations is described by a wave-equation with a potential consisting of 2 terms: The first term describing the time-dilation and the second is connected with the curvature of space. As applications of the developed approach the propagation of perturbations along a stationary string in Rindler, de Sitter, Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes are investigated. "
"Talk given at the 26th Workshop: ``From Superstrings to Supergravity"" Erice - Sicily, 5-12 December 1992: In this talk we discuss string consistency requirements on four dimensional string models, namely the cancellation of target space duality anomalies. The analysis is explicitly performed for (hypothetical) orbifold models assuming the massless spectrum of the supersymmetric standard model. In addition, some phenomenological properties of four-dimensional strings, like the unification of the standard model gauge coupling constants and soft supersymmetry breaking parameters, are investigated. "
"The measurement or constraint of the masses of neutron stars and their binary companions tests theories of neutron star structure and of pulsar formation and evolution. We have measured the rate of the general relativistic advance of the longitude of periastron for the pulsar PSR B1802$-$07: $\dot\omega=0\fdg060\pm0\fdg009\,\mbox{yr}^{-1}$, which implies a total system mass, pulsar plus companion star, of $M=1.7\pm0.4\,\Msun$. We also present a much improved measurement of the rate of periastron advance for PSR B2303+46: $\dot\omega = 0\fdg0099\pm0\fdg0002\,\mbox{yr}^{-1}$, implying $M=2.53\pm0.08\,\Msun$ for this system. We discuss the available constraints on distribution of mass between the pulsars and their companions, and we compare the pulsar masses with other determinations of neutron star masses. "
"The inflationary cosmology is analyzed from the point of view of squeezed quantum states. As noted by Grishchuk and Sidorov, the amplification of quantum fluctuations into macroscopic perturbations which occurs during cosmic inflation is a process of quantum squeezing. We carefully develop the squeezed state formalism and derive the equations that govern the evolution of a gaussian initial state. We derive the power spectrum of density perturbations for a simple inflationary model and discuss its features. We conclude that the squeezed state formalism provides an interesting framework within which to study the amplification process, but,in disagreement with the claims of Grishchuk and Sidorov, that it does {\em not} provide us with any new physical results. "
"The unification of gauge and Yukawa couplings within the minimal supersymmetric standard model is studied at the two loop level. We derive an expression for the effective scale, $T_{SUSY}$, which characterizes the supersymmetric particle threshold corrections to the gauge couplings, and demonstrate that $T_{SUSY}$ is only slightly dependent on the squark and slepton masses, and strongly dependent on the Higgsino masses as well as on the mass ratio of the gauginos of the strong and weak interactions. Moreover, the value of the top quark Yukawa coupling necessary to achieve the unification of bottom and tau Yukawa couplings is also governed by $T_{SUSY}$, and it yields predictions for the top quark mass which are close to the quasi infrared fixed point results associated with the triviality bounds on this quantity. From the requirement of perturbative consistency of the top quark Yukawa sector of the theory, we obtain constraints on the allowed splitting of the supersymmetric spectrum, which, for certain values of the running bottom quark mass, are stronger than those ones coming from the experimental constraints on the strong gauge coupling. "
"Some aspects of the rotating three-dimensional Einstein-Anti-de-Sitter black hole solution, constructed recently by Banados, Teitelboim and Zanelli are discussed. It is shown explicitly that this black hole represents the most general black hole type solution of the Einstein-Anti-de-Sitter theory. The interpretation of one of the integrals of motion as the spin is discussed. Its physics relies on the topological structure of the black hole manifold, and the notion of simultaneity of space-like separated intervals. The relationship of the black hole solution to string theory on a $2 + 1$ dimensional target space is examined, and it is shown that the black hole can be understood as a part of the full axion-dilaton-gravity, realized as a WZWN $\sigma $ model. In conclusion, the pertinence of this solution to four-dimensional black strings and topologically massive gravity is pointed out. "
"The motion of relativistic particles around three dimensional black holes following the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism is studied. It follows that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation can be separated and reduced to quadratures in analogy with the four dimensional case. It is shown that: a) particles are trapped by the black hole independently of their energy and angular momentum, b) matter alway falls to the centre of the black hole and cannot understake a motion with stables orbits as in four dimensions. For the extreme values of the angular momentum of the black hole, we were able to find exact solutions of the equations of motion and trajectories of a test particle. "
"By viewing the covers of a fractal as a statistical mechanical system, the exact capacity of a multifractal is computed. The procedure can be extended to any multifractal described by a scaling function to show why the capacity and Hausdorff dimension are expected to be equal. "
"We investigate the spectral properties of a random matrix model, which in the large $N$ limit, embodies the essentials of the QCD partition function at low energy. The exact spectral density and its pair correlation function are derived for an arbitrary number of flavors and zero topological charge. Their microscopic limit provide the master formulae for sum rules for the inverse powers of the eigenvalues of the QCD Dirac operator as recently discussed by Leutwyler and Smilga. "
"We present a detailed study of the dynamic response of a ring of $N$ equally spaced Josephson junctions to a time-periodic external flux, including screening current effects. The dynamics are described by the resistively shunted Josephson junction model, appropriate for proximity effect junctions, and we include Faraday's law for the flux. We find that the time-averaged $I-V$ characteristics show novel {\em subharmonic giant Shapiro voltage resonances}, which strongly depend on having phase slips or not, on $N$, on the inductance and on the external drive frequency. We include an estimate of the possible experimental parameters needed to observe these quantized voltage spikes. "
Nonlinearity of electromagnetic field vibrations described by q-oscillators is shown to produce essential dependence of second correlation functions on intensity and deformation of Planck distribution. Experimental tests of such nonlinearity are suggested. 
"We investigate the heavy baryons which arise as solitonic excitations in a ``heavy meson"" chiral Lagrangian which includes the light vector particles. It is found that the effect of the light vectors may be substantial. We also present a simple derivation which clearly shows the connection to the Callan-Klebanov approach. "
"By building a general dynamical model for quantum measurement process,it is shown that the factorization of reduced evolution operator sufficiently results in the quantum mechanical realization of the wave packet collapse and the state correlation between the measured system and the measuring instrument-detector.This realizability is largely independent of the details of both the interaction and Hamiltonian of detector. The Coleman-Hepp model and all its generalizations are only the special cases of the more universal model given in this letter.An explicit example of this model is finally given in connection with coherent state. "
The apparent superluminal growth in the size of a sufficiently large part of the universe can be ascribed to the special relativistic effect of time dilation. 
"In the framework of communication theory, we analyse the gedanken experiment in which beams of quanta bearing information are flashed towards a black hole. We show that stimulated emission at the horizon provides a correlation between incoming and outgoing radiations consisting of bosons. For fermions, the mechanism responsible for the correlation is the Fermi exclusion principle. Each one of these mechanisms is responsible for the a partial transfer of the information originally coded in the incoming beam to the black--hole radiation. We show that this process is very efficient whenever stimulated emission overpowers spontaneous emission (bosons). Thus, black holes are not `ultimate waste baskets of information'. "
"The dominant production mechanism for heavy quark-antiquark bound states in very high energy processes is fragmentation, the splitting of a high energy parton into a quarkonium state and other partons. We show that the fragmentation functions $D(z,\mu)$ describing these processes can be calculated using perturbative QCD. We calculate the fragmentation functions for a gluon to split into S-wave quarkonium states to leading order in the QCD coupling constant. The leading logarithms of $\mu/m_Q$, where $\mu$ is the factorization scale and $m_Q$ is the heavy quark mass, are summed up using Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations. "
"It is shown that for a wide class of analytic Lagrangians which depend only on the scalar curvature of a metric and a connection, the application of the so--called ``Palatini formalism'', i.e., treating the metric and the connection as independent variables, leads to ``universal'' equations. If the dimension $n$ of space--time is greater than two these universal equations are Einstein equations for a generic Lagrangian and are suitably replaced by other universal equations at bifurcation points. We show that bifurcations take place in particular for conformally invariant Lagrangians $L=R^{n/2} \sqrt g$ and prove that their solutions are conformally equivalent to solutions of Einstein equations. For 2--dimensional space--time we find instead that the universal equation is always the equation of constant scalar curvature; the connection in this case is a Weyl connection, containing the Levi--Civita connection of the metric and an additional vectorfield ensuing from conformal invariance. As an example, we investigate in detail some polynomial Lagrangians and discuss their bifurcations. "
"We study the quantization of the curved spacetime created by ultrarelativistic particles at Planckian energies. We consider a minisuperspace model based on the classical shock wave metric generated by these particles, and for which the Wheeler - De Witt equation is solved exactly. The wave function of the geometry is a Bessel function whose argument is the classical action. This allows us to describe not only the semiclassical regime $(S\to\infty),$ but also the strong quantum regime $(S\to0).$ We analyze the interaction with a scalar field $\phi$ and apply the third quantization formalism to it. The quantum gravity effects make the system to evolve from a highly curved semiclassical geometry (a gravitational wave metric) into a strongly quantum state represented by a weakly curved geometry (essentially flat spacetime).

"Relevant features of the dynamic structure function $S(q,\omega)$ in $^3$He-$^4$He mixtures at zero temperature are investigated starting from known properties of the ground state. Sum rules are used to fix rigorous constraints to the different contributions to $S(q,\omega)$, coming from $^3$He and $^4$He elementary excitations, as well as to explore the role of the cross term $S^{(3,4)}(q,\omega)$. Both the low-$q$ (phonon-roton $^4$He excitations and 1p-1h $^3$He excitations) and high-$q$ (deep inelastic scattering) ranges are discussed. "
"A general definition of a black hole is given, and general `laws of black-hole dynamics' derived. The definition involves something similar to an apparent horizon, a trapping horizon, defined as a hypersurface foliated by marginal surfaces of one of four non-degenerate types, described as future or past, and outer or inner. If the boundary of an inextendible trapped region is suitably regular, then it is a (possibly degenerate) trapping horizon. The future outer trapping horizon provides the definition of a black hole. Outer marginal surfaces have spherical or planar topology. Trapping horizons are null only in the instantaneously stationary case, and otherwise outer trapping horizons are spatial and inner trapping horizons are Lorentzian. Future outer trapping horizons have non-decreasing area form, constant only in the null case---the `second law'. A definition of the trapping gravity of an outer trapping horizon is given, generalizing surface gravity. The total trapping gravity of a compact outer marginal surface has an upper bound, attained if and only if the trapping gravity is constant---the `zeroth law'. The variation of the area form along an outer trapping horizon is determined by the trapping gravity and an energy flux---the `first law'. "
"We review recent results concerning the representation of conformal field theory characters in terms of fermionic quasi-particle excitations, and describe in detail their construction in the case of the integrable three-state Potts chain. These fermionic representations are $q$-series which are generalizations of the sums occurring in the Rogers-Ramanujan identities.

: Algebraic properties of orbifold models on arbitrary Riemann surfaces are investigated. The action of mapping class group transformations and of standard geometric operations is given explicitly. An infinite dimensional extension of the quantum group is presented. 
"We examine the possibility that a nearby supernova explosion could have caused one or more of the mass extinctions identified by palaeontologists. We discuss the likely rate of such events in the light of the recent identification of Geminga as a supernova remnant less than 100 pc away and the discovery of a millisecond pulsar about 150 pc away, and observations of SN 1987A. The fluxes of $\gamma$ radiation and charged cosmic rays on the Earth are estimated, and their effects on the Earth's ozone layer discussed. A supernova explosion of the order of 10 pc away could be expected every few hundred million years, and could destroy the ozone layer for hundreds of years, letting in potentially lethal solar ultraviolet radiation. In addition to effects on land ecology, this could entail mass destruction of plankton and reef communities, with disastrous consequences for marine life as well. A supernova extinction should be distinguishable from a meteorite impact such as the one that presumably killed the dinosaurs. "
"The general production {\it and} decay mechanism of $\ttbar$ in future high-energy $\epem$ colliders has been investigated in a model-independent way, focusing on an observation of possible CP violation. Angular asymmetries sensitive to CP violation either in the production {\it or} in the subsequent decays have been found. General considerations are illustrated through 1-loop effects induced by gluino exchange in the supersymmetric version of the Standard Model. "
"The two-loop effective action for the SU(3) gauge model in a constant background field ${\bar A}_0(x,t)=B_0^3T_3+B_0^8T_8$ is recalculated for a gauge with an arbitrary $\xi$-parameter. The gauge-invariant thermodynamical potential is found and its extremum points are investigated. Within a two-loop order we find that the stable nontrivial vacuum is completely equivalent to the trivial one but when the high order corrections being taken into account the indifferent equilibrium seems to be broken. Briefly we also discuss the infrared peculiarities and their status for the gauge models with a nonzero condensate. "
"The Cabibbo allowed non-leptonic $B$-decays in two hadrons are studied, within the factorization hypothesis, in the framework of Isgur and Wise theory for the matrix elements of the $\Delta B=-\Delta C=\pm 1$ weak currents. The $SU(2)_{HF}$ symmetry relates $|\Delta B|=1$ to $|\Delta C|=1$ currents, which have been measured in the semileptonic strange decays of charmed particles. By assuming colour screening and allowing for $SU(3)$ invariant contributions from the annihilation terms with charmed final states one is able to comply with the present experimental knowledge.\\ The $CP$ violating asymmetries in neutral $B$ decays are given for charmed final states in terms of the $K-M$ angles. With the central values found for the annihilation parameters there is a destructive (constructive) interference between the direct and annihilation terms in the Cabibbo allowed (doubly forbidden) amplitudes for the decays into $D^{0}(D^{*0})\pi^0$ and $D^0\rho^0$ so that they may be of the same order. This would imply large asymmetries, for which however our present knowledge on the amplitudes does not allow to predict even their sign.\\ We have better confidence in our predictions for the charged final states than the neutral ones and can draw the conclusion that the detection of the corresponding asymmetries requires, at least, $10^6$ tagged neutral $B$-particles. "
"Exact operator quantization is perfomed of a model of two-dimensional dilaton gravity in Lorentzian spacetime, classically equivalent to the one proposed by Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger, in the special case with 24 massless matter scalars. This is accomplished by developing a non-linear and non-local quantum canonical transformation of basic interacting fields into a set of free fields, rigorously taking into account the spatially closed boundary condition. The quantized model enjoys conformal invariance and the entire set of physical states and operators are obtained in the BRST formalism. In addition, a rather detailed discussion of the nature of the basic issues for exact treatment of models of quantum gravity is provided. "
The solitonic sector of the Nambu - Jona-Lasinio model with baryon number one is solved in the presence of an external medium. The calculations fully include the polarization of both the Dirac sea and the medium as well as the Pauli blocking effect. We found that with an increasing density the medium destabilizes the soliton. At finite medium density the soliton mass gets reduced whereas the mean square baryon radius shows an increase - a swelling of the soliton. At some critical density of about two times nuclear matter density there is no localized solution - the soliton disappears. 
"There were some errors in paper hep-th/9303018 in formulas 6.1, 6.6, 6.8, 6.11. These errors have been corrected in the present version of this paper. There are also some minor changes in the introduction. "
We develop a general algorithm for describing angular decay distributions in cascade decay chains of arbitrary length. The general algorithm is used to study joint angular decay distributions for the cascade decay $B\rightarrow D^{**}( \rightarrow D^*(\rightarrow D \pi)+\pi) + W(\rightarrow l\nu)$ where the $D^{**}$ is a generic $P$-wave charm meson state. Lepton mass effects are fully incorporated 
"The recent classification of Landau--Ginzburg potentials and their abelian symmetries focuses attention on a number of models with large positive Euler number for which no mirror partner is known. All of these models are related to Calabi--Yau manifolds in weighted $\IP_4$, with a characteristic structure of the defining polynomials. A closer look at these potentials suggests a series of non-linear transformations, which relate the models to configurations for which a construction of the mirror is known, though only at certain points in moduli space. A special case of these transformations generalizes the $\ZZ_2$ orbifold representation of the $D$ invariant, implying a hidden symmetry in tensor products of minimal models. "
"We consider the consequences of describing the metric properties of space- time through a quartic line element $ds^4=G_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}dx^\mu dx^\nu dx^\lambda dx^\rho$. The associated ""metric"" is a fourth-rank tensor $G_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}$. We construct a theory for the gravitational field based on the fourth-rank metric $G_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}$ which is conformally invariant in four dimensions. In the absence of matter the fourth-rank metric becomes of the form $G_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}=g_{(\mu\nu}g_{\lambda\rho )}$ therefore we recover a Riemannian behaviour of the geometry; furthermore, the theory coincides with General Relativity. In the presence of matter we can keep Riemannianicity, but now gravitation couples in a different way to matter as compared to General Relativity. We develop a simple cosmological model based on a FRW metric with matter described by a perfect fluid. Our field equations predict that the entropy is an increasing function of time. For $k_{obs}=0$ the field equations predict $\Omega\approx 4y$, where $y={p\over\rho}$; for $\Omega_{small}=0.01$ we obtain $y_{pred}=2.5\times 10^{-3}$. $y$ can be estimated from the mean random velocity of typical galaxies to be $y_{random}=1\times10^{-5}$. For the early universe there is no violation of causality for $t>t_{class}\approx10^{19}t_{Planck}\approx 10^{-24}s$. "

"The possible role of the van Hove singularity (vHs) in stabilizing the low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) phase transition in La$_{2-x}$\-Sr$_x$\-CuO$_ 4$ (LSCO) is discussed. It is found that the vHs can drive a structural distortion in two different ways, either due to spin-orbit coupling or to dynamic Jahn-Teller (JT) effects. This paper discusses the latter effect in some detail. It is shown that a model Hamiltonian introduced earlier to describe the coupled electron -- octahedral tilt motions (`cageons') has a series of phase transitions, from a high-temperature disordered JT phase (similar to the high-temperature tetragonal phase of LSCO) to an intermediate temperature dynamic JT phase, of average orthorhombic symmetry (the LTO phase) to a low temperature static JT phase (the low temperature tetragonal phase). For some parameter values, the static JT phase is absent. "
"The low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) phase transition in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ can be interpreted as a dynamic Jahn-Teller effect, in which the degenerate electronic states are associated with the large densities of states at the two van Hove singularities. The equations describing this phase are strongly nonlinear. This paper illustrates some consequences of the nonlinearity, by presenting a rich variety of exact nonlinear wave solutions for the model. Of particular interest are soliton lattice solutions: arrays of domain walls separating regions of local low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) symmetry. These arrays have a {\it macroscopic} average symmetry higher than LTT. These lattices can display either orthorhombic (`orthons') or tetragonal (`tetrons') symmetry, and can serve as models for a microscopic description of the dynamic JT LTO and high-temperature tetragonal phases, respectively.

"The recent renaissance of wormhole physics has led to a very disturbing observation: If traversable wormholes exist then it appears to be rather easy to to transform such wormholes into time machines. This extremely disturbing state of affairs has lead Hawking to promulgate his chronology protection conjecture. This paper continues a program begun in an earlier paper [Physical Review {\bf D47}, 554--565 (1993), hepth@xxx/9202090]. An explicit calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the renormalized stress--energy tensor in wormhole spacetimes is presented. Point--splitting techniques are utilized. Particular attention is paid to computation of the Green function [in its Hadamard form], and the structural form of the stress-energy tensor near short closed spacelike geodesics. Detailed comparisons with previous calculations are presented, leading to a pleasingly unified overview of the situation. "
The nonanalytic $g^3$-term is calculated for SU(2)-effective action at finite temperature and the status of a gauge fields condensation is briefly discussed. 
"The van Vleck determinant is an ubiquitous object, arising in many physically interesting situations such as: (1) WKB approximations to quantum time evolution operators and Green functions. (2) Adiabatic approximations to heat kernels. (3) One loop approximations to functional integrals. (4) The theory of caustics in geometrical optics and ultrasonics. (5) The focussing and defocussing of geodesic flows in Riemannian manifolds. While all of these topics are interrelated, the present paper is particularly concerned with the last case and presents extensive theoretical developments that aid in the computation of the van Vleck determinant associated with geodesic flows in Lorentzian spacetimes. {\sl A fortiori} these developments have important implications for the entire array of topics indicated.

"Lines generated by marginal deformations of WZW models are considered. The Weyl symmetry at the WZW point implies the existence of a duality symmetry on such lines. The duality is interpreted as a broken gauge symmetry in string theory. It is shown that at the two end points the axial and vector cosets are obtained. This shows that the axial and vector cosets are equivalent CFTs both in the compact and the non-compact cases. Moreover, it is shown that there are $\s$-model deformations that interpolate smoothly between manifolds with different topologies. "
"We study the evolution of cosmic strings taking into account the frictional force due to the surrounding radiation. We consider small perturbations on straight strings, oscillation of circular loops and small perturbations on circular loops. For straight strings, friction exponentially suppresses perturbations whose co-moving scale crosses the horizon before cosmological time $t_*\sim \mu^{-2}$ (in Planck units), where $\mu$ is the string tension. Loops with size much smaller than $t_*$ will be approximately circular at the time when they start the relativistic collapse. We investigate the possibility that such loops will form black holes. We find that the number of black holes which are formed through this process is well bellow present observational limits, so this does not give any lower or upper bounds on $\mu$. We also consider the case of straight strings attached to walls and circular holes that can spontaneously nucleate on metastable domain walls. "
"The sigma model action described in this paper differs in four important features from the usual sigma model action for the four-dimensional Green-Schwarz heterotic superstring in a massless background. Firstly, the action is constructed on an N=(2,0) super-worldsheet using a Kahler potential and an Ogievetsky-Sokatchev constraint; secondly, the target-space background fields are unconstrained; thirdly, the target-space dilaton couples to the two-dimensional curvature; and fourthly, the action reduces in a flat background to a free-field action. A conjecture is made for generalizing this N=(2,0) sigma model action to the ten-dimensional Green-Schwarz heterotic superstring in a manner that preserves these four new features. "
"We derive the moduli dependent threshold corrections to gauge couplings in toroidal orbifold compactifications. The underlying six dimensional torus lattice of the heterotic string theory is not assumed ---as in previous calculations--- to decompose into a direct sum of a four--dimensional and a two--dimensional sublattice, with the latter lying in a plane left fixed by a set of orbifold twists. In this more general case the threshold corrections are no longer automorphic functions of the modular group, but of certain congruence subgroups of the modular group. These groups can also be obtained by studying the massless spectrum; moreover they have larger classes of automorphic functions. As a consequence the threshold corrections cannot be uniquely determined by symmetry considerations and certain boundary conditions at special points in the moduli space, as was claimed in previous publications. "
"Modifications of baryon properties due to the restoration of the chiral symmetry in an external hot and dense baryon medium are investigated in an effective chiral quark-meson theory. The nucleon arises as a soliton of the Gell-Mann - L\'evi $\zs$-model, the parameters of which are chosen to be the medium-modified meson values evaluated within the Nambu - Jona-Lasinio model. The nucleon properties are obtained by means of variational projection techniques. The nucleon form factors as well as the nucleon delta transition form factors are evaluated for various densities and temperatures of the medium. Similar to the chiral phase transition line the critical curve in the $T-\zr$ plane for delocalization of the nucleon is non-monotonic and this feature is reflected in all nucleon properties. At medium densities of about $(2-3) \rnm$ the baryonic phase exists only at intermediate temperatures. For finite temperature and densities the nucleon form factors get strongly reduced at finite transfer momenta. "
"The Nambu - Jona-Lasinio model in its SU(2) and SU(3) versions with scalar and pseudoscalar coupling are applied to baryons. The parameters of the model are fixed in the meson sector. The baryons arise as a soliton of three valence quarks coupled to the Dirac sea (quark-antiquarks pairs). Within the SU(2) version the nucleon static properties as well as some form factors, namely, the electric and axial ones are described quite successfully. The nucleon-delta splitting comes out reasonable. In medium the nucleonic soliton gets less stable -- the mass is reduced whereas the radius increases. At some critical medium density there is a clear delocalization of the soliton: The nucleon does not exsist anymore as a soliton. In SU(3) version the strangness carrying baryons are described as SU(3)-rotational excitations of the SU(2)-soliton embedded in the SU(3)-sector. The mass splittings between the octet and decuplet as well as within the multiplets are peproduced not only in a correct oder but also in a good agreement with the experimantal values. "
"The valley method for computing the total high-energy anomalous cross section $S_{anom}$ is the extension of the optical theorem to the case of instanton-antiinstanton backgrounds. As a toy model for baryon number violation in Electroweak theory, we consider a version of the $O(3)$ $\sigma$ model in which the conformal invariance is broken perturbatively. We show that at a critical energy the saddle-point values of the instanton size and instanton-antiinstanton separation bifurcate into complex conjugate pairs. This nonanalytic behavior signals the breakdown of the valley method at an energy where $S_{anom}$ is still exponentially suppressed. (Figures replaced 5/3/93). "
"Previous large $N$ calculations are combined with numerical work at $N=4$ to show that the Minimal Standard Model will describe physics to an accuracy of a few percent up to energies of the order 2 to 4 times the Higgs mass, $M_H$, only if $M_H \le 710\pm60 ~ GeV$. This bound is the result of a systematic search in the space of dimension six operators and is expected to hold in the {\it continuum}. Given that studying the scalar sector in isolation is already an approximation, we believe that our result is sufficiently accurate and that further refinements would be of progressively diminishing interest to particle physics.

A suggestive phenomenological relation is found among the lepton and quark masses which suggests a new insight into the problem of generations and also gives a prediction for the top quark mass in agreement with the range of values which is actually expected. 
"Has any progress been made on understanding and predicting the 13 parameters which describe the observed masses and mixing angles of the quarks and leptons? Arguments are given in favor of pursuing schemes in which grand unified and family symmetries provide many relations among these 13 parameters. A sequence of simple assumptions leads to a supersymmetric SO(10) theory with 8 predictions: $\tan \beta, m_t, V_{cb}, m_s, m_s/m_d$, $m_u/m_d, V_{ub}$ and the amount of CP violation $J$. These predictions are presented, together with experiments which will test them. "
"We consider the conformal properties of geometries described by higher-rank line elements. A crucial role is played by the conformal Killing equation (CKE). We introduce the concept of null-flat spaces in which the line element can be written as ${ds}^r=r!d\zeta_1\cdots d\zeta_r$. We then show that, for null-flat spaces, the critical dimension, for which the CKE has infinitely many solutions, is equal to the rank of the metric. Therefore, in order to construct an integrable conformal field theory in 4 dimensions we need to rely on fourth-rank geometry. We consider the simple model ${\cal L}={1\over 4} G^{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi\partial_\lambda\phi \partial_\rho\phi$ and show that it is an integrable conformal model in 4 dimensions. Furthermore, the associated symmetry group is ${Vir}^4$. "
"We examine the QCD corrections to the structure functions $F_2^\gamma(x,Q^2)$ and $F_L^\gamma(x,Q^2)$ for a real photon target. The pointlike photon contributions from light and heavy quarks are computed through $O(\alpha\alpha_S)$. A parameterization of the hadronic (resolved) photon contribution is also included and a comparison is made with the present experimental data. We find that while the pointlike contributions are large for $F_2^\gamma(x,Q^2)$, they are the dominant part of $F_L^\gamma(x,Q^2)$. For $Q^2 > 50$ $({\rm GeV}/c)^2$ the charm component is as least as large as the light quark component. "
CP violations in B meson decays at hadron colliders are reviewed. In particular I examine: $B^0-\bar{B^0}$ mixing and oscillations within Standard Model and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa picture for CP violations; $B^0$ decays into CP eigenstates and the measurements of the angles in the unitarity triangle; finally I consider a class of charged $B$ decays that allow to avoid uncertainties arising from the computation of hadronic matrix elements. 
"Considerable interest has recently been expressed in the entropy versus area relationship for ``dirty'' black holes --- black holes in interaction with various classical matter fields, distorted by higher derivative gravity, or infested with various forms of quantum hair. In many cases it is found that the entropy is simply related to the area of the event horizon: S = k A_H/(4\ell_P^2). For example, the ``entropy = (1/4) area'' law *holds* for: Schwarzschild, Reissner--Nordstrom, Kerr--Newman, and dilatonic black holes. On the other hand, the ``entropy = (1/4) area'' law *fails* for: various types of (Riemann)^n gravity, Lovelock gravity, and various versions of quantum hair. The pattern underlying these results is less than clear. This paper systematizes these results by deriving a general formula for the entropy: S = {k A_H/(4\ell_P^2)} + {1/T_H} \int_\Sigma [rho - {L}_E ] K^\mu d\Sigma_\mu + \int_\Sigma s V^\mu d\Sigma_\mu. (K^\mu is the timelike Killing vector, V^\mu the four velocity of a co--rotating observer.) If no hair is present the validity of the ``entropy = (1/4) area'' law reduces to the question of whether or not the Lorentzian energy density for the system under consideration is formally equal to the Euclideanized Lagrangian. ****** To appear in Physical Review D 15 July 1993 ****** [Stylistic changes, minor typos fixed, references updated, discussion of the Born-Infeld system excised] "
"We discuss the use of recursive enumeration schemes to obtain low and high temperature series expansions for discrete statistical systems. Using linear combinations of generalized helical lattices, the method is competitive with diagramatic approaches and is easily generalizable. We illustrate the approach using the Ising model and generate low temperature series in up to five dimensions and high temperature series in three dimensions. The method is general and can be applied to any discrete model. We describe how it would work for Potts models. "
Two phonon-states of alkali-metal clusters (treated as jellium spheres) are calculated by using a method based on a perturbative construction of periodic orbits of the time-dependent mean-field equations. Collective vibrations with various multipolarities in charged $Na^+_{21}$ are considered. 
"The interpretation of future precise experiments on atomic parity violation in terms of parameters of the Standard Model could be hampered by uncertainties in the atomic and nuclear structure. While the former can be overcome by measurement in a series of isotopes, the nuclear structure requires knowledge of the neutron density. We use the nuclear Hartree-Fock method, which includes deformation effects, to calculate the proton and neutron densities in {125}Cs-{139}Cs. We argue that the good agreement with the experimental charge radii, binding energies, and ground state spins signifies that the phenomenological nuclear force and the method of calculation that we use is adequate. Based on this agreement, and on calculations involving different effective interactions, we estimate the uncertainties in the differences of the neutron radii delta<r^2>_{N,N'} and conclude that they cause uncertainties in the ratio of weak charges, the quantities determined in the atomic parity nonconservation experiments, of less than 10^{-3}. Such an uncertainty is smaller than the anticipated experimental error. "
"The very small scales of isotropic, Navier-Stokes turbulence at Reynolds number ${\cal R}_\lambda \approx 15$ are studied by high-resolution direct numerical simulation (DNS) and by integration of the direct-interaction (DIA) equations. The DNS follows the tail of the energy spectrum over more than thirty decades of magnitude. The energy spectrum in the far-dissipation range $5k_d < k < 10k_d$ is well-fitted by $k^\alpha\exp(-ck/k_d)$, where $k_d$ is the Kolmogorov dissipation wavenumber, $\alpha \approx 3.3$ and $c\approx 7.1$. For values of $m$ that emphasize the far-dissipation range, the fields $(-\nabla^2)^m{\bf u}$ exhibit strong spatial intermittency, associated with gentle spatial variations of the lower-$k$ part of the velocity field. DIA analysis gives a prefactor $k^3$ and an exponential decay more rapid than DNS. Averaging over an ensemble of DIA solutions, suggested by the observed intermittency, removes some of the discrepancy. "
"A remarkable theorem of R. C. James is the following: suppose that $X$ is a Banach space and $C \subseteq X$ is a norm bounded, closed and convex set such that every linear functional $x^* \in X^*$ attains its supremum on $C$; then $C$ is a weakly compact set. Actually, this result is significantly stronger than this statement; indeed, the proof can be used to obtain other surprising results. For example, suppose that $X$ is a separable Banach space and $S$ is a norm separable subset of the unit ball of $X^*$ such that for each $x \in X$ there exists $x^* \in S$ such that $x^*(x) = \|x\|$ then $X^*$ is itself norm separable . If we call $S$ a support set, in this case, with respect to the entire space $X$, one can ask questions about the size and structure of a support set, a support set not only with respect to $X$ itself but perhaps with respect to some other subset of $X$@. We analyze one particular case of this as well as give some applications. "
In this paper we summarize the results of the theory working group dedicated to the analysis of $B_c$ production at hadron colliders. 
"The program of induced QCD requires that there exist self-interactions among the heavy matter fields (an adjoint scalar and a few fermions in the fundamental representation) which tend to spoil the asymptotic freedom of SU(N) gauge theory. We consider general interactions between such matter fields and show that, on the contrary, to two loops, they all tend to enhance asymptotic freedom in the perturbative regime. This result casts doubt on whether induced QCD is equivalent to real QCD. "
We review some recent applications of QCD sum rules to $B$-decays. These include the determination of the leptonic constant $f_B$ and of the semileptonic transition amplitudes of the $B$-meson into negative and positive parity charmed states. 
The Lie-Poisson analogues of the cotangent bundle and coadjoint orbits of a Lie group are considered. For the natural Poisson brackets the symplectic leaves in these manifolds are classified and the corresponding symplectic forms are described. Thus the construction of the Kirillov symplectic form is generalized for Lie-Poisson groups. 
"The heat coefficients related to the Laplace-Beltrami operator defined on the hyperbolic compact manifold $H^3/\Ga$ are evaluated in the case in which the discrete group $\Ga$ contains elliptic and hyperbolic elements. It is shown that while hyperbolic elements give only exponentially vanishing corrections to the trace of the heat kernel, elliptic elements modify all coefficients of the asymptotic expansion, but the Weyl term, which remains unchanged. Some physical consequences are briefly discussed in the examples. "
"Implementing the requirement that a field theory be invariant under Schwinger-Dyson BRST symmetry in the Hamiltonian formalism, we show the equivalence between Hamiltonian and Lagrangian BRST-formalism at the path integral level. The Lagrangian quantum master equation is derived as a direct consequence of the Fradkin-Vilkovisky theorem in Hamiltonian BRST quantisation. "
We extend the minimal model theorem to the 3-dimensional schemes which are projective and have semistable reduction over the spectrum of a Dedekind ring. 
"The three generation mirror fermion model is compared with LEP precision and low energy data. While for zero mixing of ordinary and mirror fermions the model is not favoured, for non zero mixing very low $\chi ^2 $ fits have been obtained, in particular when right handed leptonic mixings are small and left handed leptonic mixings are large (of the order of 0.1 radians.)

"We study an extended Skyrme model which includes fourth and sixth-order terms. We explore some static properties like the $\Delta$-nucleon mass splitting and investigate the Skyrmion breathing mode in the framework of the linear response theory. We find that the monopole response function has a pronounced peak located at $\sim$ 400 MeV, which we identify to the Roper resonance $N(1440)$. As compared to the standard one, the extended Skyrme model provides a more accurate description of baryon properties. "
"We review the status of theory and experiment of very rare and forbidden kaon decays. We then review the radiative non-leptonic decays, and the associated Dalitz pair modes. We pay particular attention to the study of long distance physics in radiative decays within the framework of chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT). We discuss the experiments that will run in the near future and the modes that they will be able to study. "
A new trigonometric degeneration of the Sklyanin algebra is found and the functional realization of its representations in space of polynomials in one variable is studied. A further contraction gives the standard quantum algebra $U_{q}(sl(2))$. It is shown that the degenerate Sklyanin algebra contains a subalgebra isomorphic to algebra of functions on the quantum sphere $(SU(2)/SO(2))_{q^{1\over2}}$. The diagonalization of general quadratic form in its generators leads in the functional realization to the difference equation for Askey-Wilson polynomials. 
"Within the quark model a generalization is proposed of the commonly used annihilation potential to describe antiproton-proton annihilation into two mesons, the so-called $^3P_0$ and $^3S_1$ mechanisms. This generalized potential treats the two mechanisms in a more symmetric way, has additional angular dependence, and results in an expanded set of selection rules. "
"We investigate the processes leading to phase-space equilibration of parton distributions in nuclear interactions at collider energies.

"The Laughlin states for $N$ interacting electrons at the plateaus of the fractional Hall effect are studied in the thermodynamic limit of large $N$. It is shown that this limit leads to the semiclassical regime for these states, thereby relating their stability to their semiclassical nature. The equivalent problem of two-dimensional plasmas is solved analytically, to leading order for $N\to\infty$, by the saddle point approximation - a two-dimensional extension of the method used in random matrix models of quantum gravity and gauge theories. To leading order, the Laughlin states describe classical droplets of fluids with uniform density and sharp boundaries, as expected from the Laughlin ``plasma analogy''. In this limit, the dynamical $W_\infty$-symmetry of the quantum Hall states expresses the kinematics of the area-preserving deformations of incompressible liquid droplets. "
"A set of coordinates in the non parametric loop-space is introduced. We show that these coordinates transform under infinite dimensional linear representations of the diffeomorphism group. An extension of the group of loops in terms of these objects is proposed. The enlarged group behaves locally as an infinite dimensional Lie group. Ordinary loops form a subgroup of this group. The algebraic properties of this new mathematical structure are analized in detail. Applications of the formalism to field theory, quantum gravity and knot theory are considered. "
We argue that the imaginary parts of the anomalous dimensions in the multiparticle sectors of heavy quark effective field theory may be removed by a suitable redefinition of the multiparticle states. The connection between the imaginary parts of the anomalous dimensions and the interquark potential is pointed out 
"We develop a lattice Boltzmann equation method for simulating multi-phase immiscible fluid flows with variation of density and viscosity, based on the model proposed by Gunstensen {\em et al} for two-component immiscible fluids. The numerical measurements of surface tension and viscosity agree well with theoretical predictions. Several basic numerical tests, including spinodal decomposition, two-phase fluid flows in two-dimensional channels and two-phase viscous fingering, are shown in agreement of experiments and analytical solutions. "
We investigate the recent conjecture that the chiral phase transition in non-compact lattice QED is driven by monopole condensation. The comparison of analytic and numerical results shows that we have a quantitative understanding of monopoles in both the quenched and dynamical cases. We can rule out monopole condensation. 
"{}~~~We show that the recently constructed $~N=4$~ supersymmetric self-dual Yang-Mills theory as the consistent background of \hbox{$~N=2$} open superstring will generate Witten's topological field theory in two-dimensions as a descendant theory after appropriate twisted dimensional reduction/truncations. We also show that this topological field theory further generates supersymmetric Korteweg de Vries equations, $~SL(n)\-$Toda theory and $~W_\infty\-$gravity in the $~n\rightarrow\infty$~ limit. Considering also that this topological field theory is to generate other integrable and topological systems, our results give supporting evidence for the conjecture that the $~N=2$~ open superstring theory is the underlying ``master theory'' of integrable and topological systems, {\it via} the intermediate $~N=4$~ supersymmetric self-dual Yang-Mills theory as its consistent target space-time background. "
"We generalize the results of a previous paper by one of the authors to show a relationship among a class of string solutions through $O(\tilde d, \tilde d)$ transformations. The results are applied to a rotating black hole solution of three dimensional general relativity discussed recently. We extend the black hole solution to string theory and show its connection with the three dimensional black string with nonzero momentum through an $O(\tilde d, \tilde d)$ transformation of the above type. "
"Classical W-algebras in higher dimensions have been recently constructed. In this letter we show that there is a finitely generated subalgebra which is isomorphic to the algebra of local diffeomorphisms in D dimensions. Moreover, there is a tower of infinitely many fields transforming under this subalgebra as symmetric tensorial one-densities. We also unravel a structure isomorphic to the Schouten symmetric bracket, providing a natural generalization of w_\infty in higher dimensions. "
"We obtain some new results on classical solutions of two dimensional Euclidean sigma models. From earlier work of Din-Zakrzewski, Glaser-Stora, and numerous differential geometers, one knows explicit solutions in the case of the $S^n$-model, the $CP^n$-model, and the $U(n)$-model. However, very little is known about the ""moduli space"" of solutions itself. In this paper we study the connected components of these spaces. In a subsequent paper (with M. Furuta and M. Kotani), we compute the fundamental group, in the case of the $S^n$-model. "
"We investigate the possibility of detecting CP--odd angular correlations in the various decay modes of the neutral Higgs boson including the modes of a $ZZ$ pair, a $W^+W^-$ pair, or a heavy quark pair. It is a natural way to probe the CP character of the Higgs boson once it is identified. Final state interactions (i.e. the absorptive decay amplitude) is not required in such correlations. As an illustrative example we take the fundamental source of the CP nonconservation to be in the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson to the heavy fermions. A similar correlation in the process $e^+e^- \to l^+ l^- H$ is also proposed. Our analysis of these correlations will be useful for experiments in future colliders such as LEP II, SSC, LHC or NLC. "
"We analyze a randomly perturbed quantum version of the baker's transformation, a prototype of an area-conserving chaotic map. By numerically simulating the perturbed evolution, we estimate the information needed to follow a perturbed Hilbert-space vector in time. We find that the Landauer erasure cost associated with this information grows very rapidly and becomes much larger than the maximum statistical entropy given by the logarithm of the dimension of Hilbert space. The quantum baker's map thus displays a hypersensitivity to perturbations that is analogous to behavior found earlier in the classical case. This hypersensitivity characterizes ``quantum chaos'' in a way that is directly relevant to statistical physics. "
We give a construction of Drienfeld's quantum double for a nonstandard deformation of Borel subalgebra of $sl(2)$. We construct explicitly some simple representations of this quantum algebra and from the universal R-matrix we obtain the explicit solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation in those cases. 
"We compute the fundamental group of the ""moduli space"" of classical solutions of the two dimensional Euclidean $S^n$-model. "
"The screening properties of fullerene molecules are described by means of a continuum model which uses the electronic wavefunctions of planar graphite as a starting point. The long distance behavior of the system gives rise to a renormalizable theory, which flows towards a non trivial fixed point. Its existence implies an anomalous dielectric constant. The screening properties are neither metallic nor insulating. Alternatively, the intramolecular screening is obtained from a simple approximation to the electronic wavefunctions. Intermolecular effects are also calculated. As a consistency check, it is shown that the observed polarizability of C$_{60}$ is well eproduced. "
"The tensor product of the division algebras, which is a kernel for the structure of the Standard Model, is also a root for the Clifford algebra of (1,9)-space-time. A conventional Dirac Lagrangian, employing the (1,9)-Dirac operator acting on the Standard Model hyperfield, gives rise to matter into antimatter transitions not mediated by any gauge field. These transitions are eliminated by restricting the dependencies of the components of the hyperfield on the extra six dimensions, which appear in this context as a complex triple. "
"We propose, based on ab initio calculations, that the ground state (001) surface of $\alpha$-Ga should be covered by two layers of GaIII, a denser phase which is stable in the bulk only at high pressure and temperature. We discuss how this novel prediction can explain recent STM observations, including anomalous thermal stability of this surface. "
"If p is the probability of a letter of a memoryless source, the length l of the corresponding binary Huffman codeword can be very different from the value -log p. We show that, nevertheless, for a typical letter, l is approximately equal to -log p. More precisely, the probability that l differs from -log p by more than m decreases exponentially with m. "
"Some time ago, Sorkin (1975) reported investigations of the time evolution and initial value problems in Regge calculus, for one triangulation each of the manifolds $R*S^3$ and $R^4$. Here we display the simple, local characteristic of those triangulations which underlies the structure found by Sorkin, and emphasise its general applicability, and therefore the general validity of Sorkin's conclusions. We also make some elementary observations on the resulting structure of the time evolution and initial value problems in Regge calculus, and add some comments and speculations. "
"We develop an analytical diffusion-equation-type approximation scheme for the one-dimensional coagulation reaction A+A->A with partial reaction probability on particle encounters which are otherwise hard-core. The new approximation describes the crossover from the mean-field rate-equation behavior at short times to the universal, fluctuation-dominated behavior at large times. The approximation becomes quantitatively accurate when the system is initially close to the continuum behavior, i.e., for small initial density and fast reaction. For large initial density and slow reaction, lattice effects are nonnegligible for an extended initial time interval. In such cases our approximation provides the correct description of the initial mean-field as well as the asymptotic large-time, fluctuation-dominated behavior. However, the intermediate-time crossover between the two regimes is described only semiquantitatively. "
"We derive here the equation of state for quark matter with a nontrivial vacuum structure in QCD at finite temperature and baryon density. Using thermofield dynamics, the parameters of thermal vacuum and the gluon condensate function are determined through minimisation of the thermodynamic potential, along with a self-consistent determination of the effective gluon and quark masses. The scale parameter for the gluon condensates is related to the SVZ parameter in the context of QCD sum rules at zero temperature. With inclusion of quarks in the thermal vacuum the critical temperature at which the gluon condensate vanishes decreases as compared to that containing only gluons. At zero temperature, we similarly obtain the critical baryon density for the same to be about 0.36 fm$^{-3}$. "
"The statistics of S-matrix fluctuations are numerically investigated on a model for irregular quantum scattering in which a classical chaotic diffusion takes place within the interaction region. Agreement with various random-matrix theoretic predictions is discussed in the various regimes (ballistic, diffusive, localized). "
"Motivated by the evolution of complex bird songs, an abstract imitation game is proposed to study the increase of dynamical complexity: Artificial ""birds"" display a ""song"" time series to each other, and those that imitate the other's song better win the game. With the introduction of population dynamics according to the score of the game and the mutation of parameters for the song dynamics, the dynamics is found to evolve towards the borderline between chaos and a periodic window, after punctuated equilibria. The importance of edge of chaos with topological chaos for complexity is stressed. "
"Traveling waves triggered by a phase slip in coupled map lattices are studied. A local phase slip affects globally the system, which is in strong contrast with kink propagation. Attractors with different velocities coexist, and form quantized bands determined by the number of phase slips. The mechanism and statistical and dynamical characters are studied with the use of spatial asymmetry, basin volume ratio, Lyapunov spectra, and mutual information. If the system size is not far from an integer multiple of the selected wavelength, attractors are tori, while weak chaos remains otherwise, which induces chaotic modulation of waves or a chaotic itinerancy of traveling states. In the itinerancy, the residence time distribution obeys the power law distribution, implying the existence of a long-ranged correlation. Supertransients before the formation of traveling waves are noted in the high nonlinearity regime. In the weaker nonlinearity regime corresponding to the frozen random pattern, we have found fluctuation of domain sizes and Brownian-like motion of domains. Propagation of chaotic domains by phase slips is also found. Relevance of our discoveries to B\'{e}nard convection experiments and possible applications to information processing are briefly discussed. "
"The ""kinematical"" resolution of the $U_A(1)$ problem is proposed. The cancellation of photonic and gluonic anomalies suggested by the t'Hooft consistency principle naturally explains the zero singlet contributions to the first moments of proton and photon spin structure functions. The new sum rule for the photon spin structure function is derived. The strong strong $Q^2$-dependence of the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule is related to the $G_2$ structure function and to the gluonic anomaly. "
"We study the most promising signals for supersymmetry at LEPII in the context of two well motivated supergravity models: (i) the minimal $SU(5)$ supergravity model including the stringent constraints from proton stability and a not too young Universe, and (ii) a recently proposed string-inspired no-scale flipped $SU(5)$ supergravity model. Our computations span the neutralino, chargino, slepton, and Higgs sectors together with their interconnections in this class of models. We find that the number of `mixed' (1-lepton + 2-jets + $\slash{p}$) events occuring in the decay of pair-produced charginos ($\chi^\pm_1$) is quite significant (per ${\cal L}=100\ipb$) for both models and that these predictions do not overlap. That is, if $m_{\chi^\pm_1}<100\GeV$ then LEPII should be able to exclude at least one of the two models. In the no-scale flipped $SU(5)$ model we find that the number of acoplanar di-electron events from selectron pair production should allow for exploration of selectron masses up to the kinematical limit and chargino masses indirectly as high as 150 GeV. We find that the cross section $e^+e^-\to Z^*h$ deviates negligibly from the SM result in the minimal model, whereas it can be as much as $1/3$ lower in the flipped model. The usually neglected invisible mode $h\to\chi^0_1\chi^0_1$ can erode the preferred $h\to 2\,{\rm jets}$ signal by as much as $40\%$ in these models. We conclude that the charged slepton sector is a deeper probe than the chargino/neutralino or Higgs sectors of the flipped $SU(5)$ model at LEPII, while the opposite is true for the minimal $SU(5)$ model where the slepton sector is no probe at all. "
"We extend a recent calculation of the momentum dependence of the $\rho-\omega$ mixing amplitude to the pseudoscalar sector. The $\pi\!-\!\eta$ mixing amplitude is calculated in a hadronic model where the mixing is driven by the neutron-proton mass difference. Closed-form analytic expressions are presented in terms of a few nucleon-meson parameters. The observed momentum dependence of the mixing amplitude is strong enough as to question earlier calculations of charge-symmetry-breaking observables based on the on-shell assumption. The momentum dependence of the $\pi\!-\!\eta$ amplitude is, however, practically identical to the one recently predicted for $\rho-\omega$ mixing. Hence, in this model, the ratio of pseudoscalar to vector mixing amplitudes is, to a good approximation, a constant solely determined from nucleon-meson coupling constants. Furthermore, by selecting these parameters in accordance with charge-symmetry-conserving data and SU(3)-flavor symmetry, we reproduce the momentum dependence of the $\pi\!-\!\eta$ mixing amplitude predicted from chiral perturbation theory. Alternatively, one can use chiral-perturbation-theory results to set stringent limits on the value of the $NN\eta$ coupling constant. "
"We show that low-order g-modes with large enough amplitudes to affect significantly the solar neutrino fluxes would produce surface velocities that are $10^4$ times larger than the observed upper limits and hence are ruled out by existing data. We also demonstrate that any large-amplitude, short-period oscillations that grow on a Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale will require, to affect solar neutrino fluxes, a large amount of energy (for g-modes, $10^9$ times the energy in the observed $p-$ mode oscillations) and a tiny amount of dissipation (for g-modes, $10^{-8}$ the dissipation rate of the $p$-modes). "
"We investigate the phase structure of four-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to Ising spins or Gaussian scalar fields by means of numerical simulations. The quantum gravity part is modelled by the summation over random simplicial manifolds, and the matter fields are located in the center of the 4-simplices, which constitute the building blocks of the manifolds. We find that the coupling between spin and geometry is weak away from the critical point of the Ising model. At the critical point there is clear coupling, which qualitatively agrees with that of gaussian fields coupled to gravity. In the case of pure gravity a transition between a phase with highly connected geometry and a phase with very ``dilute'' geometry has been observed earlier. The nature of this transition seems unaltered when matter fields are included. It was the hope that continuum physics could be extracted at the transition between the two types of geometries. The coupling to matter fields, at least in the form discussed in this paper, seems not to improve the scaling of the curvature at the transition point. "
Many Texo's have been corrected and a reference added. 
We measure the fractal structure of four dimensional simplicial quantum gravity by identifying so-called baby universes. This allows an easy determination of the critical exponent $\g$ connected to the entropy of four-dimensional manifolds. 
"Conventional approaches to supersymmetric model building suffer from several naturalness problems: they do not explain the large hierarchy between the weak scale and the Planck mass, and they require fine tuning to avoid large flavor changing neutral currents and particle electric dipole moments. The existence of models with dynamical supersymmetry breaking, which can explain the hierarchy, has been known for some time, but efforts to build such models have suffered from unwanted axions and difficulties with asymptotic freedom. In this paper, we describe an approach to model building with supersymmetry broken at comparatively low energies which solves these problems, and give a realistic example. "
"Effects on C60 by thermal fluctuations of phonons, misalignment of molecules in a crystal, and other intercalated impurities are simulated by disorder potentials. The SSH model for doped C60 is solved with gaussian bond and site disorders. Polarons and dimerizations in lightly doped cases (C60^{-1,-2}) are relatively stable against disorders, indicated by peak structures in distribution functions of bond length and charge density. "
"We reexamine the $W_{\infty}$ symmetry of the $sl(N)$ Conformal Affine Toda theories. It is shown that it is possible to reduce (nonuniquely) the zero curvature equation to a Lax equation for a first order pseudodifferential oprator, whose coefficients are the generators of the $W_{\infty}$ algebra. This clarifies the known relation between the Conformal Affine Toda theories and the KP hierarchy. A possible correspondence between the matrix models and the Conformal Affine Toda models is discussed. "
"We discuss supersymmetry breakdown in effective supergravities such as emerge in the low-energy limit of superstring theory. Without specifying the precise trigger of the breakdown, we analyse the soft parameters in the Lagrangian of the supersymmetrized Standard Model. "
"We consider a two-parameter $(\bar c, \tilde c)$ family of quantum integrable Hamiltonians for a chain of alternating spins of spin $s=1/2$ and $s=1$. We determine the thermodynamics for low-temperature $T$ and small external magnetic field $H$, with $T << H$. In the antiferromagnetic $(\bar c > 0, \tilde c > 0)$ case, the model has two gapless excitations. In particular, for $\bar c = \tilde c$, the model is conformally invariant and has central charge $c_{vir} = 2$. When one of these parameters is zero, the Bethe Ansatz equations admit an infinite number of solutions with lowest energy. "
"We present a systematic implementation of differential renormalization to all orders in perturbation theory. The method is applied to individual Feynamn graphs written in coordinate space. After isolating every singularity. which appears in a bare diagram, we define a subtraction procedure which consists in replacing the core of the singularity by its renormalized form givenby a differential formula. The organizationof subtractions in subgraphs relies in Bogoliubov's formula, fulfilling the requirements of locality, unitarity and Lorentz invariance. Our method bypasses the use of an intermediate regularization andautomatically delivers renormalized amplitudes which obey renormalization group equations. "
"We determine the characteristic length scale, $L(t)$, in phase ordering kinetics for both scalar and vector fields, with either short- or long-range interactions, and with or without conservation laws. We obtain $L(t)$ consistently by comparing the global rate of energy change to the energy dissipation from the local evolution of the order parameter. We derive growth laws for O(n) models, and our results can be applied to other systems with similar defect structures. "
"We study the ground state properties of the bond alternating $S=1/2$ quantum spin chain whose Hamiltonian is H=\sum_j (S_{2j}^x S_{2j+1}^x +S_{2j}^y S_{2j+1}^y +\lambda S_{2j}^z S_{2j+1}^z ) +\beta \sum_j {\bf S}_{2j-1} \cdot {\bf S}_{2j} . When $\beta=0$, the ground state is a collection of local singlets with a finite excitation gap. In the limit of strong ferromagnetic coupling $\beta \to - \infty$, this is equivalent to the $S=1 \ XXZ$ Hamiltonian. It has several ground state phases in the $\lambda$-$\beta$ plane including the gapful Haldane phase. They are characterized by a full breakdown, partial breakdowns and a non-breakdown of the hidden discrete $Z_2 \times Z_2$ symmetry. The ground state phase diagram is obtained by series expansions. "
"Blue stragglers are natural phenomena in star clusters. They originate through mass transfer in isolated binaries, as well as through encounters between two or more stars, in a complex interplay between stellar dynamics and stellar evolution. While this interplay cannot be modeled quantitatively at present, we will be able to do so in one or two years time. With this prospect, the present paper is written largely as a preview. "
The ground state density matrix for a massless free field is traced over the degrees of freedom residing inside an imaginary sphere; the resulting entropy is shown to be proportional to the area (and not the volume) of the sphere. Possible connections with the physics of black holes are discussed. 
"The authors have recently proposed a ``microcanonical functional integral"" representation of the density of quantum states of the gravitational field. The phase of this real--time functional integral is determined by a ``microcanonical"" or Jacobi action, the extrema of which are classical solutions at fixed total energy, not at fixed total time interval as in Hamilton's action. This approach is fully general but is especially well suited to gravitating systems because for them the total energy can be fixed simply as a boundary condition on the gravitational field. In this paper we describe how to obtain Jacobi's action for general relativity. We evaluate it for a certain complex metric associated with a rotating black hole and discuss the relation of the result to the density of states and to the entropy of the black hole. (Dedicated to Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat in honor of her retirement.) "
"In this paper we generalize some of these results for loop algebras and groups as well as for the Virasoro algebra to the two-dimensional case. We define and study a class of infinite dimensional complex Lie groups which are central extensions of the group of smooth maps from a two dimensional orientable surface without boundary to a simple complex Lie group G. These extensions naturally correspond to complex curves. The kernel of such an extension is the Jacobian of the curve. The study of the coadjoint action shows that its orbits are labelled by moduli of holomorphic principal G-bundles over the curve and can be described in the language of partial differential equations. In genus one it is also possible to describe the orbits as conjugacy classes of the twisted loop group, which leads to consideration of difference equations for holomorphic functions. This gives rise to a hope that the described groups should possess a counterpart of the rich representation theory that has been developed for loop groups. We also define a two-dimensional analogue of the Virasoro algebra associated with a complex curve. In genus one, a study of a complex analogue of Hill's operator yields a description of invariants of the coadjoint action of this Lie algebra. The answer turns out to be the same as in dimension one: the invariants coincide with those for the extended algebra of currents in sl(2). "
A new expansion scheme to evaluate the eigenvalues of the generalized evolution operator (Frobenius-Perron operator) $H_{q}$ relevant to the fluctuation spectrum and poles of the order-$q$ power spectrum is proposed. The ``partition function'' is computed in terms of unstable periodic orbits and then used in a finite pole approximation of the continued fraction expansion for the evolution operator. A solvable example is presented and the approximate and exact results are compared; good agreement is found. 
"For one dimensional maps the trajectory scaling functions is invariant under coordinate transformations and can be used to compute any ergodic average. It is the most stringent test between theory and experiment, but so far it has proven difficult to extract from experimental data. It is shown that the main difficulty is a dephasing of the experimental orbit which can be corrected by reconstructing the dynamics from several time series. From the reconstructed dynamics the scaling function can be accurately extracted. "
"We show that the gravitational field equations derived from an action composed of i) an arbitrary function of the scalar curvature and other scalar fields plus ii) connection-independent kinetic and source terms, are identical whether one chooses nonmetricity to vanish and have non-zero torsion or vice versa. "
"We review some of the basic features of the Kazakov-Migdal model of induced QCD. We emphasize the role of $Z_N$ symmetry in determining the observable properties of the model and also argue that it can be broken explicitly without ruining the solvability of induced QCD in the infinite $N$ limit. We outline the sort of critical behavior which the master field must have in order that the model is still solvable. We also review some aspects of the $D=1$ version of the model where the partition function can be obtained analytically. To be published in the Proceedings of ""Mathematical Physics, String Theory and Quantum Gravity"", Rhakov, Ukraine. October, 1992 "
"Massless $\phi^{4}$-theory is investigated in zero and four space-time dimensions. Path-integral linearisation of the $\phi ^{4}$-interaction defines an effective theory, which is investigated in a loop-expansion around the mean field. In zero dimensions this expansion converges rapidly to the exact potential obtained numerically. In four dimensions its lowest order (mean-field approximation) produces a real and convex effective potential. Two phases are found. In one the renormalisation group improved one-loop effective potential is recovered as the leading contribution near the classical minimum. This phase, however, is unstable. The second (precarious) phase is found to have lower vacuum energy density. In this phase a dynamical mass is generated. The results are renormalisation group invariant. "
"The evolution of nonlinear density fluctuations around the Jeans mass shortly after cosmological recombination is analyzed using a 3D hydrodynamics/dark--matter code. The Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR) exerts Compton friction on free electrons due to peculiar velocities. The dynamics therefore depends strongly on the gas ionization history. Under a variety of ionization conditions and in systems with or without non-baryonic components, the baryons lose angular momentum efficiently and collapse to form a compact optically--thick object which would probably quickly evolve into a massive black hole. Attention is concentrated on elucidating some of the novel physical effects in early cosmological collapses, but ways in which more realistic calculations might be made and in which the scenario could be incorporated into a more complete cosmogonic model are discussed. "
"We have measured the four IR active $C_{60}$ molecular vibrations in $M_{x}C_{60}$ $(M = K, Rb)$ as a function of doping $x$. We observe discontinuous changes in the vibrational spectra showing four distinct phases (presumably $x = 0, 3, 4$, and 6). The $1427cm^{-1}$ and $576cm^{-1}$ modes show the largest changes shifting downward in frequency in four steps as the doping increases. Several new very weak modes are visible in the $x=6$ phase and are possibly Raman modes becoming weakly optically active. We present quantitative fits of the data and calculate the electron-phonon coupling of the $1427cm^{-1}$ IR mode. "
"We consider the behaviour of fermions in the background of instanton-anti\-instanton type configurations. Several different physics problems, from the high energy electroweak interactions to the study of vacuum structure of QCD and of large orders of perturbation theory are related to this problem. The spectrum of the Dirac operator in such a background is studied in detail. We present an approximation for the fermion correlation function when the instanton-anti\-instanton separation ($R$) is large compared to their sizes ($\rho $). The situation when the instanton-anti\-instanton overlap and melt, is studied through the behaviour of the Chern Simons number as a function of $ R/\rho$ and $x_4$. Applying our results to widely discussed cases of fermion-number violation in the electroweak theory, we conclude that there are no theoretical basis for expecting anomalous cross sections to become observable at energies in $10$ TeV region. "
"We show how any integrable 2D QFT enjoys the existence of infinitely many non--abelian {\it conserved} charges satisfying a Yang--Baxter symmetry algebra. These charges are generated by quantum monodromy operators and provide a representation of $q-$deformed affine Lie algebras. We review and generalize the work of de Vega, Eichenherr and Maillet on the bootstrap construction of the quantum monodromy operators to the sine--Gordon (or massive Thirring) model, where such operators do not possess a classical analogue. Within the light--cone approach to the mT model, we explicitly compute the eigenvalues of the six--vertex alternating transfer matrix $\tau(\l)$ on a generic physical state, through algebraic Bethe ansatz. In the thermodynamic limit $\tau(\l)$ turns out to be a two--valued periodic function. One determination generates the local abelian charges, including energy and momentum, while the other yields the abelian subalgebra of the (non--local) YB algebra. In particular, the bootstrap results coincide with the ratio between the two determinations of the lattice transfer matrix. "
"We apply the theory of parton-parton total cross sections at large ``s"", due to Lipatov and collaborators, to compute the inclusive cross section for jets which accompany a large ``s"" parton scattering process. "
The results of a detailed histogram Monte-Carlo study of critical-fluctuation effects on the magnetic-field temperature phase diagram associated with the hexagonal Heisenberg antiferromagnet with weak axial anisotropy are reported. The multiphase point where three lines of continuous transitions merge at the spin-flop boundary exhibits a structure consistent with scaling theory but without the usual umbilicus as found in the case of a bicritical point. 
"We extend the theory of the gauging of classical quadratically nonlinear algebras without a central charge but with a coset structure, to the quantum level. Inserting the minimal anomalies into the classical transformation rules of the currents introduces further quantum corrections to the classical transformation rules of the gauge fields and currents which additively renormalize the structure constants. The corresponding Ward identities are the c -> infinity limit of the full quantum Ward identities, and reveal that the c -> infinity limit of the quantum gauge algebra closes on fields and currents. Two examples are given. "
"We discuss two classes of exact (in $\a'$) string solutions described by conformal sigma models. They can be viewed as two possibilities of constructing a conformal model out of the non-conformal one based on the metric of a $D$-dimensional homogeneous $G/H$ space. The first possibility is to introduce two extra dimensions (one space-like and one time-like) and to impose the null Killing symmetry condition on the resulting $2+D$ dimensional metric. In the case when the ``transverse"" model is $n=2$ supersymmetric and the $G/H$ space is K\""ahler-Einstein the resulting metric-dilaton background can be found explicitly. The second possibility - which is realised in the sigma models corresponding to $G/H$ conformal theories - is to deform the metric, introducing at the same time a non-trivial dilaton and antisymmetric tensor backgrounds. The expressions for the metric and dilaton in this case are derived using the operator approach in which one identifies the equations for marginal operators of conformal theory with the linearised (near a background) expressions for the `$\b$-functions'. Equivalent results are then reproduced in the direct field-theoretical approach based on computing first the effective action of the $G/H$ gauged WZW model and then solving for the $2d$ gauge field. Both the bosonic and the supersymmetric cases are discussed. ( To be published in the Proceedings of the 26 Workshop ``From Superstrings to Supergravity"", Erice, 5-12 December,1992.) "
A method for removing fermion doublers in anomaly free chiral gauge theories on the lattice is proposed. It is proven that the resulting continuum theory is gauge invariant and does not require noninvariant counterterms of fine tuning of parameters. 
"We investigate SU(2) gauge theory in a constant chromomagnetic field in three dimensions both in the continuum and on the lattice. Using a variational method to stabilize the unstable modes, we evaluate the vacuum energy density in the one-loop approximation. We compare our theoretical results with the outcomes of the numerical simulations. "
"We study the random walk representation of the two-point function in statistical mechanics models near the critical point. Using standard scaling arguments we show that the critical exponent $\nu$ describing the vanishing of the physical mass at the critical point is equal to $\nu_\theta/ d_w$. $d_w$ is the Hausdorff dimension of the walk. $\nu_\theta$ is the exponent describing the vanishing of the energy per unit length of the walk at the critical point. For the case of O(N) models, we show that $\nu_\theta=\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is the crossover exponent known in the context of field theory. This implies that the Hausdorff dimension of the walk is $\varphi/\nu$ for O(N) models. "
"We construct solvable models on the honeycomb lattice by combining three faces of the square lattice solvable models into a hexagon face. These models contain two independent, anisotropy controlling, spectral parameters and their transfer matrices with different spectral parameters commute with each other. At the critical point, the finite-size scaling of the transfer matrix spectrum for the honeycomb lattice models is written in terms of the quantities obtained from the finite-size scaling of the square lattice solvable models. We study in detail the phase transition properties of two models based on the interacting hard square model and the magnetic hard square model, respectively. The models, in general, can be extended to the IRF version of the Z-invariant models of Baxter. "
"We use the results of Maher {\em et al.\/} (preceding paper) to construct the matrix of $j=0$ partial-wave two-body and $2\rightarrow3$ scattering amplitudes for the scattering of longitudinally polarized gauge bosons $W_L^\pm$, $Z_L$ and Higgs bosons $H$ correct to two loops in the high-energy, heavy-Higgs limit $\sqrt{s}\gg M_H\gg M_W$. We show explicitly that the energy dependence of the $2\rightarrow2$ amplitudes can be completely absorbed into a running quartic Higgs coupling $\lambda_s= \lambda_s(s,M_H^2)$ and factors which involve small anomalous dimensions and remain near unity. After diagonalizing the matrix of partial-wave amplitudes, we use an Argand-diagram analysis to show that the elastic scattering amplitudes are approximately unitary and weakly interacting for $\lambda_s\alt2.3$, but that three-loop corrections are necessary to restore unitarity for larger values of $\lambda_s$. That is, the interactions in the Higgs sector of the standard model are effectively strong with respect to the perturbative expansion for $\lambda_s\agt2.3$. The bound $\lambda_s\alt2.3$ for a weakly interacting theory translates to a physical Higgs mass $M_H\alt380$ GeV if the bound is to hold for energies up to a few TeV, or $M_H\leq155$ GeV in perturbatively unified theories with mass scales of order $10^{16}$ GeV. "
"These are lectures presented at the summer course on ``Low Dimensional Quantum Field Theories for Condensed Matter Physicists'', 24 Aug. to 4 Sep. 1992, Trieste, Italy. I review recent work, performed in collaboration primarily with N. Read and Jinwu Ye, on the properties of quantum antiferromagnets in two dimensions. The emphasis is on the properties of the antiferromagnet in states which do not have any long-range magnetic order. The universal spin dynamics in the quantum critical region of number of frustrated and random antiferromagnets is studied; implications for neutron scattering experiments in the lightly-doped cuprates are noted. The nature of the quantum-disordered phase of non-random frustrated antiferromagnets is examined in some detail: the states found have ({\em i\/}) collinear spin correlations, spin-Peierls or valence-bond-solid order, and confined spinons, order and confined spinons or ({\em ii\/}) coplanar spin correlations, no spin-Peierls order and deconfined bosonic spinons.

"We investigate the dynamical evolution of a thermodynamically unstable crystal surface into a hill-and-valley structure. We demonstrate that, for quasi one-dimensional ordering, the equation of motion maps exactly to the modified Cahn-Hilliard equation describing spinodal decomposition. Orderings in two dimensions follow the dynamics of continuum clock models. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of crystalline anisotropy and the interaction between phase boundaries in controlling the long time dynamics. We establish that the hill-and-valley pattern coarsens logarithmically in time for quasi one-dimensional orderings. For two-dimensional orderings, a power-law growth $L(t)\sim t^n$ of the typical pattern size is attained with exponent $n\approx 0.23$ and $n\approx 0.13$, for the two ordering mechanisms dominated by evaporation-condensation and by surface-diffusion respectively. "
"Several schemes to introduce finite width effects to reactions involving unstable elementary particles are given and the differences between them are investigated. The effects of the different schemes is investigated numerically for $W$ pair production. In $e^+e^-\to W^+W^-$ we find that the effect of the non-resonant graphs cannot be neglected for $\sqrt{s}\geq400\GeV$. There is no difference between the various schemes to add these to the resonant graphs away from threshold, although some violate gauge invariance. On the other hand, in the reaction $\gamma\gamma\to W^+W^-$ the effect of the non-resonant graphs is large everywhere, due to the $t$-channel pole. However, even requiring that the outgoing lepton is observable ($p_\perp > .02\sqrt{s}$) reduces the contribution to about 1\%. Again, the scheme dependence is negligible here. "
"We present a new scalable algorithm for short-range molecular dynamics simulations on distributed memory MIMD multicomputer based on a message-passing multi-cell approach. We have implemented the algorithm on the Connection Machine 5 (CM-5) and demonstrate that meso-scale molecular dynamics with more than $10^8$ particles is now possible on massively parallel MIMD computers. Typical runs show single particle update-times of $0.15 \mu s$ in 2 dimensions (2D) and approximately $1 \mu s$ in 3 dimensions (3D) on a 1024 node CM-5 without vector units, corresponding to more than 1.8 GFlops overall performance. We also present a scaling equation which agrees well with actually observed timings. "
"We discuss the conditions under which the BRST operator of a $W$-string can be written as the sum of two operators that are separately nilpotent and anticommute with each other. We illustrate our results with the example of the non-critical $W_3$-string. Furthermore, we apply our results to make a conjecture about a relationship between the spectrum of a non-critical $W_n$-string and a $W_{n-1}$-string. "
"We study the delocalization by bulk randomness of a single flux line (FL) from an extended defect, such as a columnar pin or twin plane. In three dimensions, the FL is always bound to a planar defect, while there is an unpinning transition from a columnar pin. Transfer matrix simulations confirm this picture, and indicate that the divergence of the localization length from the columnar defect is governed by a liberation exponent $\nu_\perp =1.3 \pm 0.6$, for which a ``mean-field'' estimate gives $\nu_\perp \approx 0.78$. The results, and their extensions, are compared to other theories. The effects may be observable in thin samples close to $H_{c1}$. "
"We calculate the complete matrix of two-body scattering amplitudes for the scattering of longitudinally polarized gauge bosons $W_L^\pm$, $Z_L$ and Higgs bosons to two loops in the high-energy, heavy-Higgs limit $\sqrt{s}\gg M_H\gg M_W$. Use of the Goldstone boson equivalence theorem reduces the problem to one involving only the scalar fields $w^\pm$, $z$ (the Goldstone bosons of the original theory) and the Higgs boson. Renormalization of the scattering amplitudes requires the calculation of the self-energy functions $\Pi _i^0(M_i^2)$, the renormalization constants $Z_i$, and the bare quartic Higgs coupling $\lambda _0$ to two loops. The results will be useful in other calculations. To facilitate the calculations, we introduce a powerful new technique for evaluating integrals over Feynman parameters in dimensional regularization which is based on a Barnes' type representation of the binomial expansion. We also collect some useful integrals which extend the tables given by Devoto and Duke. "
"Based upon the formalism of conformal field theory with a boundary, we give a description of the boundary effect on fully developed two dimensional turbulence. Exact one and two point velocity correlation functions and energy power spectrum confined in the upper half plane are obtained using the image method. This result enables us to address the infrared problem of the theory of conformal turbulence. "
"We show that in heterotic string theory compactified on a six dimensional torus, the lower bound (Bogomol'nyi bound) on the dyon mass is invariant under the SL(2,Z) transformation that interchanges strong and weak coupling limits of the theory. Elementary string excitations are also shown to satisfy this lower bound. Finally, we identify specific monopole solutions that are related via the strong-weak coupling duality transformation to some of the elementary particles saturating the Bogomol'nyi bound, and these monopoles are shown to have the same mass and degeneracy of states as the corresponding elementary particles. "
"The high-energy Regge behavior of gauge theories is studied via the formalism of Analytic Multi-Regge Theory. Perturbative results for spontaneously-broken theories are first organised into reggeon diagrams. Unbroken gauge theories are studied via a reggeon diagram infra-red analysis of symmetry restoration. Massless fermions play a crucial role and the case of QCD involves the Super-Critical Pomeron as an essential intermediate stage. An introductory review of the build up of transverse momentum diagrams and reggeon diagrams from leading log calculations in gauge theories is presented first. It is then shown that the results closely reproduce the general structure for multi-regge amplitudes derived in Part I of the article, allowing the construction of general reggeon diagrams for spontaneously-broken theories. Next it is argued that, with a transverse-momentum cut-off, unbroken gauge theories can be reached through an infra-red limiting process which successively decouples fundamental representation Higgs fields . The first infra-red limit studied is the restoration of SU(2) gauge symmetry. The analysis is dominated by the exponentiation of divergences imposed by Reggeon Unitarity and the contribution of massless quarks ... "
"The two dimensional dilaton gravity with the cosmological term and with an even number of matter fields minimally coupled to the gravity is considered. The exact solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation are obtained in an explicit functional form, which contain an arbitrary holomorphic function of the matter fields. "
"A recent proposal for a background independent open string field theory is studied in detail for a class of backgrounds that correspond to general quadratic boundary interactions on the world-sheet. A short-distance cut-off is introduced to formulate the theory with a finite number of local and potentially unrenormalizable boundary couplings. It is shown that renormalization of the boundary couplings makes both the world-sheet partition function and the string field action finite and cut-off independent, although the resulting string field action has an unpalatable dependence on the leading unrenormalizable coupling. "
"We construct a model in which four dimensional chiral fermions arise on the boundaries of a five dimensional lattice with free boundary conditions in the fifth direction. The physical content is similar to Kaplan's model of domain wall fermions, yet the present construction has several technical advantages. We discuss some aspects of perturbation theory, as well as possible applications of the model both for lattice QCD and for the on-going attempts to construct a lattice chiral gauge theory. "
"Computed flame motion through and between swirling eddys exhibits a maximum advancement rate which is related to the time duration of flame motion between eddys. This eddy spatial structure effect upon the apparent turbulent flame speed appears to be similar to the square-root dependence observed in wrinkled flamelet data. The rate-limiting behavior at one eddy length-scale can be removed by inclusion of smaller eddys which reside between the larger eddys. This large-eddy, small-eddy concept yields a recursion relation and repeated functional iteration can be done to approximate a desired flame speed relation. As an example, an iteration to produce $S_T \ln S_T = u'$ is given for the range of $u'$ observed in liquid flames. Currently, the iteration process is a post-diction of flame speed, but if a universality can be developed, then a predictive theory of turbulent flame propagation might be achieved. "
"The paper introduces a new geometric interpretation of the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations introduced in 1991 by I.Frenkel and N.Reshetikhin. It turns out that these equations can be linked to certain holomorphic vector bundles on the N-th Cartesian power of an elliptic curve. These bundles are naturally constructed by a gluing procedure from a system of trigonometric quantum affine $R$-matrices. Meromorphic solutions of the quantum KZ equations are interpreted as sections of such a bundle. This interpretation is an analogue of the interpretation of solutions of the classical KZ equations as sections of a flat vector bundle. Matrix elements of intertwiners between representations of the quantum affine algebra correspond to regular (holomorphic) sections. The vector bundle obtained from the quantum KZ system is topologically nontrivial. Its topology can be completely described in terms of crystal bases, using the crystal limit ``q goes to 0''. In the case N=2, this bundle is is essentially a bundle on an elliptic curve which is shown to be semistable (for the case of quantum sl(2)) if the parameters take generic values. The proof makes use of the crystal limit ``q goes to 0''. Finally, we give a vector bundle interpretation of the generalized quantum KZ equations for arbitrary affine root systems defined recently by Cherednik. "
"We propose a new scenario in a class of superstring derived standard--like models that explains the suppression of the left--handed neutrino masses. Due to nonrenormalizable terms and the breaking of the $U(1)_{Z^\prime}$ symmetry a generalized see--saw mechanism takes place. Contrary to the traditional see--saw mechanism in GUTs, the see--saw scale and the right--handed neutrino mass scale are suppressed relative to the $U(1)_{Z^\prime}$ breaking scale. "
"This study presents a simplified approach to studying the dynamics of global texture collapse. We derive equations of motion for a spherically symmetric field configuration using a two parameter ansatz. Then we analyse the effective potential for the resulting theory to understand possible trajectories of the field configuration in the parameter space of the ansatz. Numerical results are given for critical winding and collapse time in spatially flat non-expanding, and flat expanding universes. In addition, the open non-expanding and open-expanding cases are studied. "
"The energy density in Fulling-Rindler vacuum, which is known to be negative ""everywhere"" is shown to be positive and singular on the horizons in such a fashion as to guarantee the positivity of the total energy. The mechanism of compensation is displayed in detail. "
"Using an analytic model we show that the predictions of the cosmic string model for the peculiar velocities and the microwave background (MBR) anisotropy depend on similar combinations of string evolution parameters. Normalizing from the COBE detection of MBR anisotropy, and for certain reasonable values of string network evolution parameters, we find that the magnitude of predicted velocity flows is in good agreement with observations on small scales but is inconsistent with observations on large scales ($ > 50 h^{-1}$Mpc). The Cosmic Mach Number obtained from the cosmic string scenario is found to depend on a single network evolution parameter and is consistent with observations on scales $5h^{-1}$Mpc to $20h^{-1}$Mpc. "
"We discuss a model in which the Standard Model (SM) Higgs sector has been extended by additional real and complex triplets. The $\rho\approx 1$ constraint is satisfied by restricting the potential to have an enlarged $\hisym $ global symmetry. This is fine tuning, which leads to a decreased predictability in next-to-leading order. In this model, however, the triplet vacuum expectation values may give the dominating contribution to the gauge boson masses. Using a renormalization group argument we constrain this region of the parameter space. Another interesting feature of this model is that one of the neutral scalars doesn't couple to the fermion sector at tree level and therefore could have a relatively large branching ratio to $2\gamma $'s. It is coupled, however, to the $Z$-boson and therefore it could be produced at LEP via the standard $e^+e^-\rightarrow Z\phi$ mechanism with rates comparable to the ones of the Standard Model. "
"Quantum filtering of the ejectile wave packet from hard $ep$ scattering on bound nucleons puts stringent constraints on the onset of color transparency in $(e,e'p)$ reactions in nuclei at moderate energies. Based on multiple-scattering theory, we derive a novel formula for nuclear transparency and discuss its energy dependence in terms of a color transparency sum rule. "
"We calculate the one-loop effective potential of a self-interacting scalar field on the spacetime of the form $\reals^2\times H^2/\Gamma$. The Selberg trace formula associated with a co-compact discrete group $\Gamma$ in $PSL(2,\reals )$ (hyperbolic and elliptic elements only) is used. The closed form for the one-loop unrenormalized and renormalized effective potentials is given. The influence of non-trivial topology on curvature induced phase transitions is also discussed. "
"This bibliography attempts to give a comprehensive overview of all the literature related to the Ashtekar variables. The original version was compiled by Peter Huebner in 1989, and it has been subsequently updated by Gabriela Gonzalez and Bernd Bruegmann. Information about additional literature, new preprints, and especially corrections are always welcome. "
"A general technique is outlined for investigating supersymmetry properties of a charged spin-$\half$ quantum particle in time-varying electromagnetic fields. The case of a time-varying uniform magnetic induction is examined and shown to provide a physical realization of a supersymmetric quantum-mechanical system. Group-theoretic methods are used to factorize the relevant Schr\""odinger equations and obtain eigensolutions. The supercoherent states for this system are constructed. "
"We consider single production of leptoquarks (LQ's) at $e\gamma$ colliders, for two values of the centre-of-mass energy, $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV and 1 TeV. LQ's with masses essentially up to the kinematic limit can be seen, even for couplings as weak as $O(10^{-3})$-$O(10^{-2})\alpha_{em}$. It is possible to detect LQ's of mass greater than $\sqrt{s}$ by looking for signals of virtual LQ production in $e\gamma\to e q{\overline q}$. "
I discuss the quantum instability of an electric field in a theory of open strings. 
"We study the Liouville theory on a Riemann surface of genus g by means of their associated Drinfeld--Sokolov linear systems. We discuss the cohomological properties of the monodromies of these systems. We identify the space of solutions of the equations of motion which are single--valued and local and explicitly represent them in terms of Krichever--Novikov oscillators. Then we discuss the operator structure of the quantum theory, in particular we determine the quantum exchange algebras and find the quantum conditions for univalence and locality. We show that we can extend the above discussion to $sl_n$ Toda theories. "
"We consider source-free electromagnetic fields in spacetimes possessing a non-null Killing vector field, $\xi^a$. We assume further that the electromagnetic field tensor, $F_{ab}$, is invariant under the action of the isometry group induced by $\xi^a$. It is proved that whenever the two potentials associated with the electromagnetic field are functionally independent the entire content of Maxwell's equations is equivalent to the relation $\n^aT_{ab}=0$. Since this relation is implied by Einstein's equation we argue that it is enough to solve merely Einstein's equation for these electrovac spacetimes because the relevant equations of motion will be satisfied automatically. It is also shown that for the exceptional case of functionally related potentials $\n^aT_{ab}=0$ implies along with one of the relevant equations of motion that the complementary equation concerning the electromagnetic field is satisfied. "
"This paper is an application of the ideas of the Born-Oppenheimer (or slow/fast) approximation in molecular physics and of the Isaacson (or short-wave) approximation in classical gravity to the canonical quantization of a perturbed minisuperspace model of the kind examined by Halliwell and Hawking. Its aim is the clarification of the role of the semiclassical approximation and the backreaction in such a model. Approximate solutions of the quantum model are constructed which are not semiclassical, and semiclassical solutions in which the quantum perturbations are highly excited. "
"We present numerical solutions of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations by two methods; spectral and the novel Lattice Boltzmann Equation (LBE) scheme. Very good agreement is found for global quantities as well as energy spectra. The LBE scheme is, indeed, providing reasonably accurate solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with an isothermal equation of state, in the nearly incompressible limit. Relaxation to a previously reported ``sinh-Poisson'' state is also observed for both runs. "
"A solution of effective string theory in four dimensions is presented which admits interpretation of a rotating black cosmic string. It is constructed by tensoring the three dimensional black hole, extended with the Kalb-Ramond axion, with a flat direction. The physical interpretation of the solution is discussed, with special attention on the axion, which is found to play a role very similar to a Higgs field. Finally, it is pointed out that the solution represents an exact WZWN $\sigma$ model on the string world sheet, to all orders in the inverse string tension $\alpha'$. "
"The smallness of fermion masses and mixing angles has recently been been attributed to approximate global $U(1)$ symmetries, one for each fermion type. The parameters associated with these symmetry breakings are estimated here directly from observed masses and mixing angles. It turns out that although flavor changing reaction rates may be acceptably small in electroweak theories with several scalar doublets without imposing any special symmetries on the scalars themselves, such theories generically yield too much CP violation in the neutral kaon mass matrix. Hence in these theories CP must also be a good approximate symmetry. Such models provide an alternative mechanism for CP violation and have various interesting phenomenological features. "
"The convergence properties of cycle expanded periodic orbit expressions for the spectra of classical and semiclassical time evolution operators have been studied for the open three disk billiard. We present evidence that both the classical and the semiclassical Selberg zeta function have poles. Applying a Pad\'{e} approximation on the expansions of the full Euler products, as well as on the individual dynamical zeta functions in the products, we calculate the leading poles and the zeros of the improved expansions with the first few poles removed. The removal of poles tends to change the simple linear exponential convergence of the Selberg zeta functions to an $\exp\{-n^{3/2}\}$ decay in the classical case and to an $\exp\{-n^2\}$ decay in the semiclassical case. The leading poles of the $j$th dynamical zeta function are found to equal the leading zeros of the $j+1$th one: However, in contrast to the zeros, which are all simple, the poles seem without exception to be {\em double}\/. The poles are therefore in general {\em not}\/ completely cancelled by zeros, which has earlier been suggested. The only complete cancellations occur in the classical Selberg zeta function between the poles (double) of the first and the zeros (squared) of the second dynamical zeta function. Furthermore, we find strong indications that poles are responsible for the presence of spurious zeros in periodic orbit quantized spectra and that these spectra can be greatly improved by removing the leading poles, e.g.\ by using the Pad\'{e} technique. "
"The partition function corresponding to the ""polytopic"" action, a new action for the gravitational interaction which we have proposed recently, is computed in the simplest two-dimensional geometries of genus zero and one. The functional integral over the Liouville field is approximated by an ordinary integral over the constant zero mode. We study the dependence on both the coupling constant and the cosmological constant, and compare with recent scaling results in standard 2D quantum gravity. "
"The status of solar neutrino experiments and their implications for both nonstandard astrophysics ({\it e.g.,} cool sun models) and nonstandard neutrino properties ({\it e.g.,} MSW conversions) are discussed. Assuming that all of the experiments are correct, the relative rates observed by Kamiokande and Homestake are hard to account for by a purely astrophysical solution, while MSW conversions can describe all of the data. Assuming the standard solar model, there are two allowed regions for MSW conversions into $\nu_\mu$ or $\nu_\tau$, with the non-adiabatic solution giving a better fit than the large angle. For conversions into sterile neutrinos there is only a nonadiabatic solution. Allowing both MSW conversions and nonstandard astrophysics, the data simultaneously determine the temperature of the core of the sun to within five percent, consistent with the standard solar model prediction. The implications of the atmospheric $\nu_\mu/\nu_e$ ratio and of a hot component of the dark matter are briefly discussed, and the expectations of theoretical models motivated by grand unification are summarized. "
"The effective action of a (1+2)-dimensional defect is obtained as an expansion in powers of the thickness.Considering non-straight solutions as the zero order term, the corrections to the Nambu action are found to depend on the curvature scalar and on the gaussian curvature . "
"In the particles produced in a nuclear collision undergo collective flow, the reaction plane can in principle be determined through a global event analysis. We show here that collective flow can be identified by evaluating the reaction plane independently in two separate rapidity intervals, and studying the correlation between the two results. We give an analytical expression for the correlation function between the two planes as a function of their relative angle. We also discuss how this correlation function is related to the anisotropy of the transverse momentum distribution. Email contact: ollie@amoco.saclay.cea.fr "
Recent developments in the semiclassical analysis of chaotic systems are reviewed and illustrated for Wigner's time delay in elastic scattering of a point particle from three disks in the plane. The convergence of the cycle expanded periodic orbit expression for Wigners time delay is demonstrated. Different regimes in form factor (the Fourier transform of the two point correlation function) of the semiclassical time delay are identified and their relation to Berry's semiclassical theory of the spectral rigidity are discussed. 
"Using the concept developed in earlier papers, that the cosmic rays originate in three different main sites, a) the normal supernova explosions into the interstellar medium, b) the supernova explosions into a stellar wind, and c) powerful radio galaxies, we demonstrate in this paper that the spectrum and chemical abundances above $10^4$ GeV can be well understood. Using existing data on the chemical composition of cosmic rays near TeV energies as a constraint, we adjust the parameters of the model to fit the shower size data from the Akeno experiment; this is necessary since the derivation of an all particle spectrum involves an assumption about the chemical composition of the cosmic rays and so we have to fit the shower size data first and then derive the all particle spectrum. We present a successful fit to the shower size data which allows us to draw three main conclusions: a) For most of the energy range above $10^5$ GeV the wind explosions can account for both chemical composition and spectrum including the knee feature, b) the highest particle energies required from the stellar wind explosions imply a magnetic field in the preexisting stellar wind of at least $3$ Gauss at a fiducial distance of $10^{14}$ cm, c) the chemical abundances above $10^5$ GeV are dominated by heavy nuclei such as Neon and higher. The bump observed in the all particle spectrum below the knee gets weakened with the proper treatment of the energy dependent chemical composition. For high energies we obtain an estimate of the extragalactic proton flux. "
"It is argued that the strong energy dependence of the $p\, d \rightarrow \,^{3\!}H\!e\, \eta$ cross section near threshold is due to a final state interaction between the $\eta$ meson and the $^3$He nucleus. The large scattering length that this implies is in accord with optical potential predictions and is evidence for a nearby virtual `$\!$`bound'$\!$' state in the $\eta^3$He system. This model suggests that sharp structures should also be seen close to production thresholds on other light nuclei. "
We study fermionic excitations in a cold ultrarelativistic plasma. We construct explicitly the quantum states associated with the two branches which develop in the excitation spectrum as the chemical potential is raised. The collective nature of the long wavelength excitations is clearly exhibited. Email contact: ollie@amoco.saclay.cea.fr 
We show the possibility and the uniqueness of polar decomposition of elements of arbitrary AW*-algebras inside them. We prove that spectral decomposition of normal elements of normal AW*-algebras is possible and unique inside them. The possibility of spectral decomposition of normal elements does not depend on the normality of the AW*-algebra under consideration. 
"We examine whether observable majoron emission in double beta decay can be compatible with the big-bang nucleosynthesis (NS) and the observed neutrino flux from SN1987A. It is found that the NS upper bound on $^4$He abundance implies that the majoron-neutrino Yukawa coupling constant $g\leq 9\times 10^{-6}$ and its maximal value is allowed only when the scalar quartic coupling constant $\lambda$ is extremely small, $\lambda\leq 100g^2$. It is also observed that, although quite less restrictive, SN1987A also provides independent constraints on coupling constants. "
"Four-dimensional strings with the standard model gauge group $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$ give model-dependent predictions for the tree level weak mixing-angle. In the presence of an extra pseudo-anomalous gauged- ${U(1)}_X$, the value of the weak angle may be computed purely in terms of the charges of the massless fermions of the theory, independently of the details of the massive string sector. I present the simplest such $ {U(1)}_X$ which leads to the canonical result $sin^2\theta _W=3/8$ in the supersymmetric standard model. This is a sort of gauged Peccei-Quinn symmetry which requires the presence of just the minimal set of Higgs doublets and forbids dimension-four $B$ and $L$-violating terms. In this approach the cancellation of the $U(1)_X$ anomalies through a Green-Schwarz mechanism plays a crucial role. In a different context (that of non-string low-energy supersymmetric models) I briefly discuss wether this type of anomaly cancellation mechanism could be of phenomenological relevance close to the electroweak scale. (Talk at the 23-th Workshop of the INFN Eloisatron Project on Properties of Susy particles, Erice, October 1992) "
Associated production of $J/\psi$ and a $\gamma$ has recently been proposed as clean probe of the gluon distribution. The same mechanism can be used to probe the polarized gluon content of the proton in polarized proton-proton collisions. We study $J/\psi + \gamma$ production at both polarized fixed target and polarized collider energies. 
"We study local energy minima of twenty(L-alanine). The minima are generated using high-temperature Molecular Dynamics and Chain-Growth Monte Carlo simulations, with subsequent minimization. We find that the lower-energy configurations are $ \alpha $-helices for a wide range of dielectric constant values $ (\epsilon = 1,10,80), $ and that there is no noticeable difference between the distribution of energy minima in $ \phi \psi $ space for different values of $ \epsilon . $ Ultrametricity tests show that lower-energy $ (\alpha $ -helical) $ \epsilon =1 $ configurations form a set which is ultrametric to a certain degree, providing evidence for the presence of fine structure among those minima. We put forward a heuristic argument for this fine structure. We also find evidence for ultrametricity of a different kind among $ \epsilon =10 $ and $ \epsilon =80 $ energy minima. We analyze the distribution of lengths of $ \alpha $-helical portions among the minimized configurations and find a persistence phenomenon for the $ \epsilon =1 $ ones, in qualitative agreement with previous studies of critical lengths.

We consider a biparametric family of BRS invariant regularization methods of SU(N) Chern-Simons theory (the parameters defining the family taking arbitrary values in $\RR^2$) and show that the shift $k\to k + sign(k) N$ of the Chern-Simons parameter $k$ occurs for arbitrary values of the family defining parameters. This supports irrefutably the conjecture that the shift of $k$ is universal for BRS invariant regulators. 
"The two--neutron separation energy of $^6$He has been reproduced for the first time in a realistic parameter--free microscopic multicluster model comprising the $\alpha +n+n$ and $t+t$ clusterizations, with $\alpha$ cluster breathing excitations included. The contribution of the $t+t$ channel is substantial. A very thick (0.85 fm) neutron halo has been found in full agreement with the results of the latest phenomenological analysis. "
We present a new supersymmetric integrable model: the $N=2$ superconformal affine Liouville theory. It interpolates between the $N=2$ super Liouville and $N=2$ super sine-Gordon theories and possesses a Lax representation on the complex affine Kac-Moody superalgebra ${\hat {sl(2| 2)^{(1)}}}$. We show that the higher spin $W_{1+\infty}$-type symmetry algebra of ordinary conformal affine Liouville theory extends to a $N=2\; W_{1/2 + \infty}$-type superalgebra. 
"The initial bifurcations in rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection are studied in the range of dimensionless rotation rate $0 < \Omega < 2150$ for an aspect-ratio-2.5 cylindrical cell. We used simultaneous optical shadowgraph, heat transport and local temperature measurements to determine the stability and characteristics of the azimuthally-periodic wall convection state. We also show that the second transition corresponds to the onset of bulk convection. Our results for critical Rayleigh numbers, precession frequencies and critical mode numbers agree well with theoretical results. The dynamics of the wall convection state can be described by a complex Ginzburg-Landau amplitude equation. "
"We analyze the breakdown of SUSY GUTs driven by Nambu--Jona--Lasinio condensates. Starting with the most general gauge invariant and pure K\""ahlerian Lagrangian up to quartic order we solve the one loop gap equation and determine the breaking direction. This is done for various classes of groups and spectra of fundamental particles which especially cover the most promising unifying groups $SU(5)$, $SO(10)$ and $E_6$. Heavy masses for the fundamental as well as for the composite particles are calculated. The results are used to single out candidates which may lead to an acceptable low energy theory. In these models we discuss some phenomenological aspects and point out the difficulties in constructing phenomenological viable theories in our scenario. "
We investigate actions for dynamically triangulated random surfaces that consist of a gaussian or area term plus the {\it modulus} of the gaussian curvature and compare their behavior with both gaussian plus extrinsic curvature and ``Steiner'' actions. 
We determine the phenomenological cluster--cluster interactions of the algebraic model corresponding to the most often used effective two--nucleon forces for the $^{16}$O + $\alpha$ system. 
The partition function of the $4D$ lattice Abelian Higgs theory is represented as the sum over world sheets of Nielsen--Olesen strings. The creation and annihilation operators of the strings are constructed. The topological long--range interaction of the strings and charged particles is shown to exist; it is proportional to the linking number of the string world sheet and particle world trajectory. 
"String configurations with nonzero winding number describe soliton string states. We compute the Veneziano amplitude for the scattering of arbitrary winding states and show that in the large radius limit the strings always scatter trivially and with no change in the individual winding numbers of the strings. In this limit, then, these states scatter as true solitons. "
"The full non-linear structure of the action and transformation rules for $\W_N$-gravity coupled to matter are obtained from a non-linear truncation of those for $w_ \infty$ gravity. The geometry of the construction is discussed, and it is shown that the defining equations become linear after a twistor-like transform. "
"The role in string theory of manifolds of complex dimension $D_{crit} + 2(Q-1)$ and positive first Chern class is described. In order to be useful for string theory, the first Chern class of these spaces has to satisfy a certain relation. Because of this condition the cohomology groups of such manifolds show a specific structure. A group that is particularly important is described by $(D_{crit} + Q-1, Q-1)$--forms because it is this group which contains the higher dimensional counterpart of the holomorphic $(D_{crit}, 0)$--form that figures so prominently in Calabi--Yau manifolds. It is shown that the higher dimensional manifolds do not, in general, have a unique counterpart of this holomorphic form of rank $D_{crit}$. It is also shown that these manifolds lead, in general, to a number of additional modes beyond the standard Calabi--Yau spectrum. This suggests that not only the dilaton but also the other massless string modes, such as the antisymmetric torsion field, might be relevant for a possible stringy interpretation. "
"Review talk presented at the Texas/PASCOS Symposium, Berkeley, CA, Dec 1992. We review the status of experiments and ideas relevant for the detection of the dark matter which is suspected to be the dominant constituent of the Universe. Great progress is being made and the chances are non-negligible that one of the many currently in-progress experiments will discover the nature of the dark matter. We discuss the main dark matter candidates, and review the experiments relevant to each of them. "
The cosmological and astrophysical implications of a shadow matter model which could also have interesting experimental consequences are examined. The model has identical microphysics for both the ordinary and shadow worlds but requires a macroscopic asymmetry from nucleosynthesis constraints. It is proposed that this macroscopic asymmetry can be generated at the quark-hadron phase transition. 
"Nonlocal regularization of QED is shown to possess an axial anomaly of the same form as other regularization schemes. The Noether current is explicitly constructed and the symmetries are shown to be violated, whereas the identities constructed when one properly considers the contribution from the path integral measure are respected. We also discuss the barrier to quantizing the fully gauged chiral invariant theory, and consequences. "
"For the $q$-deformed canonical commutation relations $a(f)a^\dagger(g) = (1-q)\,\langle f,g\rangle{\bf1}+q\,a^\dagger(g)a(f)$ for $f,g$ in some Hilbert space ${\cal H}$ we consider representations generated from a vector $\Omega$ satisfying $a(f)\Omega=\langle f,\phi\rangle\Omega$, where $\phi\in{\cal H}$. We show that such a representation exists if and only if $\Vert\phi\Vert\leq1$. Moreover, for $\Vert\phi\Vert<1$ these representations are unitarily equivalent to the Fock representation (obtained for $\phi=0$). On the other hand representations obtained for different unit vectors $\phi$ are disjoint. We show that the universal C*-algebra for the relations has a largest proper, closed, two-sided ideal. The quotient by this ideal is a natural $q$-analogue of the Cuntz algebra (obtained for $q=0$). We discuss the Conjecture that, for $d<\infty$, this analogue should, in fact, be equal to the Cuntz algebra itself. In the limiting cases $q=\pm1$ we determine all irreducible representations of the relations, and characterize those which can be obtained via coherent states. "
We test the effectiveness of the multicanonical algorithm for the tertiary structure prediction of peptides and proteins. As a simple example we study Met-enkephalin. The lowest-energy conformation obtained agrees with that determined by other methods such as Monte Carlo simulated annealing. But unlike to simulated annealing the relationship to the canonical ensemble remains exactly controlled. Thermodynamic quantities at various temperature can be calculated from one run. 
"We consider the scattering of Goldstone bosons in the range of intermediate energies, and in particular focus our attention on the scattering of pions in the $\rho$-resonance region. The chiral perturbation series is obtained to order $E^4$ from a chiral $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ invariant effective Lagrangian. At order $E^4$, we isolate the low-energy manifestation of heavy particle exchange in the s-channel. We find that the contributions of this type to the I=1 and I=2 amplitudes have a one parameter dependence. This observation provides a symmetry rationale for Chanowitz's recent observation that in a chiral model with an explicitly coupled $\rho$, the I=1 and I=2 channels are strongly correlated. In order to realize, in a quantitative way, the fact that in the resonance region the direct-channel dominates, we make use of a simple and intuitive unitarization scheme. This allows us to derive a renormalization constant-independent relation for the I=1 and I=2 phase shifts. With the assumption of a $\rho$-resonance, this relation determines the position of a pole at euclidean momentum in the I=2 channel. Through an analysis based on the theory of redundant poles and the Adler sum rule we show that this ``tachyon'' pole actually represents a physical contribution to the unitary amplitude which accounts for $\rho$ and $\epsilon$ exchange in the u-channel. "
"We show that an 'ergodic' time scale can be extracted from the aging experiments on spin-glasses. This is the time for which a significant fraction of the metastable states have been visited. Experiments suggest that the number of metastable states per independent subsystem is $\simeq 10^{12}-10^{14}$. For our insulating spin-glass $({\rm CdCr}_{1.7} {\rm In}_{0.3} {\rm S}_4)$ this number doubles when the temperature is lowered by 1K, but is roughly constant for the metallic sample (Ag:Mn 2.6%). "
"We performed numerical simulations of 2D and 3D Edwards-Anderson spin glass models by using the recently developed multicanonical ensemble. Our ergodicity times increase with the lattice size approximately as $V^3$. The energy, entropy and other physical quantities are easily calculable at all temperatures from a single simulation. Their finite size scalings and the zero temperature limits are also explored. "
We consider the induced $2$d-gravity in the minisuperspace approach. The general solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is given in terms of different kind of Bessel functions of purely real or imaginary orders. We study the properties of the corresponding probability distribution finding a kind of phase transition at the critical point $\nu=0$. 
"We consider the evolution of the probability distribution $\pp (\chi ,\chib, \t)$, associated with an inhomogeneous light scalar field $\chi$ in the Robertson-Walker Universe, where the inhomogeneities are produced by quantum fluctuations during an earlier inflationary epoch. For a specific choice of scalar potential which occurs in models of so called late-time phase transitions in which domain walls are produced, $\pp$ is shown to evolve from a Gaussian to a non-Gaussian distribution. The structure of the latter justifies the recent use of 3-dimensional percolation theory to describe the initial distribution of domain walls in these models. "
"We present a large $q$ expansion of the 2d $q$-states Potts model free energies up to order 9 in $1/\sqrt{q}$. Its analysis leads us to an ansatz which, in the first-order region, incorporates properties inferred from the known critical regime at $q=4$, and predicts, for $q>4$, the $n^{\rm th}$ energy cumulant scales as the power $(3 n /2-2)$ of the correlation length. The parameter-free energy distributions reproduce accurately, without reference to any interface effect, the numerical data obtained in a simulation for $q=10$ with lattices of linear dimensions up to L=50. The pure phase specific heats are predicted to be much larger, at $q\leq10$, than the values extracted from current finite size scaling analysis of extrema. Implications for safe numerical determinations of interface tensions are discussed. "
"Testable conditional probabilities appear to be restricted to single hypersurfaces (marvelous moments) and depend only on stationary observables. Observable evolution, such as a change of entropy, should be expressed as a dependence upon clock time, not upon inaccessible coordinate time. "
"We study the loop representation of the quantum theory for 2+1 dimensional general relativity on a manifold, $M = {\cal T}^2 \times {\cal R}$, where ${\cal T}^2$ is the torus, and compare it with the connection representation for this system. In particular, we look at the loop transform in the part of the phase space where the holonomies are boosts and study its kernel. This kernel is dense in the connection representation and the transform is not continuous with respect to the natural topologies, even in its domain of definition. Nonetheless, loop representations isomorphic to the connection representation corresponding to this part of the phase space can still be constructed if due care is taken. We present this construction but note that certain ambiguities remain; in particular, functions of loops cannot be uniquely associated with functions of connections. "

"We present a detailed analysis of the phase transition in the standard model at finite temperature. Using an improved perturbation theory, where plasma masses are determined from a set of one-loop gap equations, we evaluate the effective potential $V_{eff}(\varphi,T)$ in next-to-leading order, i.e., including terms cubic in the gauge coupling $g$, the scalar self-coupling $\lambda^{1/2}$ and the top-quark Yukawa coupling $f_t$. The gap equations yield a non-vanishing magnetic plasma mass for the gauge bosons, originating from the non-abelian self-interactions. We discuss in detail size and origin of higher order effects and conclude that the phase transition is weakly first-order up to Higgs masses of about $70\ GeV$, above which our calculation is no longer self-consistent. For larger Higgs masses even an approximation containing all $g^4$ contributions to $V_{eff}$ is not sufficient, at least a full calculation to order $g^6$ is needed. These results turn out to be rather insensitive to the top-quark mass in the range $m_t=100\ -\ 180\ GeV$. Using Langer's theory of metastability we calculate the nucleation rate of critical droplets and discuss some aspects of the cosmological electroweak phase transition. "
"We examine the decays $t\rightarrow c\gamma$ and $c Z^0$ in the Standard Model with an extra scalar doublet and no discrete symmetry preventing tree-level flavour changing neutral currents. The Yukawa couplings of the new scalars are assumed to be proportional to fermion masses, evading bounds on FCNC's from the light quark sector. These rare top decays may be visible at the SSC. "
"We studied the performance of the multicanonical algorithm by simulating the van Hemmen spin glass model and reproduced the exact results for this mean field model. Physical quantities such as energy density, specific heat, susceptibility and order parameters are evaluated at all temperatures. "
"Using algorithms of Higuchi and of Grassberger and Procaccia, we study numerically how fractal dimensions cross over from finite-dimensional Brownian noise at short time scales to finite values of deterministic chaos at longer time scales for data generated from a Langevin equation that has a strange attractor in the limit of zero noise. Our results suggest that the crossover occurs at such short time scales that there is little chance of finite-dimensional Brownian noise being incorrectly identified as deterministic chaos. "
"A new 1-D discrete nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger (NLS) Hamiltonian is introduced which includes the integrable Ablowitz-Ladik system as a limit. The symmetry properties of the system are studied. The relationship between intrinsic localized states and the soliton of the Ablowitz-Ladik NLS is discussed. It is pointed out that a staggered localized state can be viewed as a particle of a {\em negative} effective mass. It is shown that staggered localized states can exist in the discrete dark NLS. The motion of localized states and Peierls-Nabarro pinning are studied. "
"We study the non-relativistic response of a 'diquark' bound by confining forces, for which perturbation theory in the interaction fails. As non-perturbative alternatives we consider the Gersch-Rodriguez-Smith theory and a summation method. We show that, contrary to the case of singular repulsive forces, the GRS theory can generally be applied to confined systems. When expressed in the GRS-West kinematic variable y, the response has a standard asymptotic limit and calculable dominant corrections of orders 1/q,1/q. That theory therefore clearly demonstrates how constituents, confined before and after the absorption of the transferred momentum and energy, behave as asymptotically free particles. We compare the GRS results with those for a summation method for harmonic and square well confinement and also discuss the convergence of the GRS series for the response in powers of 1/q. "
"We examine an approach to justifying the mean field approximation for the anyon gas, using the scattering of anyons. Parity violation permits a nonzero average scattering angle, from which one can extract a mean radius of curvature for anyons. If this is larger than the interparticle separation, one expects that the graininess of the statistical magnetic field is unimportant, and that the mean field approximation is good. We argue that a non-conventional interaction between anyons is crucial, in which case the criterion for validity of the approximation is identical to the one deduced using a self-consistency argument. "
"We prove to all orders of the loop expansion the low energy theorems of hidden local symmetries in four-dimensional nonlinear sigma models based on the coset space $G/H$, with $G$ and $H$ being arbitrary compact groups. Although the models are non-renormalizable, the proof is done in an analogous manner to the renormalization proof of gauge theories and two-dimensional nonlinear sigma models by restricting ourselves to the operators with two derivatives (counting a hidden gauge boson field as one derivative), i.e., with dimension 2, which are the only operators relevant to the low energy limit. Through loop-wise mathematical induction based on the Ward-Takahashi identity for the BRS symmetry, we solve renormalization equation for the effective action up to dimension-2 terms plus terms with the relevant BRS sources. We then show that all the quantum corrections to the dimension-2 operators, including the finite parts as well as the divergent ones, can be entirely absorbed into a re-definition (renormalization) of the parameters and the fields in the dimension-2 part of the tree-level Lagrangian. "
"This paper describes salient features of new sets of parton distributions obtained by the CTEQ Collaboration based on a comprehensive QCD global analysis of all available data. The accuracy of the new data on deep inelastic scattering structure functions obtained by the very high statistics NMC and CCFR experiments provides unprecedented sensitivity to the flavor dependence of the sea-quark distributions. In addition to much better determination of the small x dependence of all parton distributions, we found: (i) the strange quark distribution is much softer than the non-strange sea quarks and rises above the latter at small-x; and (ii) the difference $\bar d-\bar u$ changes sign as a function of x. A few alternative sets of viable distributions with conventional assumptions are also discussed. "
"We argue that massless (lambda Phi^4)_4 is ""trivial"" without being entirely trivial. It has a non-trivial effective potential which leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking, but the particle excitations above the broken vacuum are non-interacting. The key to this picture is the realization that the constant background field (the mode with zero 4-momentum) renormalizes differently from the fluctuation field (the finite-momentum modes). This picture reconciles rigorous results and lattice calculations with one-loop and Gaussian-approximation analyses. Because of ""triviality"", these latter two methods should be effectively exact. Indeed, they yield the same renormalized effective potential and the same relation m_h^2 = 8 pi^2 v^2 between the particle mass and the physical vacuum expectation value. This relation predicts a Higgs mass m_h about 2 TeV in the standard model. The non-interacting nature of the scalar sector implies, by the equivalence theorem, that Higgs and gauge bosons interact only weakly, through their gauge and Yukawa couplings. "
"The feeling that those two forcing notions-Cohen and Random-(equivalently the corresponding Boolean algebras Borel(R)/(meager sets), Borel(R)/(null sets)) are special, was probably old and widespread. A reasonable interpretation is to show them unique, or ``minimal'' or at least characteristic in a family of ``nice forcing'' like Borel. We shall interpret ``nice'' as Souslin as suggested by Judah Shelah [JdSh 292]. We divide the family of Souslin forcing to two, and expect that: among the first part, i.e. those adding some non-dominated real, Cohen is minimal (=is below every one), while among the rest random is quite characteristic even unique. Concerning the second class we have weak results, concerning the first class, our results look satisfactory. We have two main results: one (1.14) says that Cohen forcing is ``minimal'' in the first class, the other (1.10) says that all c.c.c. Souslin forcing have a property shared by Cohen forcing and Random real forcing, so it gives a weak answer to the problem on how special is random forcing, but says much on all c.c.c. Souslin forcing. "
It is proved that -- consistently -- there can be no ccc closed P-sets in the remainder space omega^* . 
"Based on the Ward-Takahashi identity for the BRS symmetry, we prove to all orders of the loop expansion the low energy theorem of hidden local symmetry for the vector mesons (KSRF (I) relation) in the $U(N)_{\rm L}$ $\times$ $U(N)_{\rm R}$ / $U(N)_{\rm V}$ nonlinear chiral Lagrangian. "
"I review recent works on the problem of inducing large-N QCD by matrix fields. In the first part of the talk I describe the matrix models which induce large-N QCD and present the results of studies of their phase structure by the standard lattice technology (in particular, by the mean field method). The second part is devoted to the exact solution of these models in the strong coupling region by means of the loop equations. "
The solution of the plasmon problem and the subsequent development of an effective field theory approach to ultrarelativistic plasmas are reviewed. The effective lagrangians that summarize collective effects in ultrarelativistic quark-gluon and electron-photon plasmas are presented. A generalization that describes an electromagnetic plasma at all temperatures and densities is proposed. 
"We propose a classical model for the non-Abelian Chern-Simons theory coupled to $N$ point-like sources and quantize the system using the BRST technique. The resulting quantum mechanics provides a unified framework for fractional spin, braid statistics and Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. "
"We use a Boltzmann equation to determine the magnetoconductivity of quantum wires. The presence of a confining potential in addition to the magnetic field removes the degeneracy of the Landau levels and allows one to associate a group velocity with each single-particle state. The distribution function describing the occupation of these single-particle states satisfies a Boltzmann equation, which may be solved exactly in the case of impurity scattering. In the case where the electrons scatter against both phonons and impurities we solve numerically - and in certain limits analytically - the integral equation for the distribution function, and determine the conductivity as a function of temperature and magnetic field. The magnetoconductivity exhibits a maximum at a temperature, which depends on the relative strength of the impurity and electron-phonon scattering, and shows oscillations when the Fermi energy or the magnetic field is varied. "
"Using a variety of parameters of local galaxy density, we have examined the effects of the environmental density on the presence of bar structures in spiral galaxies of various morphological types. For an extensive sample of nearby galaxies, listed in the ``Nearby Galaxies Catalogue'' (Tully, 1988a), we have found that the spirals characterized by a high local density tend to be barred if they are early-type and early-type if they are barred (at the significance level of $\sim$3 sigma), confirming some earlier suggestion of low statistical significance. This fact, which is observed substantially in low-luminosity spirals, indicates that galaxy interactions can stimulate the formation of bars, primarily in early-type, low-luminosity spirals. This is in partial, qualitative agreement with the most recent relevant N-body simulations. On the other hand, no significant density segregation is observed between pure S-shaped (S(s)) spirals and spirals with inner rings (S(r)), which are often associated with bars. {\it Subject headings:} galaxies: general --- galaxies: structure --- galaxies: interactions --- galaxies: clustering "
"Vertex corrections are taken into account in the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the nucleon propagator in a relativistic field theory of fermions and mesons. The usual Hartree-Fock approximation for the nucleon propagator is known to produce the appearance of complex (ghost) poles which violate basic theorems of quantum field theory. In a theory with vector mesons there are vertex corrections that produce a strongly damped vertex function in the ultraviolet. One set of such corrections is known as the Sudakov form factor in quantum electrodynamics. When the Sudakov form factor generated by massive neutral vector mesons is included in the Hartree-Fock approximation to the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the nucleon propagator, the ghost poles disappear and consistency with basic requirements of quantum field theory is recovered. "
"We introduce a data analysis procedure for color transparency experiments which is considerably less model dependent than the transparency ratio method. The new method is based on fitting the shape of the A dependence of the nuclear cross section at fixed momentum transfer to determine the effective attenuation cross section for hadrons propagating through the nucleus. The procedure does not require assumptions about the hard scattering rate inside the nuclear medium. Instead, the hard scattering rate is deduced directly from the data. The only theoretical input necessary is in modelling the attenuation due to the nuclear medium, for which we use a simple exponential law. We apply this procedure to the Brookhaven experiment of Carroll et al and find that it clearly shows color transparency: the effective attenuation cross section in events with momentum transfer $Q^2$ is approximately $40\ mb\ (2.2\ GeV^2/Q^2)$. The fit to the data also supports the idea that the hard scattering inside the nuclear medium is closer to perturbative QCD predictions than is the scattering of isolated protons in free space. We also discuss the application of our approach to electroproduction experiments. "
"We consider a one-dimensional Osp($N|2M$) pseudoparticle mechanical model which may be written as a phase space gauge theory. We show how the pseudoparticle model naturally encodes and explains the two-dimensional zero curvature approach to finding extended conformal symmetries. We describe a procedure of partial gauge fixing of these theories which leads generally to theories with superconformally extended ${\cal W}$-algebras. The pseudoparticle model allows one to derive the finite transformations of the gauge and matter fields occurring in these theories with extended conformal symmetries. In particular, the partial gauge fixing of the Osp($N|2$) pseudoparticle mechanical models results in theories with the SO($N$) invariant $N$-extended superconformal symmetry algebra of Bershadsky and Knizhnik. These algebras are nonlinear for $N \geq 3.$ We discuss in detail the cases of $N=1$ and $N=2,$ giving two new derivations of the superschwarzian derivatives. Some comments are made in the $N=2$ case on how twisted and topological theories represent a significant deformation of the original particle model. The particle model also allows one to interpret superconformal transformations as deformations of flags in super jet bundles over the associated super Riemann surface. "
"A brief review of the role of the Higgs mechanism and the ensuing Higgs particle in the Minimal Standard Model is given. Then the property of triviality of the scalar sector in the Minimal Standard Model and the upper bound on the Higgs mass that follows is discussed. It is emphasized that the bound is obtained by limiting cutoff effects on physical processes. Actions that allow a parameterization and tuning of the leading cutoff effects are studied both analytically, in the large $N$ limit of the generalization of the $O(4)$ symmetry of the scalar sector to $O(N)$, and numerically for the physical case $N = 4$. Combining those results we show that the Minimal Standard Model will describe physics to an accuracy of a few percent up to energies of the order 2 to 4 times the Higgs mass, $M_H$, only if $M_H \le 710 \pm 60 ~ GeV$. This bound is the result of a systematic search in the space of dimension six operators and is expected to hold in the {\it continuum}.

"We discuss the Dirac quantization of two dimensional gravity with bosonic matter fields. After defining the extended Hamiltonian it is possible to fix the gauge completely. The commutators can all be obtained in closed form; nevertheless, the results are not particularly simple. "
"The set of degenerate ground states of an arbitrary nonabelian topologically massive gauge theory is shown to be in one-to-one correspondence with the Hilbert space of the associated pure Chern-Simons theory. (Paper is being withdrawn: original conclusion is incorrect for the nonabelian case. For a correct treatment, see M. Asorey, S. Carlip, and F. Falceto, hep-th/9304081.) "
"The phase variation of the superconducting gap over the (normal) Fermi surface of the high-temperature superconductors remains a significant unresolved question. Is the phase of the gap constant, does it change sign, or is it perhaps complex? A detailed answer to this question would provide important constraints on various pairing mechanisms. Here we propose a new method for measuring the relative gap PHASE on the Fermi surface which is direct, is angle-resolved, and probes the bulk. The required experiments involve measuring phonon linewidths in the normal and superconducting state, with resolution available in current facilities. We primarily address the La_1.85Sr_.15CuO_4 material, but also propose a more detailed study of a specific phonon in Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8. "
"We modify the $SL(2,{\bf R})/U(1)$ WZW theory, which was shown to describe strings in a 2D black hole, to be invariant under chiral $U(1)$ gauge symmetry by introducing a Steukelberg field. We impose several interesting gauge conditions for the chiral $U(1)$ symmetry. In a paticular gauge the theory is found to be reduced to the Liouville theory coupled to the $c=1$ matter perturbed by the so-called black hole mass operator. Also we discuss the physical states in the models briefly. "
"Using operator sewing techniques we construct the Reggeon vertex involving four external ${\bf Z}_3$-twisted complex fermionic fields. Generalizing a procedure recently applied to the ordinary Ramond four-vertex, we deduce the closed form of the ${\bf Z}_3$ vertex by demanding it to reproduce the results obtained by sewing. "
"The present paper is revised copy of hep-th/9303087 in which higher spin extensions of the nonabelian gauge symmetries for the classical WZNW model are considered. Both linear and nonlinear realizations of the extended affine Kac-Moody algebra are obtained. A characteristic property of the WZNW model is that it admits a higher spin linear realization of the extended affine Kac-Moody algebra which is equivalent to the corresponding higher spin nonlinear realization of the same algebra. However, in both cases the higher spin currents do not form an invariant space with respect to their generating transformations. This makes it imposible for this symmetry to be gauged. "
A relation between an $Sp(2M)$ gauge particle model and the zero-curvature condition in a two-dimensional gauge theory is presented. For the $Sp(4)$ case we construct finite \W-transformations. 
"The values of the Witten invariants, $I_W$, of the lens space $L(p, 1)$ for SU(2) at level $k$ are obtained for arbitrary $p$. A duality relation for $I_W$ when $p$ and $k$ are interchanged, valid for asymptotic $k$, is observed. A method for calculating $I_W$ for any group $G$ is described. It is found that $I_W$ for $Z_m$, even for $m = 2$, distinguishes 3-manifolds quite effectively. "
"We show that $~N=1$~ {\it supersymmetric} Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (SKP) equations can be embedded into recently formulated $~N=1$~ self-dual {\it supersymmetric} Yang-Mills theories after appropriate dimensional reduction and truncation, which yield three-dimensional supersymmetric Chern-Simons theories. Based on this result, we also give conjectural \hbox{$N=2~$} SKP equations. Subsequently some exact solutions of these systems including fermionic fields are given. "
"We study a deformed $su(m|n)$ algebra on a quantum superspace. Some interesting aspects of the deformed algebra are shown. As an application of the deformed algebra we construct a deformed superconformal algebra. {}From the deformed $su(1|4)$ algebra, we derive deformed Lorentz, translation of Minkowski space, $iso(2,2)$ and its supersymmetric algebras as closed subalgebras with consistent automorphisms. "
"\noindent The well-known exact solution of the massless Schwinger model can be simply obtained by perturbing around a vacuum without the Dirac sea of filled negative energy states. The unusual vacuum structure changes the sign of the $i\epsilon$ prescription at the negative energy pole of the free fermion propagator. Consequently, all convergent fermion loop integrals vanish. The logarithmically divergent two-point loop gives a mass $e/\sqrt\pi$ to the photon, which turns into the free pointlike boson of the Schwinger model. We discuss the possiblity of using corresponding expansions to describe charge screening effects in the massive Schwinger model and the confinement phenomenon of QCD. "
"We generalize the Lax pair and B\""acklund transformations for Liouville and Toda field theories as well as their supersymmetric generalizations, to the case of arbitrary Riemann surfaces. We make use of the fact that Toda field theory arises naturally and geometrically in a restriction of so called $W$--geometry to ordinary Riemannian geometry. This derivation sheds light on the geometrical structure underlying complete integrability of these systems. (Invited talk presented at the 877th meeting of the American Mathematical Society, USC, November 1992 and at the YITP workshop ``Directions on Quantum Gravity"", Kyoto, November 1992.) "
"We examine the scattering of longitudinal $W$, $Z$ and Higgs bosons in the Standard Model using the equivalent Goldstone-boson Lagrangian. Our calculations include the full one-loop scattering matrix between the states $W^+_LW^-_L$, $Z_LZ_L$ and $HH$ with no restrictions on the relative sizes of $M_H$ and $\sqrt{s}$. In addition to deriving the perturbative eigen-amplitudes, we also obtain quite striking results by unitarizing the amplitudes with the use of the K-matrix and Pad\'e techniques. (Complete postscript file can be obtained by anonymous ftp from hal.physics.wayne.edu as dpf92g.ps in directory pub/physics ) "
"Upper bounds for neutral as well as charged Higgs boson masses in a two-doublet model are obtained on the basis of tree unitarity conditions \`a la Lee, Quigg and Thacker. A wide variety of scattering processes are considered so extensively that our bounds are more restrictive than those obtained previously for neutral Higgs bosons and are also of a new kind for charged Higgs boson. It is argued that at least one of the Higgs bosons should be lighter than 580 ${\rm GeV}/c^{2}$. "
The validity of the renormalization group approach for large $N$ is clarified by using the vector model as an example. An exact difference equation is obtained which relates free energies for neighboring values of $N$. The reparametrization freedom in field space provides infinitely many identities which reduce the infinite dimensional coupling constant space to that of finite dimensions. The effective beta functions give exact values for the fixed points and the susceptibility exponents. 
"The effective action is computed for the \lphi--theory at finite temperature for small perturbations about a constant background field, using a generalized tadpole method. We find the complete effective action, including the real and imaginary parts, to all orders in derivatives and to order ${\cal O}(\lambda^2)$. We demonstrate that the high $T$ approximation, where only the zero Matsubara frequency is included, is incorrect for the imaginary part even though it is UV-finite. The solutions of the dispersion relations show that initial perturbations do not necessarily thermalize fast enough to be absent at the onset of phase transition. "
"The correspondence claimed by M. Douglas, between the multicritical regimes of the two-matrix model and 2D gravity coupled to (p,q) rational matter field, is worked out explicitly. We found the minimal (p,q) multicritical potentials U(X) and V(Y) which are polynomials of degree p and q, correspondingly. The loop averages W(X) and \tilde W(Y) are shown to satisfy the Heisenberg relations {W,X} =1 and {\tilde W,Y}=1 and essentially coincide with the canonical momenta P and Q. The operators X and Y create the two kinds of boundaries in the (p,q) model related by the duality (p,q) - (q,p). Finally, we present a closed expression for the two two-loop correlators and interpret its scaling limit. "
"We show that the transverse polarization asymmetry of the $\tau$-lepton in the decay $t\rightarrow b \tau \nu$ is extremely sensitive to CP violating phases arising from the charged Higgs exchange in the Weinberg model of CP non-conservation. Qualitatively, the polarization asymmetries are enhanced over rate or energy asymmetries by a factor of $\approx {m_t\over m_\tau}\approx O(100)$. Thus for optimal values of the parameters the method requires $\approx 10^4$ top pairs to be observable rather than $10^7$ needed for rate or energy asymmetries. We also examine $\tau$ polarization in b decays via $b \rightarrow c \nu \tau$ and find that it can also be very effective in constraining the CP violation parameters of the extended Higgs sector. "
"Light-front current matrix elements for elastic scattering from hadrons with spin~1 or greater must satisfy a nontrivial constraint associated with the requirement of rotational covariance for the current operator. Using a model $\rho$ meson as a prototype for hadronic quark models, this constraint and its implications are studied at both low and high momentum transfers. In the kinematic region appropriate for asymptotic QCD, helicity rules, together with the rotational covariance condition, yield an additional relation between the light-front current matrix elements. "
"Within the unified model of Bohr and Mottelson we derive the following linear energy weighted sum rule for low energy orbital 1$^+$ excitations in even-even deformed nuclei $$S_{\rm LE}^{\rm lew} (M_1^{\rm orb}) \cong (6/5) \epsilon (B(E2; 0^+_1 \rightarrow 2_1^+ K=0)/Z e^2<r^2>^2) \mu^2_N$$ with B(E2) the E2 strength for the transition from the ground state to the first excited state in the ground state rotational band, $<r^2>$ the charge r.m.s. radius squared and $\epsilon$ the binding energy per nucleon in the nuclear ground state. It is shown that this energy weighted sum rule is in good agreement with available experimental data. The sum rule is derived using a simple ansatz for the intrinsic ground state wave function that predicts also high energy 1$^+$ strength at 2$\hbar \omega$ carrying 50\% of the total $m_1$ moment of the orbital M1 operator. "
"The trace anomaly term in the low energy chiral Lagrangian is established by deriving a low energy theorem for $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \pi^0\pi^0$ scattering. It contributes to $\sigma(\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \pi^0\pi^0)$ in the same order as the previously computed pion loop contribution. The coherent sum of the two contributions explains the shape of the measured cross section, while the magnitude is determined by the anomalous dimension of the quark mass operator. "
"Results for d$\sigma$/d$\Omega$ and $A_N$ in the reaction $\bar{p}p \rightarrow \pi^- \pi^+$ are predicted by a simple quark model. They are compared to recent experimental data from LEAR, as well as to previous predictions from nucleon-exchange models. At low energy the quark model does better than the nucleon-exchange models, but the overall comparison to experiment remains poor. In particular, the double-dip structure of the experimental $A_N$ data is only partly represented. This shortcoming of the simple quark model is traced back to a too small J=2 amplitude. This has interesting implications for the range of this specific annihilation process. "
"We study the possible flavour asymmetry, $\bar{u} \neq \bar{d}$, of the light quark sea distributions of the proton. We discuss the information that is at present available from data on deep-inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering and from Drell-Yan production on various nuclear targets. We show that the ratio of dilepton yields on hydrogen and deuterium targets is very sensitive to $\bar{u}-\bar{d}$. "
"Remarkable parallelism between the theory of integrable systems of first-order quasilinear PDE and some old results in projective and affine differential geometry of conjugate nets, Laplace equations, their Bianchi-Baecklund transformations is exposed. These results were recently applied by I.M.Krichever and B.A.Dubrovin to prove integrability of some models in topological field theories. Within the geometric framework we derive some new integrable (in a sense to be discussed) generalizations describing N-wave resonant interactions. "
"We present images of the peculiar galaxy Arp~10 which reveal two rings of concurrent star formation. Apart from a bright ring visible on early photographs of the system, an even brighter inner ring of \ion{H}{2} regions is found within the nuclear bulge of the galaxy. A very faint ring-arc of \ion{H}{2} regions is also seen associated with a third outer ring or shell. An investigation of the H$\alpha$ fluxes in the rings reveals an increase in the emission where the ring surface density in the R-band light exceeds 21.3$\pm$0.2 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. If the R-band light is dominated by old stars in the underlying density wave, then the results suggest evidence for a Star Formation law which exhibits a threshold dependence on the strength of the density wave in the rings. Even if the R-band continuum in the ring is heavily contaminated with red light from the underlying young stars then a smaller, but still significant non-linear enhancement in the star formation rates (SFR) in one segment of the second ring is required to explain the results. In either case, strong trends in the SFR with azimuth around Ring~2 are in good agreement with off-center collisional ring galaxy models. "
"It was recently shown by the authors that the Fritzsch ansatz for the quark mass matrices prescribed at the supersymmetric grand unified scale is compatible with a moderately heavy top quark ($m_t \simeq 120-150~GeV$). Here we extend the ansatz to incorporate the charged leptons and the neutrinos. It is found that the $\nu_e-\nu_\mu$ mixing angle is small and consistent with the MSW solution of the solar neutrino puzzle. Furthermore, the model predicts observable $\nu_\mu-\nu_\tau$ oscillations with sin$^22\theta_{\mu \tau} \simeq 0.1$ and $\nu_\tau$ mass in the $(1-3)~eV$ range. "
"We discuss systematically the consistency of light gluinos with data on perturbative QCD from deep inelastic scattering, quarkonia, jets at LEP, and the total hadronic cross-section in ${e^+ e^-}$ annihilation on the $Z$ peak and elsewhere. We demonstrate that, in addition to the well-known increase in the value of $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ inferred from lower-energy data due to the slower running of $\alpha_s$ in the presence of light gluinos, the value of $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ extracted from the LEP data must also be $increased$, as a result of including the effects of virtual light gluinos. The effect of these increases in other estimates of $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ is to make them more consistent with the value extracted from the total $e^+ e^-$ cross-section, which would otherwise appear distinctly higher. We discuss the possibility of looking for light gluinos in four-jet events at LEP, and their possible implications for scaling violations at HERA. "
We calculate a large $k$ asymptotic expansion of the exact surgery formula for Witten's $SU(2)$ invariant of Seifert manifolds. The contributions of all flat connections are identified. An agreement with the 1-loop formula is checked. A contribution of the irreducible connections appears to contain only a finite number of terms in the asymptotic series. A 2-loop correction to the contribution of the trivial connection is found to be proportional to Casson's invariant. 
"In the quenched approximation, the gauge covariance properties of three vertex Ans\""{a}tze in the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion self energy are analysed in three- and four- dimensional quantum electrodynamics. Based on the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action, it is inferred that the spectral representation used for the vertex in the gauge technique cannot support dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. A criterion for establishing whether a given Ansatz can confer gauge covariance upon the Schwinger-Dyson equation is presented and the Curtis and Pennington Ansatz is shown to satisfy this constraint. We obtain an analytic solution of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for quenched, massless three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics for arbitrary values of the gauge parameter in the absence of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. "
"Explicit formulas of the universal $R$-matrix are given for all quantized nontwisted rank 3 affine Lie algebras $U_q(A_2^{(1)})\,,~U_q(C_2^{(1)})$ and $U_q(G_2^{(1)})$. "
We compute the branching ratio for $\Delta\rightarrow Ne^+e^-$ and $\Delta\rightarrow N\mu^+\mu^-$ in chiral perturbation theory and find that both decays should be observable at CEBAF. With sufficiently low thresholds on the $e^+e^-$ invariant mass a branching ratio of $\sim 10^{-5}$ may be observed for $\Delta\rightarrow Ne^+e^-$. For the $\Delta\rightarrow N\mu^+\mu^-$ decay mode we predict a branching ratio of $3\times 10^{-7}$. The dependence of the M1 and E2 amplitudes on the momentum transfer will provide a useful test of chiral perturbation theory which predicts $\sim 20\%$ variation over the allowed kinematic range. 
"Magnetic moment measurements in odd nuclei directly probe the distribution of fermion states and hence provide one of the most critical tests for multi-$j$ supersymmetries in collective nuclei. Due to complexity of calculations and lack of data, such tests have not been performed in the past. Using the Mathematica software, we derive analytic expressions for magnetic moments in the $SO^{(BF)}(6) \times SU^{(F)}(2)$ limit of the $U(6/12)$ supersymmetry and compare the results with recent measurements in $^{195}$Pt. "
"A review of the appearence of integrable structures in the matrix model description of $2d$-gravity is presented. Most of ideas are demonstrated at the technically simple but ideologically important examples. Matrix models are considered as a sort of ""effective"" description of continuum $2d$ field theory formulation. The main physical role in such description is played by the Virasoro-$W$ constraints which can be interpreted as a certain unitarity or factorization constraints. Bith discrete and continuum (Generalized Kontsevich) models are formulated as the solutions to those discrete (continuous) Virasoro-$W$ constraints. Their integrability properties are proven using mostly the determinant technique highly related to the representation in terms of free fields. The paper also contains some new observations connected to formulation of more general than GKM solutions and deeper understanding of their relation to $2d$ gravity. "
"We have evaluated the angular-momentum distribution functions for finite numbers of electrons in Laughlin states. For very small numbers of electrons the angular-momentum state occupation numbers have been evaluated exactly while for larger numbers of electrons they have been obtained from Monte-Carlo estimates of the one-particle density matrix. An exact relationship, valid for any number of electrons, has been derived for the ratio of the occupation numbers of the two outermost orbitals of the Laughlin droplet and is used to test the accuracy of the MC calculations. We compare the occupation numbers near the outer edges of the droplets with predictions based on the chiral Luttinger liquid picture of Laughlin state edges and discuss the surprisingly large oscillations in occupation numbers which occur for angular momenta far from the edge. "
"A new approach is proposed to phenomenological study of a generic unified supergravity model, which reduces to the minimal supersymmetric standard model. The model is effectively parametrized in terms of five low energy observables. In consequence, it is easy to investigate systematically the parameter space of the model, allowed by the requirement of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking and by the present experimental limits. Radiative corrections due to large Yukawa couplings and particle--sparticle mass splitting are included into the analysis and found to have important effects, in particular on the degree of fine tuning in the model. In this framework there are presented the predictions of the model for various low energy physical observables and their dependence on the values of the top quark mass and $\tan\beta$ is discussed. Results are also given for the large $\tan\beta$ scenario, $\tan\beta\approx m_t/m_b$. Our approach can be easily extended to non--minimal supergravity models, which do not assume the universality of the soft breaking parameters at the unification scale $M_X$. Such an extension will be particularly useful once the masses of some sparticles are known, allowing for a model independent study of the parameter space at $M_X$. "
"We study the integral representation for the exact solution to nonperturbative $c le 1$ string theory. A generic solution is determined by two functions $W(x)$ and $Q(x)$ which behaive at infinity like $x^p$ and $x^q$ respectively. The integral model for arbitrary $(p,q)$ models is derived which explicitely demonstrates $p-q$ duality of minimal models coupled to gravity. We discuss also the exact solutions to string equation and reduction condition and present several explicit examples. "
"Flux-tubes in different representations of SU(2) and U(1) lattice gauge theories in three dimensions are measured. Wilson loops generate heavy ``quark-antiquark'' pairs in fundamental ($j=1/2$), adjoint ($j=1$), and quartet ($j=3/2$) representations of SU(2). The first direct lattice measurements of the flux-tube cross-section ${\cal A}_j$ as a function of representation are made. It is found that ${\cal A}_j \approx {\rm constant}$, to about 10\%. Results are consistent with a connection between the string tension $\sigma_j$ and ${\cal A}_j$ suggested by a simplified flux-tube model, $\sigma_j = g^2 j(j+1) / (2 {\cal A}_j)$ [$g$ is the gauge coupling], given that $\sigma_j$ scales like the Casimir $j(j+1)$, as observed in previous lattice studies in both three and four dimensions. The results can discriminate among phenomenological models of the physics underlying confinement. Flux-tubes for singly- and doubly-charged Wilson loops in compact QED$_3$ are also measured. It is found that the string tension scales as the squared-charge and the flux-tube cross-section is independent of charge to good approximation. These SU(2) and U(1) simulations lend some support, albeit indirectly, to a conjecture that the dual superconductor mechanism underlies confinement in compact gauge theories in both three and four dimensions. "
We define a block observable for the $q$-state Potts model which exhibits an intermittent behaviour at the critical point. We express the intermittency indices of the normalised moments in terms of the magnetic critical exponent $\beta /\nu$ of the model. We confirm this relation by a numerical similation of the $q=2$ (Ising) and $q=3$ two-dimensional Potts model. 
Let $U_q(\hat{\cal G})$ denote the quantized affine Lie algebra and $U_q({\cal G}^{(1)})$ the quantized {\em nontwisted} affine Lie algebra. Let ${\cal O}_{\rm fin}$ be the category defined in section 3. We show that when the deformation parameter $q$ is not a root of unit all integrable representations of $U_q(\hat{\cal G})$ in the category ${\cal O}_{\rm fin}$ are completely reducible and that every integrable irreducible highest weight module over $U_q({\cal G}^{(1)})$ corresponding to $q>0$ is equivalent to a unitary module. 
Clusters of the two-dimensionnal t--J model with 2 holes and up to 26 sites are diagonalized using a Lanczos algorithm. The behaviour of the binding energy with system size suggests the existence of a finite critical value of J above which binding occurs in the bulk. Only the d-wave pair field operator acting on the Heisenberg GS has a finite overlap with the 2 hole ground state for all the clusters considered. The related spectral function associated with the propagation of a d-wave (spin singlet) pair of holes in the antiferromagnetic background is calculated. The quasiparticle peak at the bottom of the spectrum as well as some structure appearing above the peak survive with increasing cluster size. Although no simple scaling law was found for the quasiparticle weight the data strongly suggest that this weight is finite in the bulk limit and is roughly proportional to the antiferromagnetic coupling J (for J<1). 
The angular momentum (partial wave) reduction of the Lippmann--Schwinger equation describing the interaction of two spin 1/2 particles is extended to the case in which the spin singlet and triplet states are coupled. A straight forward method for obtaining the angular momentum decomposition of the general potential is indicated. The derived formalism is needed to describe the interaction between two nonidentical spin--1/2 particles or between two nucleons when isospin symmetry is violated. The resulting modification of the Stapp phase--shift analysis is given. 
"A program is outlined concerning the set of all solutions of the hyperbolic Ernst equation on a two-dimensional manifold whose underlying topological space is the same as the domain of all Ernst potentials for colliding plane gravitational wave pairs. The aim of the program is to construct and apply a non-trivial extension of the group of Kinnersley-Chitre transformations. This is to be done by employing the formalism of a homogeneous Hilbert problem. In this first paper of a series, the aforementioned program is completely carried out for the collinear polarization case. "
We analyse the recent precision measurements of the lepton-hadron deep inelastic scattering at CERN and SLAC to extract model independent constraints among the nucleon matrix elements of the twist-4 operators. We also study a parameterization of these matrix elements and point out the possibility that the matrix elements of the quark-gluon mixed operator has a negative value of the order of $- (400 \pm 100\ {\rm MeV})^2$ at 5 GeV$^2$ renormalization scale. 
"The self-consistent chiral soliton of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model including the $\omega,\rho$ and $a_1$ (axial-) vector meson fields besides the chiral angle is investigated. The resulting energy spectrum of the one particle Dirac Hamiltonian is strongly distorted leading to a polarized Dirac sea which carries the complete baryon number. This supports Witten's conjecture that baryons can be described as topological solitons. The exploration of the isoscalar mean squared radius of the nucleon exhibits that the repulsive character of the isoscalar vector field $\omega$ as well as the attractive features of the (axial-) vector mesons $\rho$ and $a_1$ are reproduced in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. The axial charge of the nucleon $g_A$ comes out far too small. This can be understood as an artifact of the proper time regularization prescription. "
"The inclusive radiative $B$-decay is a sensitive probe of new physics, especially if related to the virtual exchange of a charged Higgs boson. Supersymmetric models provide a particularly interesting example. In the limit of exact supersymmetry, BR($b \to s\gamma$)~=~0, due to the vanishing of any magnetic-moment transition operator. We illustrate the impact of this constraint for realistic values of the supersymmetry-breaking parameters. "
"n-Ising spins on a random surface represented by a matrix model is studied as a model of the 2D gravity coupled to matter field with the central charge c > 1. The magnetic field is introduced to discuss the scaling exponent $\Delta$, and the value of this magnetic field exponent is estimated by the series expansion. "
"A derivation of the Hawking effect is given which avoids reference to field modes above some cutoff frequency $\omega_c\gg M^{-1}$ in the free-fall frame of the black hole. To avoid reference to arbitrarily high frequencies, it is necessary to impose a boundary condition on the quantum field in a timelike region near the horizon, rather than on a (spacelike) Cauchy surface either outside the horizon or at early times before the horizon forms. Due to the nature of the horizon as an infinite redshift surface, the correct boundary condition at late times outside the horizon cannot be deduced, within the confines of a theory that applies only below the cutoff, from initial conditions prior to the formation of the hole. A boundary condition is formulated which leads to the Hawking effect in a cutoff theory. It is argued that it is possible the boundary condition is {\it not} satisfied, so that the spectrum of black hole radiation may be significantly different from that predicted by Hawking, even without the back-reaction near the horizon becoming of order unity relative to the curvature. "
The spherical symmetric dyonic black hole solutions of the effective action of heterotic string are studied perturbatively up to second order in the inverse string tension. An expression for the temperature in term of the mass and the electric and magnetic charge of the black hole is derived and it is shown that its behaviour is qualitatively different in the two special cases where either the electric or the magnetic charge vanishes 
"To model the dynamics of the chiral order parameter in a far from equilibrium phase transition, we consider quenching in the O(4) linear sigma model. We argue, and present numerical evidence, that in the period immediately following the quench long wavelength modes of the pion field are amplified. This results in large regions of coherent pion oscillations, and could lead to dramatic phenomenological consequences in heavy ion collisions. "
"We study the 3d effective field theory of a weakly coupled two Higgs-doublet scalar model at high temperature. Our model has three scalar quartic couplings and an $O(4)$ symmetry which is spontaneously broken by a nonzero scalar field $vev$ at zero temperature. Using high temperature perturbation theory, renormalization group arguments in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions, as well as $1/N$ expansion techniques in 3 dimensions, we argue that the transition from the high temperature symmetry restoring phase to the low temperature phase is first order for a range of scalar couplings. This result is not due to gauge couplings. We discuss the implications of our results for baryogenesis in the two Higgs-doublet electroweak model, especially when the lightest neutral Higgs is heavier than the W--bosons. "
"We present an investigation of gauge-invariant smearing for Wilson fermions in quenched lattice QCD on a $24^3 \times 48$ lattice at $\beta = 6.2$. We demonstrate a smearing algorithm that allows a substantial improvement in the determination of the baryon spectrum obtained using propagators smeared at both source and sink, at only a small computational cost. We investigate the matrix of correlators constructed from local and smeared operators, and are able to expose excited states of both the mesons and baryons. "
"One-loop radiative corrections to the charged Higgs coupling to two fermions and to the charged Higgs fermionic decay are studied. A renormalization scheme is proposed including the definition of the parameter $\tan\beta$ through the coupling of the CP-odd Higgs boson to a charged lepton pair. Loops including top and bottom quarks and squarks are considered using the unitary gauge. Large corrections to the coupling are found when there is a substantial mixing in the squark mass matrix, but these corrections are suprress in the decay rate. Interesting applications to rare processes are discussed. "
"In this talk some essential features of stringy black holes are described. We consider charged four-dimensional axion-dilaton black holes. The Hawking temperature and the entropy of all solutions are shown to be simple functions of the squares of supercharges, defining the positivity bounds. Spherically symmetric and multi black hole solutions are presented. The extreme solutions have some unbroken supersymmetries. Axion-dilaton black holes with zero entropy and zero area of the horizon form a family of stable particle-like objects, which we call holons. We discuss the possibility of splitting of nearly extreme black holes into holons. "
We discuss the derivation of $SO(10)$ G.U.T. models from higher dimensional theories with intermediate breaking scales. We then present models based on the Coset Space Dimensional Reduction Scheme with intermediate symmetry breaking induced by four fermion condensates. 
"It is observed that a large class of $(2,2)$ string vacua with $n>5$ superfields can be rewritten as Landau_Ginzburg orbifolds with discrete torsion and $n=5$. The naive geometric interpretation (if one exists) would be that of a complex 3-fold, not necessarily K\""ahler but still with vanishing first Chern class. "
"We prove that the initial-value problem for the motion of a certain type of elastic body has a solution for all time if the initial data are sufficiently small. The body must fill all of three space, obey a ``neo-Hookean'' stress-strain law, and be incompressible. The proof takes advantage of the delayed singularity formation which occurs for solutions of quasi-linear hyperbolic equations in more than one space dimension. It turns out that the curl of the displacement of the body obeys such an equation. Thus using Klainerman's inequality, one derives the necessary estimates to gaurantee that solutions persist for all time. "
"It is shown that site disorder induces noncoplanar states, competing with the thermal selection of coplanar states, in the nearest neighbor, classical kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet (AFM). For weak disorder, it is found that the ground state energy is the sum of energies of separately satisfied triangles of spins. This implies that disorder does not induce conventional spin glass behavior. A transformation is presented, mapping ground state spin configurations onto a folded triangular sheet (a new kind of ``spin origami'') which has conformations similar to those of tethered membranes. "
"In the usual real-time finite-temperature gauge theory both the physical and the unphysical degrees of freedom are thermalised. We discuss the alternative approach where only the physical transverse components of the gauge field have bare thermal propagators, whereas the unphysical degrees of freedom are not heated. We show how pinch singularities are avoided: sometimes this requires resummation. If only the hard thermal loop is included in the resummation, the spatially-longitudinal component of the gauge field, which contains an extra collective plasmon mode, becomes fully thermalised, though the Faddeev-Popov ghost and the remaining unphysical component of the gauge field remain frozen. "
"A representative but not exhaustive review of the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) approach to the nonperturbative study of QCD is presented. The main focus is the SDE for the quark self energy but studies of the gluon propagator and quark-gluon vertex are also discussed insofar as they are important to the quark SDE. The scope of this article is the application of these equations to the study of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, quark confinement and the phenomenology of the spectrum and dynamics of QCD. "
"The rare decay modes Higgs $\rightarrow$ four light fermions, and Higgs $\rightarrow$ single top-quark + three light fermions for $m_t<M_H<2m_t$, are presented, and phenomenologically interpreted. The angular correlation between fermion planes is presented as a test of the spin and intrinsic parity of the Higgs particle. In Higgs decay to single top, two tree-level graphs contribute in the standard model (SM); one couples the Higgs to $W^+W^-(\sim gM_W)$, and one to $t\bar t(\sim g_{top\;yukawa}=m_t/246\GeV)$. The large Yukawa coupling for $m_t>100\GeV$ makes the second amplitude competitive or dominant for most $M_H,m_t$ values. Thus the Higgs decay rate to single top directly probes the SM universal mechanism generating both gauge boson and fermion masses, and offers a means to infer the Higgs-$t \bar t$ Yukawa coupling when $H\rightarrow t \bar t$ is kinematically disallowed. We find that the modes $pp\rightarrow Xt\bar t(H\rightarrow t\bar b W^{(*)})$ at the SSC, and $e^+ e^-\rightarrow Z\,or\,\nu\bar{\nu} + (H\rightarrow t\bar b W^{(*)})$ at future high energy, high luminosity colliders, may be measureable if $2m_t$ is not too far above $M_H$. We classify non-standard Higgses as gaugeo-phobic, fermio-phobic or fermio-philic, and discuss the Higgs$\rightarrow$ single top rates for these classes. "
"The calculation of the one-loop induced decay rate b -> s \gamma is improved by including radiative corrections to the charged Higgs mass and to the charged-Higgs-fermion-fermion vertex. It is shown how the radiative corrections modify the excluded zone in the \tan\beta-m_A plane, imposed by the non-observation of this decay. In particular, a light CP-odd Higgs at large \tan\beta becomes allowed. "
"It is shown that the nuclear effects playing a relevant role in Deep Inelastic Scattering of polarized electrons by polarized $^3$He are mainly those arising from the effective proton and neutron polarizations generated by the $S'$ and $D$ waves in $^3$He. A simple and reliable equation relating the neutron, $g_1^n$, and $^3$He, $g_1^3$, spin structure functions is proposed. It is shown that the measurement of the first moment of the $^3$He structure function can provide a significant check of the Bjorken Sum Rule. "
"We identify a quantity in the $c=1$ matrix model which describes the wavefunction for physical scattering of a tachyon from a black hole of the two dimensional critical string theory. At the semiclassical level this quantity corresponds to the usual picture of a wave coming in from infinity, part of which enters the black hole becoming singular at the singularity, while the rest is scattered back to infinity, with nothing emerging from the whitehole. We find, however, that the exact nonperturbative wavefunction is nonsingular at the singularity and appears to end up in the asymptotic region ``behind'' the singularity. "
"Recently, Rogers' dilogarithm identities have attracted much attention in the setting of conformal field theory as well as lattice model calculations. One of the connecting threads is an identity of Richmond-Szekeres that appeared in the computation of central charges in conformal field theory. We show that the Richmond-Szekeres identity and its extension by Kirillov-Reshetikhin can be interpreted as a lift of a generator of the third integral homology of a finite cyclic subgroup sitting inside the projective special linear group of all $2 \times 2$ real matrices viewed as a {\it discrete} group. This connection allows us to clarify a few of the assertions and conjectures stated in the work of Nahm-Recknagel-Terhoven concerning the role of algebraic $K$-theory and Thurston's program on hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Specifically, it is not related to hyperbolic 3-manifolds as suggested but is more appropriately related to the group manifold of the universal covering group of the projective special linear group of all $2 \times 2$ real matrices viewed as a topological group. This also resolves the weaker version of the conjecture as formulated by Kirillov. We end with the summary of a number of open conjectures on the mathematical side. "
"We analyze actions for 2D supergravities induced by chiral conformal supermatter. The latter may be thought as described at the classical level by superspace actions invariant under super-reparametrization, super-Weyl and super-Lorentz transformations. Upon quantization various anomalies appear which characterize the non-trivial induced actions for the supergravitational sector. We derive these induced actions using a chiral boson to represent the chiral inducing matter. We show that they can be defined in a super-reparametrization invariant way, but with super-Weyl and super-Lorentz anomalies. We consider the case of $(1,0)$ and $(1,1)$ supergravities by working in their respective superspace formulations and investigate their quantization in the conformal gauge. The actions we consider arise naturally in off-critical heterotic and spinning strings. In the conformal gauge, they correspond to chiral extensions of the super-Liouville theory. "
This paper generalises King's models for tidally truncated star clusters by including approximately the non-spherical symmetry of the tidal field and the resulting non-spherical distortion of the cluster. 
"We study the subdivision properties of certain lattice gauge theories based on the groups $Z_{2}$ and $Z_{3}$, in four dimensions. The Boltzmann weights are shown to be invariant under all type $(k,l)$ subdivision moves, at certain discrete values of the coupling parameter. The partition function then provides a combinatorial invariant of the underlying simplicial complex, at least when there is no boundary. We also show how an extra phase factor arises when comparing Boltzmann weights under the Alexander moves, where the boundary undergoes subdivision. "
"The positive-energy unitary irreducible representations of the $q$-deformed conformal algebra ${\cal C}_q = {\cal U}_q(su(2,2))$ are obtained by appropriate deformation of the classical ones. When the deformation parameter $q$ is $N$-th root of unity, all these unitary representations become finite-dimensional. For this case we discuss in some detail the massless representations, which are also irreducible representations of the $q$-deformed Poincar\'e subalgebra of ${\cal C}_q$. Generically, their dimensions are smaller than the corresponding finite-dimensional non-unitary representation of $su(2,2)$, except when $N=2$, $h=0$ and $N = 2 \vert h\vert +1$, where $h$ is the helicity of the representations. The latter cases include the fundamental representations with $h = \pm 1/2$. "
"We use the recently calculated two--loop anomalous dimensions of current-current operators, QCD and electroweak penguin operators to construct the effective Hamiltonian for $\Delta S=1$ transitions beyond the leading logarithmic approximation. We solve the renormalization group equations and give the numerical values of Wilson coeff. functions. We propose a new semi-phenomenological approach to hadronic matrix elements which incorporates the data for $CP$-conserving $K \rightarrow \pi\pi$ amplitudes and allows to determine the matrix elements of all $(V-A)\otimes (V-A)$ operators in any renormalization scheme and do a renormalization group analysis of all hadronic matrix elements $\langle Q_i(\mu) \rangle$. We compare critically our treatment of these matrix elements with those given in the literature. We find in the NDR scheme $\epe = (6.7 \pm 2.6)\times 10^{-4}$ in agreement with the experimental findings of E731. We point out however that the increase of $\langle Q_6 \rangle$ by only a factor of two gives $\epe = (20.0 \pm 6.5)\times 10^{-4}$ in agreement with the result of NA31. The dependence of $\epe$ on $\Lambda_{\bar{MS}}$, $m_t$ and $\langle Q_{6,8} \rangle$ is presented. "
"We consider here the Chern-Simons field theory with gauge group SU(N) in the presence of a gravitational background that describes a two-dimensional expanding ``universe"". Two special cases are treated here in detail: the spatially flat {\it Robertson-Walker} space-time and the conformally static space-times having a general closed and orientable Riemann surface as spatial section. The propagator and the vertices are explicitely computed at the lowest order in perturbation theory imposing the Coulomb gauge fixing. "
"We present the results of theoretical analysis of normal impurities effects in superconductors with the gap being an odd function of k-k_{F}. This model proposed by Mila and Abrahams leads to the possibility of pairing in the presence of arbitrarily strong short-range repulsion between electrons and may be applied to high-Tc oxides.However, we demonstrate that normal impurities lead to rather strong suppression of this type of pairing, which is actually stronger than in the case of magnetic impurities in traditional superconductors. Relative stability of high-Tc cuprates to disordering makes this model a rather unlikely candidate for the pairing mechanism in these systems. "
"We assess the relative contribution to the COBE - measured microwave anisotropy arising both from relic gravity waves as well as primordial density perturbations originating during inflation. We show that the gravity wave contribution to the CMBR anisotropy depends sensitively upon $n$ -- the primordial spectral index ($\dk^2 \propto k^n$), increasing as $n$ deviates from a Harrison - Zeldovich spectrum (n = 1). As a result, for $n < 0.84$ the contribution from gravity waves towards $\delta T/ T $ is greater than the corresponding contribution from density perturbations, whereas for $n > 0.84$ the reverse is true. ($ n = 0.84$ corresponds to an expansion index $p = 13.5$ in models with power-law inflation $a \propto t^p$. ) Our results show that for a scale-invariant Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum generated by chaotic inflation, gravity waves contribute approximately $24\%$ to the CMBR anisotropy measured by COBE. Applying our results to the cold dark matter scenario for galaxy formation, we find that in general CDM models with tilted power spectra ($n < 1$), require the biasing parameter to be greater than unity, on scales of $16h_{50}^{-1} Mpc$. We also obtain an expression for the COBE - normalised amplitude and spectrum of the stochastic gravity wave background and compare it with the sensitivity of planned laser-interferometer gravity wave detectors. "
"Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies that result from quantum fluctuations during inflation are explored and the impact of their ``cosmic variance'' on the ability to use existing data to probe inflationary models is studied. We calculate the rms temperature fluctuation, and its cosmic variance, for a number of experiments and for models with primordial power spectra which range from $n={1\over 2}$ to $1$. We find: (1) cosmic variance obscures the information which can be extracted, so a comparison of the rms temperature fluctuation on small scales with the COBE result can fix $n$ to only $\approx\pm 0.2$ at best; (2) measurements of the rms fluctuation on $1^{\circ}$ scales may not allow one to unambiguously infer the tensor contribution to the COBE anisotropy; (3) comparison of this contribution with the predictions of inflation are ambiguous if the quadrupole anisotropy alone is utilized. We discuss means for minimizing the uncertainty due to cosmic variance in comparisons between experiments. "
"The two parameters quantum algebra $SU_{p,k}(2)$ can be obtained from a single parameter algebra $SU_q(2)$. This fact gives some relations between $SU_{p,k}(2)$ quantities and the corresponding ones of the $SU_q(2)$ algebra. In this paper are mentioned the relations concerning: Casimir operators, eigenvectors, matrix elements, Clebsch Gordan coefficients and irreducible tensors. "
"We study the decoherence properties of a certain class of Markovian quantum open systems from both the Decohering Histories and Environment Induced Superselection paradigms. The class studied includes many familiar quantum optical cases. For this class, we show that there always exists a basis which leads to {\em exactly} consistent histories for any coarse graining {\em irrespective} of the initial conditions. The magnitude of the off--diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix $\rho$ in this basis however, depends on the initial conditions. Necessary requirements for classicality as advanced by the two paradigms are thus in direct conflict in these systems. "
"We investigate on the lattice the Yukawa models in 2 dimensions with Z(2) and U(1) symmetries. These models reduce to the usual and chiral Gross-Neveu models, respectively, when the kinetic and the selfcoupling terms of the scalar field are turned off. The numerical data and mean field arguments suggest that, at least for some range of the scalar field hopping parameter, fermion mass is dynamically generated for arbitrarily weak Yukawa coupling. The models are asymptotically free in this coupling, like the Gross-Neveu models, even when the scalar quartic selfcoupling is strong. "
"We reformulate the symmetries of Gurses [Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 367 (1993)] in a more abstract, more geometrical manner. The type (b) transformation of \gurses\ is related to a diffeomorphism of the differentiable manifold onto itself. The type (c) symmetry is replaced by a more general type (c-bar) symmetry that has the nice property that the commutator of a type (c-bar) generator with a type (a) generator is itself of type (c-bar). We identify a differential constraint that transformations of type (c) and (c-bar) must satisfy, and which, in our opinion, may severely limit the usefulness of these transformations. "
"A generic outcome of theories with scalar-tensor coupling is the existence of inflationary attractors, either power-law or de Sitter. The fluctuations arising during this phase are Gaussian and their spectrum depends on the wavenumber $k$ according to the power-law $k^{1/(1-p)}$, where $p$ is the inflationary power-law exponent. We investigate to which extent these properties depend on the coupling function and on the potential. We find the class of models in which viable attractors exist. Within this class, we find that the cosmic expansion and the scaling of the fluctuation spectrum are independent of the coupling function. Further, the analytical solution of the Fokker-Planck equation shows that the deviations from Gaussianity are negligible. "
"We give exact relations for a number of amplitude combinations that occur in the study of self-avoiding walks, polygons and lattice trails. In particular, we elucidate the lattice-dependent factors which occur in those combinations which are otherwise universal, show how these are modified for oriented lattices, and give new results for amplitude ratios involving even moments of the area of polygons. We also survey numerical results for a wide range of amplitudes on a number of oriented and regular lattices, and provide some new ones. "
"We show that for collinear processes, i.e. processes where the incoming and outgoing momenta are aligned along the same line, the S-matrix of the tree level 2+1 dimensional Thirring model factorizes: any S - matrix element is a product of $2\rightarrow 2$ elements. In particular this means nullification of all collinear $2 \rightarrow n$ amplitudes for $n > 2$. "
"We report far infrared transmission measurements on single crystal samples derived from Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8}$. The impurity scattering rate of the samples was varied by electron-beam irradiation, 50MeV $^{16}$O$^{+6}$ ion irradiation, heat treatment in vacuum, and Y doping. Although substantial changes in the infrared spectra were produced, in no case was a feature observed that could be associated with the superconducting energy gap. These results all but rule out ``clean limit'' explanations for the absence of the spectroscopic gap in this material, and provide evidence that the superconductivity in Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8}$ is gapless. "
"We show that in 2+1 dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics an external magnetic field applied to a finite density of massless fermions is screened, due to a $2+1$-dimensional realization of the underlying $2$-dimensional axial anomaly of the space components of the electric current. This is shown to imply screening of the magnetic field, i.e., the Meissner effect. We discuss the physical implications of this result. "
The low-temperature thermoelectric power of the repulsive-interaction one-dimensional Hubbard model is calculated using an asymptotic Bethe ansatz for holons and spinons. The competition between the entropy carried by the holons and that carried by the backflow of the spinons gives rise to an unusual temperature and doping dependence of the thermopower which is qualitatively similar to that observed in the normal state of high-$T_{c}$ superconductors. 
"An analysis by the ATLAS Collaboration has recently shown, contrary to popular belief, that a combination of strategic cuts, excellent mass resolution, and detailed knowledge of the QCD backgrounds from direct measurements can be used to extract a signal in the $Z' \to jj$ channel in excess of $6\sigma$ for certain classes of extended electroweak models. We explore the possibility that the data extracted from $Z$ dijet peak will have sufficient statistical power as to supply information on the couplings of the $Z'$ provided it is used in conjunction with complimentary results from the $Z' \to \ell^+ \ell^-$ `discovery' channel. We show, for a 1 TeV $Z'$ produced at the SSC, that this technique can provide a powerful new tool with which to identify the origin of $Z'$'s. "
"We derive the recursive equations for the form factors of the local hermitian operators in the Bullough-Dodd model. At the self-dual point of the theory, the form factors of the fundamental field of the Bullough-Dodd model are equal to those of the fundamental field of the Sinh-Gordon model at a specific value of the coupling constant. "
"We prove that if A is the basin of immediate attraction to a periodic attracting or parabolic point for a rational map f on the Riemann sphere, if $A$ is completely invariant (i.e. $f^{-1}(A)=A$), and if $\mu$ is an arbitrary $f$-invariant measure with positive Lyapunov exponents on the boundary of $A$, then $\mu$-almost every point $q$ in the boundary of $A$ is accessible along a curve from $A$. In fact we prove the accessability of every ""good"" $q$ i.e. such $q$ for which ""small neighbourhoods arrive at large scale"" under iteration of $f$. This generalizes Douady-Eremenko-Levin-Petersen theorem on the accessability of periodic sources. "
We review our work on the relation between integrability and infinite-dimensional algebras. We first consider the question of what sets of commuting charges can be constructed from the current of a \mbox{\sf U}(1) Kac-Moody algebra. It emerges that there exists a set $S_n$ of such charges for each positive integer $n>1$; the corresponding value of the central charge in the Feigin-Fuchs realization of the stress tensor is $c=13-6n-6/n$. The charges in each series can be written in terms of the generators of an exceptional \W-algebra. We show that the \W-algebras that arise in this way are symmetries of Liouville theory for special values of the coupling. We then exhibit a relationship between the \nls equation and the KP hierarchy. From this it follows that there is a relationship between the \nls equation and the algebra \Wi. These examples provide evidence for our conjecture that the phenomenon of integrability is intimately linked with properties of infinite dimensional algebras. 
"Spinning particles in curved space-time can have fermionic symmetries generated by the square root of bosonic constants of motion other than the Hamiltonian. We present a general analysis of the conditions under which such new supersymmetries appear, and discuss the Poisson-Dirac algebra of the resulting set of charges, including the conditions of closure of the new algebra. An example of a new non-trivial supersymmetry is found in black-hole solutions of the Kerr-Newman type and corresponds to the Killing-Yano tensor, which plays an important role in solving the Dirac equation in these black-hole metrics. "
"We study the problem of classifying the irreducible projective varieties $X$ of dimension $n\ge 2$ in $\Bbb P^N$ which contain an algebraic family $\Cal F$ of dimension $h+1$ ($h<n$) of subvarieties $Y$ of dimension $n-h$, each one contained in a $\Bbb P^{N-h-1}$. We prove that one of the following happens: (i) there exists an integer $r$, $r<N-n$ such that $X$ is contained in a variety $V_r$ of dimension at most $N-r$ containing a family of dimension $h+1$ of subvarieties of dimension $N-h-r$, each one contained in a linear space of dimension $N-h-1$; (ii) The degree of $Y$ is bounded by a function of $h$ and $N-n$ (in this case $X$ is called of isolated type). Successively we study some special cases; in particular we give a complete classification of surfaces in $\Bbb P^5$ containing a family of dimension $2$ of curves of $\Bbb P^3$. "
"Generalizing the mapping between the Potts model with nearest neighbor interaction and six vertex model, we build a family of ""fused Potts models"" related to the spin $k/2$ ${\rm U}_{q}{\rm su}(2)$ invariant vertex model and quantum spin chain. These Potts model have still variables taking values $1,\ldots,Q$ ($\sqrt{Q}=q+q^{-1}$) but they have a set of complicated multi spin interactions. The general technique to compute these interactions, the resulting lattice geometry, symmetries, and the detailed examples of $k=2,3$ are given. For $Q>4$ spontaneous magnetizations are computed on the integrable first order phase transition line, generalizing Baxter's results for $k=1$. For $Q\leq 4$, we discuss the full phase diagram of the spin one ($k=2$) anisotropic and ${\rm U}_{q}{\rm su}(2)$ invariant quantum spin chain (it reduces in the limit $Q=4$ ($q=1$) to the much studied phase diagram of the isotropic spin one quantum chain). Several critical lines and massless phases are exhibited. The appropriate generalization of the Valence Bond State method of Affleck et al. is worked out. "
"The parametric equations of KAM tori for a quasi integrable system, are shown to be one point Schwinger functions of a suitable euclidean quantum field theory on the torus. KAM theorem is equivalent to a ultraviolet stability theorem. A renormalization group treatment of the field theory leads to a resummation of the formal pertubation series and to an expansion in terms of new parameters (identified as a family of renormalization constants). The new parameters are analytic in the coupling (at small coupling): the breakdown of the tori at large coupling is speculated to be related to the crossing of a ""critical"" surface at a value where the renormalization constants are still finite. A mechanism for the possible universality of the singularities of parametric equations for the invariant tori, in their parameter dependence as well as in the coupling dependence, is proposed.} "
We study the non-equilibrium relaxation of the spherical spin-glass model with p-spin interactions in the $N \rightarrow \infty$ limit. We analytically solve the asymptotics of the magnetization and the correlation and response functions for long but finite times. Even in the thermodynamic limit the system exhibits `weak' (as well as `true') ergodicity breaking and aging effects. We determine a functional Parisi-like order parameter $P_d(q)$ which plays a similar role for the dynamics to that played by the usual function for the statics. 
We argue that purely local experiments can distinguish a stationary charged particle in a static gravitational field from an accelerated particle in (gravity-free) Minkowski space. Some common arguments to the contrary are analyzed and found to rest on a misidentification of ``energy''. 
It is shown that if a representation of a *-algebra on a vector space $V$ is an irreducible *-representation with respect to some inner product on $V$ then under appropriate technical conditions this property determines the inner product uniquely up to a constant factor. Ashtekar has suggested using the condition that a given representation of the algebra of quantum observables is a *-representation to fix the inner product on the space of physical states. This idea is of particular interest for the quantisation of gravity where an obvious prescription for defining an inner product is lacking. The results of this paper show rigorously that Ashtekar's criterion does suffice to determine the inner product in very general circumstances. Two versions of the result are proved: a simpler one which only applies to representations by bounded operators and a more general one which allows for unbounded operators. Some concrete examples are worked out in order to illustrate the meaning and range of applicability of the general theorems. 
"We study the quantum foundations of a theory of large amplitude collective motion for a Hamiltonian expressed in terms of canonical variables. In previous work the separation into slow and fast (collective and non-collective) variables was carried out without the explicit intervention of the Born Oppenheimer approach. The addition of the Born Oppenheimer assumption not only provides support for the results found previously in leading approximation, but also facilitates an extension of the theory to include an approximate description of the fast variables and their interaction with the slow ones. Among other corrections, one encounters the Berry vector and scalar potential. The formalism is illustrated with the aid of some simple examples, where the potentials in question are actually evaluated and where the accuracy of the Born Oppenheimer approximation is tested. Variational formulations of both Hamiltonian and Lagrangian type are described for the equations of motion for the slow variables. "
"The normal phase of the high-$T_c$ cuprates is apparently not described by Fermi liquid theory. It has been proposed that a dynamically generated gauge field must appear in the effective field theory. Even a simple spinon-gauge system is complicated, becoming strongly coupled at low energy. We show that in a large-$n$ approximation the theory can be solved and has a nontrivial fixed point. Also, we find that there is no antiferromagnetic instability at weak coupling. "
"If a fermion is travelling through a medium, it can have matter-induced magnetic and electric dipole moments. These contributions conserve chirality, and can be non-vanishing even for a Majorana neutrino. Several implications for neutrino physics are discussed. "
"The jet-jet profile, or detailed manner, in which transverse energy and mass are distributed around the jet-jet system resulting from the hadronic decay of a $Z$ boson in the process Higgs$\to ZZ$ at a proton-proton collider energy of $40\tev$ is carefully examined. Two observables are defined that can be used to help distinguish the $\ell^+\ell^-$-jet-jet signal from Higgs decay from the ``ordinary'' QCD background arising from the large transverse momentum production of single $Z$ bosons plus the associated jets. By making cuts on these observables, signal to background enhancement factors greater than $100$ can be obtained. "
"In this papper, a quantum dynamical model describing the quantum measurement process is presented as an extensive generalization of the Coleman-Hepp model. In both the classical limit with very large quantum number and macroscopic limit with very large particle number in measuring instrument, this model generally realizes the wave packet collapse in quantum measurement as a consequence of the Schrodinger time evolution in either the exactly-solvable case or the non-(exactly-)solvable case. For the latter, its quasi-adiabatic case is explicitly analysed by making use of the high-order adiabatic approximation method and then manifests the wave packet collapse as well as the exactly-solvable case. By highlighting these analysis, it is finally found that an essence of the dynamical model of wave packet collapse is the factorization of the Schrodinger evolution other than the exact solvability. So many dynamical models including the well-known ones before, which are exactly-solvable or not, can be shown only to be the concrete realizations of this factorizability "
"We study two families of excitable cellular automata known as the Greenberg-Hastings Model (GHM) and the Cyclic Cellular Automaton (CCA). Each family consists of local deterministic oscillating lattice dynamics, with parallel discrete-time updating, parametrized by the range of interaction, the ""shape"" of its neighbor set, threshold value for contact updating, and number of possible states per site. GHM and CCA are mathematically tractable prototypes for the spatially distributed periodic wave activity of so-called excitable media observed in diverse disciplines of experimental science. Earlier work by Fisch, Gravner, and Griffeath studied the ergodic behavior of these excitable cellular automata on Z^2, and identified two distinct (but closely-related) elaborate phase portraits as the parameters vary. In particular, they noted the emergence of asymptotic phase diagrams (and Euclidean dynamics) in a well-defined threshold-range scaling limit. In this study we present several rigorous results and some experimental findings concerning various phase transitions in the asymptotic diagrams, focusing on evaluating the limiting threshold cutoff for existence of the spirals that characterize many excitable media. For mathematical expediency our main results are formulated in terms of spo(p), the cutoff for existence of stable periodic objects that arise as spiral cores. "
I review the current limits on the mixing of ordinary and exotic fermions. 
"Generalizing the original work by Hodges and Blumenthal, we outline a formalism which allows one, in principle, to reconstruct the potential of the inflaton field from knowledge of the tensor gravitational wave spectrum or the scalar density fluctuation spectrum, with special emphasis on the importance of the tensor spectrum. We provide some illustrative examples of such reconstruction. We then discuss in some detail the question of whether one can use real observations to carry out this procedure. We conclude that in practice, a full reconstruction of the functional form of the potential will not be possible within the foreseeable future. However, with a knowledge of the dark matter components, it should soon be possible to combine intermediate-scale data with measurements of large-scale cosmic microwave background anisotropies to yield useful information regarding the potential. "
"The complete set of ground state wave functions for N anyons in an external magnetic field on the torus is found. The cases when the filling factor is less than or equal to one are considered. The single valued description of anyons is employed through out by coupling bosons to a Chern-Simons field. At the end, the Chern-Simons interaction is removed by a singular gauge transformation as a result of which the wave functions become multi-component in agreement with other studies. "
"[[ RM: A review paper on cycle expansions. I quote the introduction: in section (2) ]] I will summarize Gutzwiller's theory for the spectrum of eigenenergies and extend it to diagonal matrix elements as well. The derivation of the associated zeta function is given (2.2) and the identification of suitable scaling variables discussed (2.3). In section 3 tools necessary for the organization of chaos will be discussed: symbolic dynamics (3.1), the connectivity matrix (3.3), the topological zeta function (3.4) and general transfer matrices and zeta functions (3.5). Although illustrated for the case of hard collisions in a billiard, the symbolic dynamics can be extended to `smooth collisions' in smooth potentials (3.2). In systems with discrete symmetries, zeta functions factorize into zeta functions on invariant subspaces. This symmetry factorization and the associated reduction in symbolics is discussed in section 4. The ideas developed here are illustrated for the example of a free particle reflected elastically off three disks in section 5. Methods to find periodic orbits (5.1), the convergence of the trace formula (5.2), the semiclassical computation of scattering resonances (5.3), the convergence of the cycle expansion (5.4) and methods to obtain eigenvalues of the bounded billiard (5.5) are discussed. The relevant parts of a classical periodic orbit theory are developed in section 6.1, including a discussion of escape rates and the Hannay-Ozorio de Almeida sum rule (6.2). Finally, the issue of semiclassical matrix elements is taken up again and applications to experiments are discussed. "
"The simplest model that can accomodate a viable nonbaryonic dark matter candidate is the standard electroweak theory with the addition of right-handed or sterile neutrinos. We reexamine this model and find that the sterile neutrinos can be either hot, warm, or cold dark matter. Since their only direct coupling is to left-handed or active neutrinos, the most efficient production mechanism is via neutrino oscillations. If the production rate is always less than the expansion rate, then these neutrinos will never be in thermal equilibrium. However, enough of them may be produced so that they provide the missing mass necessary for closure. We consider a single generation of neutrino fields $\left (\nu_L,\,\nu_R\right )$ with a Dirac mass, $\mu$, and a Majorana mass for the right-handed components only, $M$. For $M\gg \mu$ we show that the number density of sterile neutrinos is proportional to $\mu^2/M$ so that the energy density today is {\it independent of} $M$. However $M$ is crucial in determining the large scale structure of the Universe. In particular, $M\simeq 0.1-1.0 {\rm ~keV}$ leads to warm dark matter and a structure formation scenario that may have some advantages over both the standard hot and cold dark matter scenarios. "
"In two recent papers, a new method was developed for calculating ten-dimensional superstring amplitudes with an arbitrary number of loops and external massless particles, and for expressing them in manifestly Lorentz-invariant form. By explicitly checking for divergences when the Riemann surface degenerates, these amplitudes are proven to be finite. By choosing light-cone moduli for the surface and comparing with the light-cone Green-Schwarz formalism, these amplitudes are proven to be unitary. "
The phenomenon of stabilization of highly excited states of hydrogen atom in a strong monochromatic field is discussed. Approximate description of dynamics by the introduced Kramers map allows to understand the main properties of this phenomenon on the basis of analogy with the Kepler map. Analogy between the stabilization and the channeling of particles in a crystal is also discussed. 
"We formulate a renormalizable quantum gravity in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions by generalizing the nonlinear sigma model approach to string theory. We find that the theory possesses the ultraviolet stable fixed point if the central charge of the matter sector is in the range $0~<~c~<~25$. This may imply the existence of consistent quantum gravity theory in 3 and 4 dimensions. We compute the scaling dimensions of the relevant operators in the theory at the ultraviolet fixed point. We obtain a scaling relation between the cosmological constant and the gravitational constant, which is crucial for searching for the continuum limit in the constructive approach to quantum gravity. "
"The Greenberg-Hastings Model (GHM) is a family of multitype cellular automata that emulate excitable media, exhibiting the nucleation and spiral formation characteristic of such complex systems. In this paper we study the asymptotic frequency of nucleation in 2-d GHM dynamics as the number k of types, or colors, becomes large. Starting from uniform product measure over colors, and assuming that the excitation threshold is not too large, the box size needed for formation of a spiral core is shown to grow exponentially in k. By exploiting connections with percolation theory we find that a box of size exp{(.23+-.06)k} is required in the nearest neighbor, threshold 1 case. In contrast, GHM rules obey power law nucleation scaling when started from a suitable non-uniform product measure over the k colors; this effect is driven by critical percolation. Finally, we present some analogous results for a Random GHM, an interacting Markovian system closely related to the epidemic with regrowth of Durrett and Neuhauser. "
"We discuss the effects of mixing of scalars belonging to left-- and right--chiral MSSM super--multiplets on the process ${g}{g}\rightarrow \hnl \rightarrow \ga\ga$, which is a promising channel for the discovery of the lightest CP--even MSSM Higgs boson at the LHC and the SSC. The effects of the left--right scalar mixing are small in most of parameter space. However, there exist regions where the mixing is important. Due to mixing, there can be large enhancements of the cross section in a region of parameter space where the no--mixing approximation yields a value that is too low for experimental discovery of the $\hnl$ at the LHC and the SSC. "
"The vacuum stability lower bound on the mass of the Higgs boson is numerically investigated in an $SU(2)_L \otimes SU(2)_R$ symmetric Yukawa model, which describes two heavy degenerate fermion doublets in the limit of vanishing gauge couplings. Good agreement with perturbation theory is found, although the couplings are strong. The upper bound on the fermion mass and renormalized Yukawa coupling is also determined in the part of bare parameter space where reflection positivity has been proven. "
"We examine the electroweak breaking mechanism in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) using the {\em complete} one-loop effective potential $V_1$. First, we study what is the region of the whole MSSM parameter space (i.e. $M_{1/2},m_o,\mu,...$) that leads to a succesful $SU(2)\times U(1)$ breaking with an acceptable top quark mass. In doing this it is observed that all the one-loop corrections to $V_1$ (even the apparently small ones) must be taken into account in order to get reliable results. We find that the allowed region of parameters is considerably enhanced with respect to former ""improved"" tree level results. Next, we study the fine-tuning problem associated with the high sensitivity of $M_Z$ to $h_t$ (the top Yukawa coupling). Again, we find that this fine-tuning is appreciably smaller once the one-loop effects are considered than in previous tree level calculations. Finally, we explore the ambiguities and limitations of the ordinary criterion to estimate the degree of fine-tuning. As a result of all this, the upper bounds on the MSSM parameters, and hence on the supersymmetric masses, are substantially raised, thus increasing the consistency between supersymmetry and observation. "
The connection is obtained between Ward identities and W-constraints in Generalized Kontsevich Model with the potential $X^4/4$. We show that Ward identities include W-constraints (and do not include any other constraints) for this potential and make some observations in favour of the same connection for the model with the potential of the form $X^{(K+1)}/(K+1)$ for any $K\geq 2$. 
"Scaling properties of a self-dual field-theoretical model, describing two weakl$spinless Luttinger chains, are studied. A crossover to a sine-Gordon massive phase, with strongly developed two-particleinterchain correlations, is described. It is argued that, in a wide range of the in-chain interaction, renormalization of the interchain hopping amplitude is determined by the Luttinger liquid effects. "
"The incompressible fluid dynamics is reformulated as dynamics of closed loops $C$ in coordinate space. This formulation allows to derive explicit functional equation for the generating functional $\Psi[C]$ in inertial range of spatial scales, which allows the scaling solutions. The requirement of finite energy dissipation rate leads then to the Kolmogorov index. We find an exact steady solution of the loop equation in inertial range of the loop sizes. The generating functional decreases as $\EXP{-A^{\tt}}$ where $A=\oint_C r \wedge dr$ is the area inside the loop. The pdf for the velocity circulation $\Gamma$ is Lorentzian, with the width $\bar{\Gamma} \propto A^{\tt} $. "
The evolution equation for the expectation values of the Boltzmann factor between valence bond states is evaluated in lowest order of the dimer cluster expansion. Explicit formulas are given for the internal energy and the specific heat of the d-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. 
"In this paper, we study the evolution of a relativistic, superhorizon-sized void embedded in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. We numerically solve the spherically symmetric general relativistic equations in comoving, synchronous coordinates. Initially, the fluid inside the void is taken to be homogeneous and nonexpanding. In a radiation- dominated universe, we find that radiation diffuses into the void at approximately the speed of light as a strong shock---the void collapses. We also find the surprising result that the cosmic collapse time (the $1^{\rm st}$-crossing time) is much smaller than previously thought, because it depends not only on the radius of the void, but also on the ratio of the temperature inside the void to that outside. If the ratio of the initial void radius to the outside Hubble radius is less than the ratio of the outside temperature to that inside, then the collapse occurs in less than the outside Hubble time. Thus, superhorizon-sized relativistic void may thermalize and homogenize relatively quickly. These new simulations revise the current picture of superhorizon-sized void evolution after first-order inflation. "
"We investigate models of `intermediate' inflation, where the scale factor $a(t)$ grows as $a(t) = \exp (A t^f)$, $0 < f < 1$, $A$ constant. These solutions arise as exact analytic solutions for a given class of potentials for the inflaton $\phi$. For a simpler class of potentials falling off as a power of $\phi$ they arise as slow-roll solutions, and in particular they include, for $f = 2/3$, the class of potentials which give the Harrison--Zel'dovich spectrum. The perturbation spectral index $n$ can be greater than unity on astrophysical scales. It is also possible to generate substantial gravitational waves while keeping the scalar spectrum close to scale-invariance; this latter possibility performs well when confronted with most observational data. "
"We determine the versal deformation of cones, in the simplest case: cones over hyperelliptic curves of high degree. In particular, we show that for degree $4g+4$, the highest degree for which interesting deformations exist, the number of smoothing components is $2^{2g+1}$ ($g\neq3$). We review in a general setting the relation of $T^1(-1)$ with Wahl's Gaussian map. We prove that $T^1(-1)$ vanishes for a general curve and an arbitrary embedding line bundle of degree at least $2g+11$. To find $T^2$ for hyperelliptic cones with the Main Lemma of [Behnke--Christophersen], we compute $T^1$ for the cone over $d$ points on a rational normal curve of degree $d-g-1$, using explicit equations. Actually, the equations for the cone over a hyperelliptic curve have a nice structure. We give an interpretation of $T^2(-2)$ in terms of this structure. Smoothing components are related to surfaces with $C$ as hyperplane section. An explicit description of the corresponding infinitesimal deformations allowss to conclude that the base space is a complete intersection of degree $2^{2g+1}$. We also consider smoothing data in the sense of [Looijenga--Wahl]. "
"We conceive finite automata as dynamical systems on discontinuum and investigate their factors. Factors of finite automata include many well-known simple dynamical systems, e.g. hyperbolic systems and systems with finite attractors. In the quadratic family on the real interval, factors of finite automata include all systems with finite number of periodic points, as well as systems at the band-merging bifurcations. On the other hand the system with a non-chaotic attractor, which occurs at the limit of the period doubling bifurcations (at the edge of chaos), is not of this class. Next we propose as another simplicity criterion for dynamical systems the property of having chaotic limits (every point belongs to a set, whose $\omega$-limit is chaotic). We show that any factor of a finite automaton has chaotic limits but not vice versa. "
"The path integral for the propagator is expanded into a perturbation series, which can be exactly summed in the case of $\delta$-function perturbations giving a closed expression for the (energy-dependent) Green function. Making the strength of the $\delta$-function perturbation infinite repulsive, produces a totally reflecting boundary, hence giving a path integral solution in half-spaces in terms of the corresponding Green function. The example of the Wood-Saxon potential serves by an appropriate limiting procedure to obtain the Green function for the step-potential and the finite potential-well in the half-space, respectively. "
"We discuss how correlations among momenta of the decay products may yield information about the CP-parity of the Higgs particle. These are correlations of decay planes defined by the momenta of pairs of particles as well as correlations between energy differences. Our study includes finite-width effects. In the narrow-width approximation the angular correlations coincide with previously reported results. The correlations between energy differences turn out to be a much better probe for CP determination than the previously suggested angular correlations, especially for massive Higgs bosons. "
The dynamics of relativistic spinning particles in strong external electromagnetic or gravitational fields is discussed. Spin-orbit coupling is shown to affect such relativistic phenomena as time-dilation and perihelion shift. Possible applications include muon decay in a magnetic field and the dynamics of neutron stars in binary systems. 
"One possible solution to the strong CP problem is that CP is an exact symmetry, spontaneously broken at some scale. Some years ago, Nelson and Barr suggested a mechanism for obtaining $\theta=0$ at tree level in this framework, and showed that radiative corrections were small in some non-supersymmetric models. Further investigations suggested that the same could be true in supersymmetric theories. In this note, we show that these analyses assumed an extraordinarily high degree of degeneracy among squark masses and among other supersymmetry breaking parameters. We argue, using naturalness as well as expectations from string theory, that this is not very plausible. "
"Discrete symmetries of dynamical flows give rise to relations between periodic orbits, reduce the dynamics to a fundamental domain, and lead to factorizations of zeta functions. These factorizations in turn reduce the labor and improve the convergence of cycle expansions for classical and quantum spectra associated with the flow. In this paper the general formalism is developed, with the $N$-disk pinball model used as a concrete example and a series of physically interesting cases worked out in detail. "
"We investigate particle laws of motion derived from nonstandard kinetic actions of a special form. We are guided by a phenomenological scheme--the modified dynamics (MOND)--that imputes the mass discrepancy observed in galactic systems to a departure from Newtonian dynamics below a certain acceleration scale a0. In the limit a0 goes to 0 the theory goes to Newtonian dynamics. In the opposite limit the action becomes proportional to 1/a0. Galilei-invariant such theories must be strongly non-local; this is a blessing, as such theories need not suffer from the illnesses that are endemic to higher-derivative theories. We discuss the possibility that such a modified law of motion is an effective theory resulting from the elimination of degrees of freedom pertaining to the universe at large (the near equality a0=cH0 being a trace of that connection). A virial relation for bounded trajectories is derived. Exact solutions are obtained for circular orbits, which pertain to rotation curves of disk galaxies. We also explore, in passing, theories that depart from the conventional Newtonian dynamics for very low frequencies. The present formulation contrasts, on important accounts, with earlier, modified-gravity formulations. "

A general model of dialton-Maxwell gravity in two dimensions is investigated. The corresponding one-loop effective action and the generalized $\beta$-functions are obtained. A set of models that are fixed points of the renormalization group equations are presented. 
"Magnetic flux quanta, of value h/2e, in long Josephson junctions behave as (quasi) solitons. Fluxon dynamical states are well described by a perturbed sine-Gordon equation model, with boundary conditions determined by the junction geometry and by externally applied magnetic fields, and they give rise to readily measurable physical phenomena, such as step structure in current-voltage characteristics and microwave radiation emission. Devices based on fluxon propagation offer potentially interesting applications as oscillators and amplifiers - as well as digital applica- tions, described elsewhere in this volume - in high performance integrated superconductive circuits.

"In this note we study the mean field equations for the $3d$ Random Field Ising Model. We discuss the phase diagram of the model, and we address the problem of finding if such equations admit more than one solution. We find two different critical values of $\beta$: one where the magnetization takes a non-zero expectation value, and one where we start to have more than one solution to the mean field equation. We find that, inside a given solution, there are no divergent correlation lengths. "
"Making use of inverse Mellin transform techniques for analytical continuation, an elegant proof and an extension of the zeta function regularization theorem is obtained. No series commutations are involved in the procedure; nevertheless the result is naturally split into the same three contributions of very different nature, i.e. the series of Riemann zeta functions and the power and negative exponentially behaved functions, respectively, well known from the original proof. The new theorem deals equally well with elliptic differential operators whose spectrum is not explicitly known. Rigorous results on the asymptoticity of the outcoming series are given, together with some specific examples. Exact analytical formulas, simplifying approximations and numerical estimates for the last of the three contributions (the most difficult to handle) are obtained. As an application of the method, the summation of the series which appear in the analytic computation (for different ranges of temperature) of the partition function of the string ---basic in order to ascertain if QCD is some limit of a string theory--- is PERFORMED. "
"We consider an exclusion process, with particles injected with rate $\alpha$ at the origin and removed with rate $\beta$ at the right boundary of a one-dimensional chain of sites. The particles are allowed to hop onto unoccupied sites, to the right only. For the special case of $\alpha=\beta=1$ the model was solved previously by Derrida et al. Here we extend the solution to general $\alpha,\beta$. The phase diagram obtained from our exact solution differs from the one predicted by the mean field approximation. "
"We study a one-dimensional anisotropic exclusion process describing particles injected at the origin, moving to the right on a chain of $L$ sites and being removed at the (right) boundary. We construct the steady state and compute the density profile, exact expressions for all equal-time n-point density correlation functions and the time-dependent two-point function in the steady state as functions of the injection and absorption rates. We determine the phase diagram of the model and compare our results with predictions from dynamical scaling and discuss some conjectures for other exclusion models. "
An evolution equation for the expectation values of the Boltzmann factor between monomer valence bond states is derived. It contains the whole information on the thermodynamical and magnetic properties of the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ quantum Heisenberg model. A new approximation scheme is proposed and studied in the thermodynamical limit. 
"I summarize the abilities of LEP-II, the SSC/LHC hadron colliders, and a future high energy $\epem$ collider (NLC) to detect the Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM). I then review the unique capabilities of a back-scattered laser beam facility (BSLBF) at the NLC for detecting the heavier neutral Higgs bosons (the $\hh$ and $\ha$) of the MSSM. A BSLBF could well allow $\hh$ and $\ha$ discovery via inclusive $\gam\gam\rta \hh,\ha$ production out to masses of order $0.8\sqrt s$, \ie\ roughly $400\gev$, at the NLC. In addition, a BSLBF allows one to check for CP violation in the neutral Higgs sector; such CP violation is predicted to be absent in the MSSM. (Full postscript file available upon request. Macropackage phyzzx.tex required. To appear in Proceedings of 23rd INFN Eloisatron Workshop.) "
"We study the asymptotic shape of the occupied region for monotone deterministic dynamics in d-dimensional Euclidean space parametrized by a threshold theta, and a Borel set N with positive and finite Lebesgue measure. If A_n denotes the occupied set of the dynamics at integer time n, then A_n+1 is obtained by adjoining any point x for which the volume of overlap between x+N and A_n exceeds theta. Except in some degenerate cases, we prove that A_n converges to a unique limiting ""shape"" L starting from any bounded initial region that is suitably large. Moreover, L is computed as the polar transform for 1/w, where w is an explicit width function that depends on N and theta. It is further shown that L describes the limiting shape of wave fronts for certain cellular automaton growth rules related to lattice models of excitable media, as the threshold and range of interaction increase suitably. In the case of 2-d box neighborhoods, these limiting shapes are calculated and the dependence of their anisotropy on theta is examined. Other specific two- and three- dimensional examples are also discussed in some detail. "
"We clarify the relation between 2-form Einstein gravity and its topological version. The physical space of the topological version is contained in that of the Einstein gravity. Moreover a new vector field is introduced into 2-form Einstein gravity to restore the large symmetry of its topological version. The wave function of the universe is obtained for each model. (Talk given at the Workshop on General Relativity and Gravitation held at Waseda University, January 18-20, 1993.) "
"A general deformation of the Heisenberg algebra is introduced with two deformed operators instead of just one. This is generalised to many variables, and permits the simultaneous existence of coherent states, and the transposition of creation operators. "
"Based on a simple observation that a classical second order differential equation may be decomposed into a set of two first order equations, we introduce a Hamiltonian framework to quantize the damped systems. In particular, we analyze the system of a linear damped harmonic oscillator and demonstrate that the time evolution of the Schr\""odinger equation is unambiguously determined. "
"The implications of recent precision $Z$-pole, $W$ mass, and weak neutral current data for testing the standard electroweak model, constraining the $t$ quark and Higgs masses, \alsz, and grand unification are discussed. A fit to all data yields $\siz = 0.2328 \pm 0.0007$ (\msb) or $\sinn \equiv 1 - \mw^2/\mz^2 = 0.2267 \pm 0.0024$ (on-shell), where the uncertainties are mainly from \mt. In the standard model one predicts $\mt = 150^{+19 + 15}_{-24 - 20}$ GeV, where the central value assumes \mh = 300 GeV and the second uncertainty is for \mh $\ra$ 60 GeV ($-$) or 1 TeV (+). In the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM) one predicts $\mt = 134^{+23}_{-28} \pm 5$ GeV, where the difference is due the light Higgs scalar expected in the MSSM. There is no significant constraint on \mh \ until \mt \ is known independently. "
"A general non-relativistic field theory on the plane with couplings to an arbitrary number of abelian Chern-Simons gauge fields is considered. Elementary excitations of the system are shown to exhibit fractional and mutual statistics. We identify the self-dual systems for which certain classical and quantal aspects of the theory can be studied in a much simplified mathematical setting. Then, specializing to the general self-dual system with two Chern-Simons gauge fields (and non-vanishing mutual statistics parameter), we present a systematic analysis for the static vortexlike classical solutions, with or without uniform background magnetic field. Relativistic generalizations are also discussed briefly. "
It is shown that there exist families of asymptotically flat solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to the Vlasov equation describing a collisionless gas which have a Newtonian limit. These are sufficiently general to confirm that for this matter model as many families of this type exist as would be expected on the basis of physical intuition. A central role in the proof is played by energy estimates in unweighted Sobolev spaces for a wave equation satisfied by the second fundamental form of a maximal foliation. 
"It is possible that the standard model (SM) is replaced around some transition energy $\E_{tr}$ by a new, possibly Higgsless, ``flavor gauge theory'' such that the Yukawa (running) parameters of SM at $E \sim \E_{tr}$ show up an (approximate) flavor democracy (FD). We investigate the latter possibility by studying the renormalization group equations for the Yukawa couplings of SM with one and two Higgs doublets, by evolving them from given physical values at low energies ($E \simeq 1 GeV$) to $\E_{tr}$ ($ \sim \E_{pole}$) and comparing the resulting fermion masses and CKM matrix elements at $E \simeq \E_{tr}$ for various $m_t^{phy}$ and ratios $v_u/v_d$ of vacuum expectation values. We find that the minimal SM and the closely related SM with two Higgs doublets (type I) show increasing deviation from FD when energy is increased, but that SM with two Higgs doublets (type II) clearly tends to FD with increasing energy - in both the quark and the leptonic sector (q-q and l-l FD). Furthermore, we find within the type II model that, for $\E_{pole} \ll \E_{Planck}$, $m_t^{phy}$ can be less than $200 GeV$ in most cases of chosen $v_u/v_d$. Under the assumption that also the corresponding Yukawa couplings in the quark and the leptonic sector at $E \simeq \E_{tr}$ are equal (l-q FD), we derive estimates of bounds on masses of top quark and tau-neutrino, which are compatible with experimental bounds. "
"The relations ${ {|V_{ub}|} \over {|V_{cb}|} } = \sqrt{ { m_u \over m_c } }$ and ${ {|V_{td}|} \over {|V_{ts}|} } = \sqrt{ { m_d \over m_s } }$ are significant successes of some specific models for quark masses. We show that these relations are more general, resulting from a much wider class of models. Consequences of these predictions for CP violating asymmetries in neutral B meson decays are discussed. "
"A canonical quantization for two dimensional gravity models, including a dilaton gravity model, is performed in a way suitable for the light-cone gauge. We extend the theory developed by Abdalla {\it et.al.}\cite{AM} and obtain the correlation functions by using the screening charges of the symmetry algebra. It turns out that the role of the cosmological constant term in the Liouville theory is played by the screening charge of the symmetry algebra and the resulting theory looks like a chiral part of the Liouville theory or a non-critical open string theory. Moreover, we show that the dilaton gravity theory has a symmetry realized by the centrally extended Poincar\'{e} algebra instead of the $\slr$ Kac-Moody algebra which is a symmetry of an ordinary two dimensional gravity theory. "
"We point out that at future hadron colliders the ratio of cross sections for $pp\to Z'\to \ell^+\ell^-$ in two rapidity bins is a useful probe of the relative couplings of the $Z'$ to $u$ and $d$ quarks. Combined with the forward-backward asymmetry, the rare decay modes $Z'\to W \ell\nu_\ell$, and three associated productions $pp\to Z'V$ ($V=Z,W,\gamma$), and assuming inter-family universality, small $Z-Z'$ mixing, and the $Z'$ charge commuting with the $SU_{2L}$ generators, three out of four normalized couplings could be extracted. An analysis of the statistical uncertainties expected for the above probes at the LHC for typical models with $M_{Z'}\simeq1$ TeV shows that one lepton coupling and two combinations of quark couplings could be determined to around 5\%, 20\%, and 30\%, respectively. This allows for a clear distinction between models. "
"An invariant definition of the operator $\Delta $ of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism is proposed. It is defined as the divergence of a Hamiltonian vector field with an odd Poisson bracket (antibracket). Its main properties, which follow from this definition, as well as an example of realization on K\""ahlerian supermanifolds, are considered. The geometrical meaning of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism is discussed. "
We consider experimental signatures of the standard model's minimal supersymmetric extension with a continuous $U(1)_R$ symmetry (MR model). We focus on the ability of existing and planned electron-positron colliders to probe this model and to distinguish it from both the standard model and the standard model's minimal supersymmetric extension with a discrete $R$-parity. 
"The spectral properties of up to four interacting electrons confined within a quasi one--dimensional system of finite length are determined by numerical diagonalization including the spin degree of freedom. The ground state energy is investigated as a function of the electron number and of the system length. The limitations of a description in terms of a capacitance are demonstrated. The energetically lowest lying excitations are physically explained as vibrational and tunneling modes. The limits of a dilute, Wigner-type arrangement of the electrons, and a dense, more homogeneous charge distribution are discussed. "
"We point out that the rare decay mode $W^{\pm} \rightarrow \gamma + D^{\pm}_{s} $ could be spectacularly enhanced, with a branching ratio around $10^{-6} $ which is three order of magnitude larger than previous predictions. Its observation will determine the W boson mass with great accuracy, providing additional high precision tests of the standard model, as well as reveal eventual deviation from the trilinear non-abelian gauge coupling. "
"The theory of matrix models is reviewed from the point of view of its relation to integrable hierarchies. Discrete 1-matrix, 2-matrix, ``conformal'' (multicomponent) and Kontsevich models are considered in some detail, together with the Ward identites (``W-constraints''), determinantal formulas and continuum limits, taking one kind of models into another. Subtle points and directions of the future research are also discussed. "
"In the first part of these lectures, I consider chiral perturbation theory in the presence of matter fields. It allows to systematically work out the consequences of the broken chiral symmetry of QCD. As examples, threshold pion photo- and electroproduction and (spin-flip) nucleon Compton scattering are considered. The second part deals with the quark structure of the nucleon at low energies. The various electromagnetic and weak form factors are discussed. It is shown how parity-violating electron and (anti)neutrino scattering off nucleons and nuclei can be used as a tool to pin down strange matrix elements of the proton. The calculation of QED, QCD and heavy quark corrections to these processes is also touched upon. (Lectures given at the XXXII. Internationale Universit{\""a}tswochen f{\""u}r Kern- und Teilchenphysik, Schladming, Austria, February 24- March 5, 1993). "
"As a preparation for the study of {\it arbitrary} extensions of $d=2$ gravity we present a detailed investigation of $SO(N)$ supergravity. By gauging a chiral, nilpotent subgroup of the $OSp(N|2)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model we obtain an all order expression for the effective action. Reality of the coupling constant imposes the usual restrictions on $c$ for $N=0$ and 1. No such restrictions appear for $N\geq 2$. For $N=2$, 3 and 4, no renormalizations of the coupling constant beyond one loop occur. These results are related to non-renormalization theorems for theories with extended supersymmetries. Arbitrary (super)extensions of $d=2$ gravity are then analyzed. The induced theory is represented by a WZW model for which a chiral, solvable group is gauged. From this, we obtain the effective action. All order expressions for both the coupling constant renormalization and the wavefunction renormalization are given. From this we classify all extensions of $d=2$ gravity for which the coupling constant gets at most a one loop renormalization. As an application of the general strategy, $N=4$ theories based on $D(2,1,\a)$ and $SU(1,1|2)$, all $WA$ gravities and the $N=2$ $W_n$ models are treated in some detail. "
"We perform the complete bosonization of 2+1 dimensional QED with one fermionic flavor in the Hamiltonian formalism. The fermion operators are explicitly constructed in terms of the vector potential and the electric field. We carefully specify the regularization procedure involved in the definition of these operators, and calculate the fermionic bilinears and the energy - momentum tensor. The algebra of bilinears exhibits the Schwinger terms which also appear in perturbation theory. The bosonic Hamiltonian density is a local polynomial function of $A_i$ and $E_i$, and we check explicitly the Lorentz invariance of the resulting bosonic theory. Our construction is conceptually very similar to Mandelstam's construction in 1+1 dimensions, and is dissimilar from the recent bosonization attempts in 2+1 dimensions which hinge crucially on the existence of a Chern - Simons term.

"Review of results from lattice QCD of relevance to standard-model phenomenology, to appear in Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science. KEY WORDS: hadron masses, quark mixing (CKM) matrix, weak matrix elements, strong coupling constant. "
We discuss a possible exact equivalence of the Abelian Higgs model and a scalar theory of a magnetic vortex field in 2+1 dimensions. The vortex model has a current - current interaction and can be viewed as a strong coupling limit of a massive vector theory. The fixed point structure of the theory is discussed and mapped into fixed points of the Higgs model. 
"We describe a static solution for $d = 2$ critical string theory including the tachyon $T$ but with its potential $V (T)$ set to zero. This solution thus incorporates tachyon back reaction and, when $T = 0$, reduces to the black hole solution. When $T \neq 0$ we find that (1) the Schwarzschild horizon of the above black hole splits into two, resembling Reissner-Nordstrom horizons and (2) the curvature scalar develops new singularities at the horizons. We show that these features will persist even when $V (T)$ is nonzero. We present a time dependent extension of our static solution and discuss some possible methods for removing the above singularities. "
"The equilibrium statistical mechanics of a d dimensional ``oriented'' manifold in an N+d dimensional random medium are analyzed in d=4-epsilon dimensions. For N=1, this problem describes an interface pinned by impurities. For d=1, the model becomes identical to the directed polymer in a random medium. Here, we generalize the functional renormalization group method used previously to study the interface problem, and extract the behavior in the double limit epsilon small and N large, finding non-analytic corrections in 1/N. For short-range disorder, the interface width scales as a power law of the width. We calculate the roughness exponent characterizing this power law for small epsilon and large N, as well as other properties of the phase. We also analyze the behavior for disorder with long-range correlations, as is appropriate for interfaces in random field systems, and study the crossover between the two regimes. "
"In isotropic systems below the transition temperature, the massless Goldstone modes imply critical infrared singularities in the statics and dynamics along the entire coexistence curve. We examine the important question whether these coexistence anomalies are of relevance also in more realistic systems displaying anisotropies. By applying a generalized renormalization scheme to the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau models, we treat two quite different but characteristic cases, namely the influence of (i) weak cubic anisotropies, and (ii) long-range dipolar interactions. In the presence of cubic terms, the transverse excitations acquire a mass and thus one expects the theory to approach an uncritical ""Gaussian"" regime in the limit ${\vec q} \rightarrow 0$ and $\omega \rightarrow 0$. Therefore, we first consider the one-component case in order to show that our formalism also provides a consistent description of the crossover into an asymptotically Gaussian theory. In the case of (weak) cubic anisotropies, the fact that for $n < 4$ the fluctuations tend to restore the $O(n)$-symmetry at the critical point proves to be most important, since under these circumstances coexistence-type singularities may be found in an intermediate wavenumber and frequency range. The dipolar interaction induces an anisotropy in momentum space, which does not completely destroy the massless character of the transverse fluctuations, but only effectively reduces the number of Goldstone modes by one. Remarkably, similar to the isotropic case the asymptotic theory can be treated exactly. For $n \geq 3$ we find coexistence anomalies governed by the isotropic power laws. However, the amplitudes of the respective scaling functions depend on the angle between order parameter and external wavevector. "
"Hysteresis is observed at second order phase transitions. Universal scaling formul\ae{} for the areas of hysteresis loops are written down. Critical exponents are defined, and related to other exponents for static and dynamic critical phenomena. These relations are verified with Langevin dynamics in both the critical and tricritical mean-field models. A finite-size scaling relation is tested in the two-dimensional Ising model with heat-bath dynamics. (Shar file; 2 figures created through dvips directives from 4 PS files included) "
A direct derivation of the string field theory action in the Witten's background independent open string theory for the case when ghosts and matter are decoupled is given and consequences are discussed. 
"I show that the strong coupling solution of the Kazakov--Migdal model with a general interaction potential $V(\Phi)$ in $D$ dimensions coincides at large $N$ with that of the hermitean one-matrix model with the potential $\tilde{V}(\Phi)$: $$ (2D-1)\tilde{V}'= (D-1)V'+ D\sqrt{(V')^2+4(1-2D)\Phi^2}, $$ whose solution is known. The proof is given for an even potential $V(\Phi)=V(-\Phi)$ by solving loop equations. "
"Deep inelastic structure functions $F_2^A(x)$ are investigated in a $Q^2$ rescaling model with parton recombination effects. We find that the model can explain experimentally measured $F_2^A(x)$ structure functions reasonably well in the wide Bjorken$-x$ range ($0.005<x<0.8$). In the very small $x$ region ($x<0.02$), recombination results are very sensitive to input sea-quark and gluon distributions. "
"Brownian motion may be embedded in the Fock space of bosonic free field in one dimension.Extending this correspondence to a family of creation and annihilation operators satisfying a q-deformed algebra, the notion of q-deformation is carried from the algebra to the domain of stochastic processes.The properties of q-deformed Brownian motion, in particular its non-Gaussian nature and cumulant structure,are established. "
"The phase transition of the three--dimensional random field Ising model with a discrete ($\pm h$) field distribution is investigated by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Values of the critical exponents for the correlation length, specific heat, susceptibility, disconnected susceptibility and magnetization are determined simultaneously via finite size scaling. While the exponents for the magnetization and disconnected susceptibility are consistent with a first order transition, the specific heat appears to saturate indicating no latent heat. Sample to sample fluctuations of the susceptibilty are consistent with the droplet picture for the transition. "
"We develop a theory to account for the cosmic ray spectrum between 1 GeV and 10^4 GeV following the earlier papers of this series. We use the basic concept that the cosmic ray particles are accelerated in a supernova shock that travels through the interstellar medium. Physically important ingredients besides the presence of a strong shock are diffusion, drifts, convection, adiabatic cooling, the injection history, and the topology of the magnetic field, here assumed for simplicity to be homogeneous in the interstellar medium. The result is a spectrum, which for strong shocks in a gas with adiabatic index 5/3 yields a spectrum of E^-2.42. Interstellar turbulence with a Kolmogorov spectrum then leads by leakage from the galactic disk to a spectrum which is E^-2.75, as observed. We argue that the ratio of cosmic ray electrons to protons is determined by the amount of expansion which takes place from the cessation of electron injection to the break-up of the shell by cooling instabilities. Since the highest particle energy reached derives from geometrical arguments, it depends on the charge of the nucleus and so higher Z elements are predicted to reach higher energies. "
"We formulate a conjecture, stating that the algebra of $n$ pairs of deformed Bose creation and annihilation operators is a factor-algebra of $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$, considered as a Hopf algebra, and prove it for $n=2$ case. To this end we show that for any value of $q$ $U_q[osp(1/4)]$ can be viewed as a superalgebra, freely generated by two pairs $B_1^\pm$, $B_2^\pm$ of deformed para-Bose operators. We write down all Hopf algebra relations, an analogue of the Cartan-Weyl basis, the ""commutation"" relations between the generators and a basis in $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$ entirely in terms of $B_1^\pm$, $B_2^\pm$. "
We calculate in next-to-leading order inclusive cross sections of single-particle production via resolved photons in $ep$ collisions at HERA. Transverse-momentum and rapidity distributions are presented and the scale dependence is studied. The results are compared with first experimental data from the H1 Collaboration at HERA. 
Long-wavelength gravitational waves can induce significant temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background. Distinguishing this from anisotropy induced by energy density fluctuations is critical for testing inflationary cosmology and theories of large-scale structure formation. We describe full radiative transport calculations of the two contributions and show that they differ dramatically at angular scales below a few degrees. We show how anisotropy experiments probing large- and small-angular scales can combine to distinguish the imprint due to gravitational waves. 
We point out an incompleteness of formulations of gravitational and gauge theories that use traces of holonomies around closed curves as their basic variables. It is shown that in general such loop variables have to satisfy certain inequalities if they are to give a description equivalent to the usual one in terms of local gauge potentials. 
"We discuss systematically the fermion mass and mixing matrices in a generic \linebreak field-theoretical flipped $SU(5)$ model, with particular applications to neutrino and baryon number-changing physics. We demonstrate that the different quark flavour branching ratios in proton decay are related to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa angles, whereas the lepton flavour branching ratios are undetermined. The light neutrino mixing angles observable via oscillation effects are related to the heavy conjugate (right-handed) neutrino mass matrix, which also plays a key role in cosmological baryogenesis. The ratios of neutrino and charged lepton decay modes in baryon decay may also be related to neutrino oscillation parameters. Plausible Ans\""atze for the generation structure of coupling matrices motivate additional relations between physical observables, and yield a satisfactory baryon asymmetry. "
"We show how to expand the free energy of a matrix model coupled to arbitrary matter in powers of the matter coupling constant. Concentrating on $\nu$ uncoupled Ising models---which have central charge $\nu/2$---we work out the expansion to sixth order for $\nu$ = 1, 2, and 3. Analyzing the series by the ratio method, we exhibit the spin-ordering phase transition. We discuss the limit $\nu \rightarrow \infty$, which is especially clear in the low temperature expansion; we prove that in this limit the dependence of the model on $\nu$ becomes trivial. "
"Though screened at large distances, a point-like electric charge can still participate in a long-range electromagnetic interaction in the Higgs phase, namely that with the Aharonov-Bohm field produced by a localized magnetic flux. We show that this follows from the fact that the screening charge, induced in the presence of a Higgs condensate, does not interact with the Aharonov-Bohm field. The same phenomenon occurs, if a Chern-Simons term is incorporated in the action. This observation provides a physical basis for the recently proposed classification of the superselection sectors of this model in terms of a quasi-Hopf algebra. "
"We prove a Wiener energy estimate for relaxed Dirichlet problems $Lu + \mu u =\nu$ in $\Omega$, with $L$ an uniformly elliptic operator with bounded coefficients, $\mu$ a measure of ${\cal M}_0(\Omega)$, $\nu$ a Kato measure and $\Omega$ a bounded open set of ${\bf R}^N$, $N \geq 2$. Choosing a particular $\mu$, we obtain an energy estimate also for classical variational Dirichlet problems. "
"The low temperature dynamics of the three dimensional Ising spin glass in zero field with a discrete bond distribution is investigated via MC simulations. The thermoremanent magnetization is found to decay algebraically and the temperature dependent exponents agree very well with the experimentally determined values. The nonequilibrium autocorrelation function $C(t,t_w)$ shows a crossover at the waiting (or {\em aging}) time $t_w$ from algebraic {\em quasi-equilibrium} decay for times $t$$\ll$$t_w$ to another, faster algebraic decay for $t$$\gg$$t_w$ with an exponent similar to one for the remanent magnetization. "
Some aspects of finite quantum field theories in 3+1 dimensions are discussed. A model with non--supersymmetric particle content and vanishing one-- and two--loop beta functions for the gauge coupling and one--loop beta functions for Yukawa--couplings is presented. 
"We present two arguments indicating that the large value for the $\epsilon_1$ mixing parameter at 50 MeV, which the Basel group extracted from their recent $A_{zz}$ measurement, may be incorrect. First, there are nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials which predict the $\epsilon_1$ at 50 MeV substantially below the Basel value and reproduce the Basel $A_{zz}$ data accurately. Second, the large value for $\epsilon_1$ at 50 MeV proposed by the Basel group can only be explained by a model for the NN interaction which is very unrealistic (no $\rho$-meson and essentially a point-like $\pi NN$ vertex) and overpredicts the $\epsilon_1$ in the energy range where it is well determined (150--500 MeV) by a factor of two. "
We use the quantum Brownian model to derive the uncertainty relation for a quantum open system. We examine how the fluctuations of a quantum system evolve after it is brought in contact with a heat bath at finite temperature. We study the decoherence and relaxation processes and use this example to examine 1) the relation between quantum and thermal fluctuations; and 2) the conditions when the two basic postulates of quantum statistical mechanics become valid. 
"The purpose of this review is to describe in some detail the mathematical relationship between geometrodynamics and connection dynamics in the context of the classical theories of 2+1 and 3+1 gravity. I analyze the standard Einstein-Hilbert theory (in any spacetime dimension), the Palatini and Chern-Simons theories in 2+1 dimensions, and the Palatini and self-dual theories in 3+1 dimensions. I also couple various matter fields to these theories and briefly describe a pure spin-connection formulation of 3+1 gravity. I derive the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion from an action principle and perform a Legendre transform to obtain a Hamiltonian formulation of each theory. Since constraints are present in all these theories, I construct constraint functions and analyze their Poisson bracket algebra. I demonstrate, whenever possible, equivalences between the theories. "
"We show how Gromov's spaces of bounded geometries provide a general mathematical framework for addressing and solving many of the issues of $3D$-simplicial quantum gravity. In particular, we establish entropy estimates characterizing the asymptotic distribution of combinatorially inequivalent triangulated $3$-manifolds, as the number of tetrahedra diverges. Moreover, we offer a rather detailed presentation of how spaces of three-dimensional riemannian manifolds with natural bounds on curvatures, diameter, and volume can be used to prove that three-dimensional simplicial quantum gravity is connected to a Gaussian model determined by the simple homotopy types of the underlying manifolds. This connection is determined by a Gaussian measure defined over the general linear group $GL({\bf R},\infty)$. It is shown that the partition function of three-dimensional simplicial quantum gravity is well-defined, in the thermodynamic limit, for a suitable range of values of the gravitational and cosmological coupling constants. Such values are determined by the Reidemeister-Franz torsion invariants associated with an orthogonal representation of the fundamental groups of the set of manifolds considered. The geometrical system considered shows also critical behavior, and in such a case the partition function is exactly evaluated and shown to be equal to the Reidemeister-Franz torsion. The phase structure in the thermodynamical limit is also discussed. In particular, there are either phase transitions describing the passage from a simple homotopy type to another, and (first order) phase transitions within a given simple homotopy type which seem to confirm, on an analytical ground, the picture suggested by numerical simulations. "
"We investigate the fractal structure of $2d$ quantum gravity, both for pure gravity and for gravity coupled to multiple gaussian fields and for gravity coupled to Ising spins. The roughness of the surfaces is described in terms of baby universes and using numerical simulations we measure their distribution which is related to the string susceptibility exponent $\g_{string}$. "
"The low temperature dynamics of the three dimensional Ising spin glass in zero field with a discrete bond distribution is investigated via MC simulations. The thermoremanent magnetization is found to decay algebraically and the temperature dependent exponents agree very well with the experimentally determined values. The nonequilibrium autocorrelation function $C(t,t_w)$ shows a crossover at the waiting (or {\em aging}) time $t_w$ from algebraic {\em quasi-equilibrium} decay for times $t$$\ll$$t_w$ to another, faster algebraic decay for $t$$\gg$$t_w$ with an exponent similar to one for the remanent magnetization. "
Systematic on-shell renormalization programme is carried out for the Higgs and gauge boson sectors of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Complete 1-loop results for the 2- and 3-point Green's functions are explicitly given. The Higgs boson masses and the cross sections for the neutral scalar production in the $e^+e^-$ colliders are calculated. 
"We explore the nuclear responses at intermediate energies, particularly in the spin longitudinal and spin transverse isovector channels, within the continuum random phase approximation framework. We also employ an extension of the standard random phase approximation to account for the spreading width of the single particle states through the inclusion of a complex and energy-dependent nucleon self-energy. The nuclear responses are then used as the basic ingredient to calculate hadronic reactions in the Glauber theory framework. Here both one and two-step contributions to the multiple scattering series in the quasi-elastic peak region are taken into account. We find evidence for shell effects in the one-step response and a strong dependence on the momentum regime of the two-step contribution. "
"The propagation of scalar and spinor fields in a spacetime whose metric changes signature is analyzed. Recent work of Dray et al. on particle production from signature change for a (massless) scalar field is reviewed, and an attempt is made to extend their analysis to the case of a (massless) spin-half field. In contrast to their results for a scalar field, it is shown here---for $SL(2,C)$ spinors---that although there are inequivalent forms of the Dirac equation that can be used to propagate a spinor in a signature changing spacetime, none of these forms gives rise to a conserved inner product on the space of solutions to the field equations.

"An illustrative analysis is presented to show the origin of the energy-independent maximal asymmetry observed for wide ranges of angles in the reactions $\pbarppipi$ and $\pbarpKK$. % The general nature of our simple relation between helicity -flip and -nonflip partial wave amplitudes enforces the notion that % these features of the asymmetry for these two annihilation reactions are likely to persist within the hadronic regime. % At higher energies these features of the asymmetry will probably be modified significantly, signaling the onset of perturbative QCD. % Our study supports the arguments that the final $\KbarK$ state originates from a more central reaction than the $\pipi$ final state.

The spectrum of a one-dimensional chain of $SU(n)$ spins positioned at the static equilibrium positions of the particles in a corresponding classical Calogero system with an exchange interaction inversely proportional to the square of their distance is studied. As in the translationally invariant Haldane--Shastry model the spectrum is found to exhibit a very simple structure containing highly degenerate ``super-multiplets''. The algebra underlying this structure is identified and several sets of raising and lowering operators are given explicitely. On the basis of this algebra and numerical studies we give the complete spectrum and thermodynamics of the $SU(2)$ system. 
"A dynamically preferred quasi-local definition of gravitational energy is given in terms of the Hamiltonian of a `2+2' formulation of general relativity. The energy is well-defined for any compact orientable spatial 2-surface, and depends on the fundamental forms only. The energy is zero for any surface in flat spacetime, and reduces to the Hawking mass in the absence of shear and twist. For asymptotically flat spacetimes, the energy tends to the Bondi mass at null infinity and the \ADM mass at spatial infinity, taking the limit along a foliation parametrised by area radius. The energy is calculated for the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\""om and Robertson-Walker solutions, and for plane waves and colliding plane waves. Energy inequalities are discussed, and for static black holes the irreducible mass is obtained on the horizon. Criteria for an adequate definition of quasi-local energy are discussed. "
"We report experimental observations of traveling waves in a pure fluid with a free surface situated in a long container submitted to a horizontal temperature gradient perpendicular to its large extension. Above a critical value of the gradient and depending on the height of liquid $ h, $ a source of waves is created in the container for small value of $ h, $ while the system exhibits stationary patterns for larger values of $ h. $ The spatio-temporal properties of the waves are studied and compared to theoretical predictions.

"We discuss two different approximation schemes for the self-consistent solution of the {\it relativistic} Brueckner-Hartree-Fock equation for finite nuclei. In the first scheme, the Dirac effects are deduced from corresponding nuclear matter calculations, whereas in the second approach the local-density approximation is used to account for the effects of correlations. The results obtained by the two methods are very similar. Employing a realistic one-boson-exchange potential (Bonn~A), the predictions for energies and radii of $^{16}$O and $^{40}$Ca come out in substantially better agreement with experiment as compared to non-relativistic approaches. As a by-product of our study, it turns out that the Fock exchange-terms, ignored in a previous investigation, are not negligible. "
"Arguments are presented for the expected behaviour of $\piNpiN$ scattering and the $\pbarppipi$ reaction at high energy and large scattering angles. % The annihilation reaction has close to maximal asymmetry ($\approx$ 1) for $p_{lab} \siml $ 2.2 GeV/c. % As will be presented for fixed (90$\degree$) angle this large asymmetry will not become zero but will start to oscillate with energy at higher energies and large $Q^2$ when perturbative QCD becomes applicable. This is due to the energy dependence of a QCD phase difference between the independent quark-quark scattering (Landshoff) and short-distance processes at high but not asymptotic energies. % A consequence of the existence the Landshoff process is that even if helicity is conserved at the quark level ($m_{q}$ = 0 MeV), helicity does not have to be conserved on the hadronic level. % We will discuss the implications for spin observables in $pp$ elastic scattering and argue that "
"Given an elliptic operator~$L$ on a bounded domain~$\Omega \subseteq {\bf R}^n$, and a positive Radon measure~$\mu$ on~$\Omega$, not charging polar sets, we discuss an explicit approximation procedure which leads to a sequence of domains~$\Omega_h \subseteq \Omega$ with the following property: for every~$f\in H^{-1}(\Omega)$ the sequence~$u_h$ of the solutions of the Dirichlet problems~$L\, u_h=f$ in~$\Omega_h$, $u_h=0$ on~$\partial \Omega_h$, extended to 0 in~$\Omega \setminus \Omega_h$, converges to the solution of the \lq\lq relaxed Dirichlet problem\rq\rq\ $L\,u+\mu u=f$ in~$\Omega$, $u=0$ on~$\partial \Omega$.

"The method of Hawking to obtain black hole evaporation through Bogoljubov transformation between asymptotic modes (in and out) is generalized. The construction is local in that the in modes (of say positive frequency) are decomposed by Bogoljubov transformation into positive and negative frequency local inertial modes (i.e. those which are solutions of the d'Alembertian in terms of the local normal coordinates). From this follows an interesting reexpression of the local energy momentum tensor, more particularly of the outgoing energy flux. One finds that even in the local description there exists a partial thermal character parametrized by a local temperature. There exists quantum interference effects as well. These become negligible at large distance from the black hole. "

"We introduce the notion of a braided Lie algebra consisting of a finite-dimensional vector space $\CL$ equipped with a bracket $[\ ,\ ]:\CL\tens\CL\to \CL$ and a Yang-Baxter operator $\Psi:\CL\tens\CL\to \CL\tens\CL$ obeying some axioms. We show that such an object has an enveloping braided-bialgebra $U(\CL)$. We show that every generic $R$-matrix leads to such a braided Lie algebra with $[\ ,\ ]$ given by structure constants $c^{IJ}{}_K$ determined from $R$. In this case $U(\CL)=B(R)$ the braided matrices introduced previously. We also introduce the basic theory of these braided Lie algebras, including the natural right-regular action of a braided-Lie algebra $\CL$ by braided vector fields, the braided-Killing form and the quadratic Casimir associated to $\CL$. These constructions recover the relevant notions for usual, colour and super-Lie algebras as special cases. In addition, the standard quantum deformations $U_q(g)$ are understood as the enveloping algebras of such underlying braided Lie algebras with $[\ ,\ ]$ on $\CL\subset U_q(g)$ given by the quantum adjoint action.

"Classical Bianchi-Lie, Backlund and Darboux transformations are considered. Their generalizations for the dynamical systems are discussed. For the transformation being the generalization of the normal shift the special class of dynamical systems is defined. The effective criterion for separating such systems in form of partial differential equations is found. "
Pseudo-Goldstone bosons couple with photons through a P and T violating interaction of the form ${\cal {L_I}}=g_{a\gamma \gamma}~ a F\tilde F$. Strong magnetic fields in rotating compact stars induce a non-zero ${\vec E}\cdot{\vec B}$ outside the stellar surface which acts as a source for the pseudo-scalar field. Pulsar signals propagating through this pseudo-scalar `hair' suffer a differential time lag between the left and the right circularly polarised modes because of the P and T violating pseudoscalar boson-photon interaction. Determination of this time lag upto a microsecond accuracy can lead to a measurment of (or rule out) pseudo-Goldstone boson-photon coupling upto $g_{a \gamma \gamma}\leq 4.6 \times 10^{-9}~GeV^{-1}$.

"We consider two dimensional QCD with the spatial dimension compactified to a circle. We show that the states in the theory consist of interacting strings that wind around the circle and derive the Hamiltonian for this theory in the large $N$ limit, complete with interactions. Mapping the winding states into momentum states, we express this Hamiltonian in terms of a continuous field. For a $U(N)$ gauge group with a background source of Wilson loops, we recover the collective field Hamiltonian found by Das and Jevicki for the $c=1$ matrix model, except the spatial coordinate is on a circle. We then proceed to show that two dimensional QCD with a $U(N)$ gauge group can be reduced to a one- dimensional unitary matrix model and is hence equivalent to a theory of $N$ free nonrelativistic fermions on a circle. A similar result is true for the group $SU(N)$, but the fermions must be modded out by the center of mass coordinate. "

"Two-dimensional quantum gravity is identified as a second-class system which we convert into a first-class system via the Batalin-Fradkin (BF) procedure. Using the extended phase space method, we then formulate the theory in most general class of gauges. The conformal gauge action suggested by David, Distler and Kawai is derived from a first principle. We find a local, light-cone gauge action whose Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin invariance implies Polyakov's curvature equation $\partial_{-}R=\partial_{-}^{3}g_{++}=0$, revealing the origin of the $SL(2,R)$ Kac-Moody symmetry. The BF degree of freedom turns out be dynamically active as the Liouville mode in the conformal gauge, while in the light-cone gauge the conformal degree of freedom plays that r{\^o}le. The inclusion of the cosmological constant term in both gauges and the harmonic gauge-fixing are also considered. "
"Over a smooth complex projective curve $C$ of genus $g$ let $\M (n,d)$ be the moduli space of semistable bundles of rank $n$ and degree $d$ on $C$, and $\SM (n,L)$, the moduli space of those bundles whose determinant is isomorphic to a fixed line bundle $L$ over $C$. Let $\theta_F$ and $\theta$ be theta bundles over these two moduli spaces. We prove a simple formula relating their spaces of sections: if $h=\gcd (n,d)$ is the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $d$, and $L\in \Pic ^d(C)$, then $$\dim H^0(\SM (n,L), \theta^k) \cdot k^g=\dim H^0(\M(n,d),\theta_F^k)\cdot h^g.$$ We also formulate a conjectural duality between these two types of spaces of sections.

We define the Seshadri constant of a space curve and consider ways to estimate it. We then show that it governs the gonality of the curve. We use an argument based on Bogomolov's instability theorem on a threefold. The same methods are then applied to the study of the behaviour of a stable vector bundle on P^3 under restriction to curves and surfaces. 
"Let X be a smooth projective variety defined over an algebraically closed field, and let Y in X be a reduced and irreducible ample divisor in X. We give a numerical sufficient condition for a base point free pencil on $Y$ to be the restriction of a base point free pencil on $X$. This result is then extended to families of pencils and to morphisms to arbitrary smooth curves. Serrano had already studied this problem in the case n=2 and 3, and Reider had then attacked it in the case $n=2$ using vector bundle methods based on Bogomolov's instability theorem on a surface (char(k)=0). The argument given here is based on Bogomolov's theorem on an n-dimensional variety, and on its recent adaptations to the setting of prime charachterstic (due to Shepherd-Barron and Moriwaki). "
The structure of ground states of generic FQH states on a torus is studied by using both effective theory and electron wave function. The relation between the effective theory and the wave function becomes transparent when one considers the ground state structure. We find that the non-abelian Berry's phases of the abelian Hall states generated by twisting the mass matrix are identical to the modular transformation matrix for the characters of a Gaussian conformal field theory. We also show that the Haldane-Rezayi spin singlet state has a ten fold degeneracy on a torus which indicates such a state is a non-abelian Hall state. 
"It is shown that ""nonintegrable phases of Wilson line integrals"" are not true dynamical variables in Chern-Simons field theory. "
"The condition onto pair ($F,G$) of function Banach spaces under which there exists a integral operator $T:F\to G$ with analytic kernel such that the inverse mapping $T^{-1}:$im$T\to F$ does not belong to arbitrary a priori given Borel (or Baire) class is found. "
"A general formula is obtained for Yukawa couplings in compactification on \LGO{s} and corresponding \CY\ spaces. Up to the kinetic term normalizations, this equates the classical Koszul ring structure with the \LGO\ chiral ring structure and the true super\CFT\ ring structure. "
"Curve of growth analysis, applied to the Lyman series absorption ratios deduced in our previous paper, yields a measurement of the logarithmic slope of distribution of \Lya\ clouds in column density $N$. The observed exponential distribution of the clouds' equivalent widths $W$ is then shown to require a broad distribution of velocity parameters $b$, extending up to 80 km s$^{-1}$. We show how the exponential itself emerges in a natural way. An absolute normalization for the differential distribution of cloud numbers in $z$, $N$, and $b$ is obtained. By detailed analysis of absorption fluctuations along the line of sight we are able to put upper limits on the cloud-cloud correlation function $\xi$ on several megaparsec length scales. We show that observed $b$ values, if thermal, are incompatible, in several different ways, with the hypothesis of equilibrium heating and ionization by a background UV flux. Either a significant component of $b$ is due to bulk motion (which we argue against on several grounds), or else the clouds are out of equilibrium, and hotter than is implied by their ionization state, a situation which could be indicative of recent adiabatic collapse.

"We study the two-matrix model which represents the sum over closed and open random surfaces coupled to an Ising Model. The boundary conditions are characterized by the fact that the Ising spins sitting at the vertices of the boundaries are all in the same state. We obtain the string equation and discuss the results. (No change in physics, only some misprints are corrected) "
Conformal field theories with correlation functions which have logarithmic singularities are considered. It is shown that those singularities imply the existence of additional operators in the theory which together with ordinary primary operators form the basis of the Jordan cell for the operator $L_{0}$. An example of the field theory possessing such correlation functions is given. 
"We present some explicit results on the structure of singular vectors in $c=2$ Verma modules of the $\cW_3$ algebra. Using the embedding patterns of those vectors we construct resolutions for the $c=2$ irreducible modules, and thus are able to compute some of the BRST cohomology of $\cW_3$ gravity coupled to $c=2$ matter. In particular, we determine the states in the ground ring of the theory. (To appear in the proceedings of the AMS Special Session on ""Geometry and Physics"", USC, Los Angeles, November 5-6, 1992) "
The main result: the dual of separable Banach space $X$ contains a total subspace which is not norming over any infinite dimensional subspace of $X$ if and only if $X$ has a nonquasireflexive quotient space with the strictly singular quotient mapping. 
"The change of signature of a metric is explained using simple examples and methods. The Klein-Gordon field on a signature-changing background is discussed, and it is shown how the approach of Dray et al.\ can be corrected to ensure that the Klein-Gordon equation holds. Isotropic cosmologies are discussed, and it is shown how the approach of Ellis et al.\ can be corrected to ensure that the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations hold. A straightforward calculation shows that a well defined Ricci tensor requires the standard junction condition, namely vanishing of the second fundamental form of the junction surface. "
"An approach is presented which allows a self-consistent description of the fragmentation of single-particle strength for nucleons in finite nuclei employing the Greens function formalism. The self-energy to be considered in the Dyson equation for the single-particle Greens function contains all terms of first (Hartree-Fock) and second order in the residual interaction. It is demonstrated that the fragmentation of the single-particle strength originating from the terms of second order can efficiently be described in terms of the so-called BAGEL approximation. Employing this approximation the self-energy can be evaluated in a self-consistent way, i.e. the correlations contained in the Greens function are taken into account for the evaluation of the self-energy. As an example this scheme is applied to the nucleus $^{16}O$, using a realistic nucleon nucleon interaction. The effects of the correlations on the occupation probabilities and the binding energy are evaluated. "
"Techniques for the statistical analysis of the \Lya\ forest in high redshift quasars are developed, and applied to the low resolution (25 \AA) spectra of 29 of the 33 quasars in the Schneider-Schmidt-Gunn (SSG) sample.We find that the mean absorption increases with $z$ approximately as a power law $(1+z)^{\gamma+1}$ with $\gamma = 2.46\pm 0.37$. The mean ratio of \Lya\ to Lyman $\beta$ absorption in the clouds is $0.476\pm 0.054$. We also detect, and obtain ratios, for Lyman $\beta$, $\gamma$, and possibly $\epsilon$. We are also able to quantify the fluctuations of the absorption around its mean, and find that these are comparable to, or perhaps slightly larger than, that expected from an uncorrelated distribution of clouds. The techniques in this paper, which include the use of bootstrap resampling of the quasar sample to obtain estimated errors and error covariances, and a mathematical treatment of absorption from a (possibly non-uniform) stochastic distribution of lines, should be applicable to future, more extensive, data sets. "
It is shown that the nuclear binding correction in deep inelastic lepton scattering is essentially the same in light front and instant form representations. Some contradicting papers are discussed. 
We propose a new formulation of the D=11 supermembrane theory that involves commuting spinors (twistor--like variables) and exhibits a manifest $n$--extended world volume supersymmetry $(1\leq n\leq 8)$. This supersymmetry replaces $n$ components of the usual $\kappa$--symmetry. We show that this formulation is classically equivalent to the standard one. 
"Meghnad Saha occupies a special role in the history of Indian science, having been a pioneer in its organization already from the oppressive colonial period and having left important legacies to post-colonial India like the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics. He is famous for his research in astrophysics, and has also made important, but less well-known contributions to magnetic monopole theory. This article attempts an elementary survey of this theory and its implications with special emphasis on Saha's work and argues that the latter has had wide ranging consequences for fundamental physics.

"We verify that the fractional KdV equation is a bi-hamiltonian system using the zero curvature equation in $SL(3)$ matrix valued Lax pair representation, and explicitly find the closed form for the hamiltonian operators of the system. The second hamiltonian operator is the classical version of the $W^{(2)}_3$ algebra. We also construct systematically the Miura map of $W^{(2)}_3$ algebra using a gauge transformation of the $SL(3)$ matrix valued Lax operator in a particular gauge, and construct the modified fractional KdV equaiotn as hamiltonian system.

N=2 supersymmetric WZNW models associated with finite-dimensional Manin triples is considered. Physical states in topological phase of these models are computed and them N=2 WZNW representatives are constracted. Ring structure of the physical states is computed. 
If a separable Banach space $X$ is such that for some nonquasireflexive Banach space $Y$ there exists a surjective strictly singular operator $T:X\to Y$ then for every countable ordinal $\alpha $ the dual of $X$ contains a subspace whose weak$^*$ sequential closures of orders less than $\alpha $ are not norming over any infinite-dimensional subspace of $X$ and whose weak$^*$ sequential closure of order $\alpha +1$ coincides with $X^*$ 
"The supersymmetric product of a supercurve is constructed with the aid of a theorem of algebraic invariants and the notion of positive relative superdivisor (supervortex) is introduced. A supercurve of positive superdivisors of degree 1 (supervortices of vortex number 1) of the original supercurve is constructed as its supercurve of conjugate fermions, as well as the supervariety of relative positive superdivisors of degre p (supervortices of vortex number p.) A universal superdivisor is defined and it is proved that every positive relative superdivisor can be obtained in a unique way as a pull-back of the universal superdivisor. The case of SUSY-curves is discussed. "
"Evolution of inhomogeneities in the axion field around the QCD epoch is studied numerically, including for the first time important non-linear effects. It is found that perturbations on scales corresponding to causally disconnected regions at $T \sim 1 \, {\rm GeV}$ can lead to very dense axion clumps, with present density $\rho_a \ga 10^{-8}\,{\rm g \, cm^{-3}}$. This is high enough for the collisional $2a \rightarrow 2a$ process to lead to Bose--Einstein relaxation in the gravitationally bound clumps of axions, forming Bose stars. "
For a Banach space $X$ we shall denote the set of all closed subspaces of $X$ by $G(X)$. In some kinds of problems it turned out to be useful to endow $G(X)$ with a topology. The main purpose of the present paper is to survey results on two the most common topologies on $G(X)$. 
It is an English translation of the paper originally published in Russian and Ukrainian in 1987. In the appendix of his book S.Banach introduced the following definition Let $X$ be a Banach space and $\Gamma$ be a subspace of the dual space $X^*$. The set of all limits of $w^{*}$-convergent sequences in $\Gamma $ is called the $w^*${\it -derived set} of $\Gamma $ and is denoted by $\Gamma _{(1)}$. For an ordinal $\alpha$ the $w^{*}$-{\it derived set of order} $\alpha $ is defined inductively by the equality: $$ \Gamma _{(\alpha )}=\bigcup _{\beta <\alpha }((\Gamma _{(\beta )})_{(1)}. $$ 
"We present an analysis of the octet baryon masses and the $\pi N$ and $KN$ $\sigma$--terms in the framework of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. At next-to-leading order, ${\cal O}(q^3)$, knowledge of the baryon masses and $\sigma_{\pi N}(0)$ allows to determine the three corresponding finite low--energy constants and to predict the the two $KN$ $\sigma$--terms $\sigma^{(1,2)}_{KN} (0)$. We also include the spin-3/2 decuplet in the effective theory. The presence of the non--vanishing energy scale due to the octet--decuplet splitting shifts the average octet baryon mass by an infinite amount and leads to infinite renormalizations of the low--energy constants. The first observable effect of the decuplet intermediate states to the baryon masses starts out at order $q^4$. We argue that it is not sufficient to retain only these but no other higher order terms to achieve a consistent description of the three--flavor scalar sector of baryon CHPT. In addition, we critically discuss an SU(2) result which allows to explain the large shift of $\sigma_{\pi N}(2M_\pi^2) - \sigma_{\pi N}(0)$ via intermediate $\Delta (1232)$ states. "
"The picture of S-wave scatering from a 4D extremal dilatonic black hole is examined. Classically, a small matter shock wave will form a non-extremal black hole. In the ""throat region"" the r-t geometry is exactly that of a collapsing 2D black hole. The 4D Hawking radiation (in this classical background) gives the 2D Hawking radiation exactly in the throat region. Inclusion of the back-reaction changes this picture: the 4D solution can then be matched to the 2D one only if the Hawking radiation is very small and only at the beginning of the radiation. We give that 4D solution. When the total radiating energy approaches the energy carried by the shock wave, the 4D picture breaks down. This happens even before an apparent horizon is formed, which suggests that the 4D semi-classical solution is quite different from the 2D one. "
"After an introduction to the Higgs sector of supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model, recent results on radiative corrections to Higgs boson masses and couplings are reviewed. The phenomenology of supersymmetric Higgs searches at large hadron colliders and at a possible linear $\epem$ collider is also described. (Invited talk at the Workshop `Ten years of SUSY confronting experiment', CERN, 7--9 September 1992, to appear in the Proceedings) "
"The Global Color-symmetry Model of QCD is extended to deal with a background electromagnetic field and the associated conserved current is identified for composite $\bar{q}q$ pion modes of the model. Although the analysis is limited to tree level in the bilocal fields that bosonize the model, the identified photon-pion vertex produces the charge form factor associated with ladder Bethe-Salpeter pion amplitudes. A Ward-Takahashi identity for this vertex is derived in terms of the effective inverse propagator for the equivalent local pion field and the intrinsic ladder Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes. This identity is then used to illustrate gauge invariance by showing that identical vertex information is produced from the gauge change of the free action once proper account is taken of the gauge transformation properties of the bilocal pion fields. Comments are made on the location of the vector dominance mechanism in this treatment. "
"We study the finite-temperature effective potential of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, in the limit of only one light Higgs boson. Because of the large top Yukawa coupling, there can be significant differences with respect to the Standard Model case: for given values of the Higgs and top masses, little supersymmetry breaking in the stop sector can make the phase transition more strongly first-order. After including the full structure of the stop mass matrix, the most important experimental constraints and the leading plasma effects, we find that the present limits on Higgs and squark masses are still compatible with the scenario of electroweak baryogenesis, in a small region of parameter space corresponding to $m_h \simlt 70 \gev$ and $\msba \simlt 105 \gev$. "
"Recently we investigated a new supersymmetrization procedure for the KdV hierarchy inspired in some recent work on supersymmetric matrix models. We extend this procedure here for the generalized KdV hierarchies. The resulting supersymmetric hierarchies are generically nonlocal, except for the case of Boussinesque which we treat in detail. The resulting supersymmetric hierarchy is integrable and bihamiltonian and contains the Boussinesque hierarchy as a subhierarchy. In a particular realization, we extend it by defining supersymmetric odd flows. We end with some comments on a slight modification of this supersymmetrization which yields local equations for any generalized KdV hierarchy. "
"Axion strings and domain walls exhibit a number of novel effects in the presence of gauge fields, in particular the electromagnetic field. It is shown how these effects are reproduced in a model of Nambu-Goto-type strings and open or closed membranes coupled to gauge fields. The generalization to `axionic p-branes' is considered and it is shown how worldvolume gauge fields that arise in certain cases can be interpreted as Goldstone fields. "
"The pinning of flux lattices by weak impurity disorder is studied in the absence of free dislocations using both the gaussian variational method and, to $O(\epsilon=4-d)$, the functional renormalization group. We find universal logarithmic growth of displacements for $2<d<4$: $\overline{\langle u(x)-u(0) \rangle ^2}\sim A_d \log|x|$ and persistence of algebraic quasi-long range translational order. When the two methods can be compared they agree within $10\%$ on the value of $A_d$. We compute the function describing the crossover between the ``random manifold'' regime and the logarithmic regime. This crossover should be observable in present decoration experiments. "
"Exotic smooth manifolds, ${\bf R^2\times_\Theta S^2}$, are constructed and discussed as possible space-time models supporting the usual Kruskal presentation of the vacuum Schwarzschild metric locally, but {\em not globally}. While having the same topology as the standard Kruskal model, none of these manifolds is diffeomorphic to standard Kruskal, although under certain conditions some global smooth Lorentz-signature metric can be continued from the local Kruskal form. Consequently, it can be conjectured that such manifolds represent an infinity of physically inequivalent (non-diffeomorphic) space-time models for black holes. However, at present nothing definitive can be said about the continued satisfaction of the Einstein equations. This problem is also discussed in the original Schwarzschild $(t,r)$ coordinates for which the exotic region is contained in a world tube along the time-axis, so that the manifold is spatially, but not temporally, asymptotically standard. In this form, it is tempting to speculate that the confined exotic region might serve as a source for some exterior solution. Certain aspects of the Cauchy problem are also discussed in terms of ${\bf R^4_\\Theta}$\ models which are ``half-standard'', say for all $t<0,$ but for which $t$ cannot be globally smooth. "
"We consider the processes $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow \ell^{+} \ell^{\prime -}\nu \bar{\nu}^{\prime}$, including all possible charged lepton combinations, with regard to measuring parameters characterizing the $W$ boson. We calculate at what level these processes can be used to measure anamolous triple-boson vertice coupling parameters for the cases of $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders at 500 $GeV$ and 1 $TeV$ center of mass energies. "
"We propose a regular way to construct lattice versions of $W$-algebras, both for quantum and classical cases. In the classical case we write the algebra explicitly and derive the lattice analogue of Boussinesq equation from the Hamiltonian equations of motion. Connection between the lattice Faddeev-Takhtadjan-Volkov algebra [1] and q-deformed Virasoro is also discussed. "
Complete two-loop calculation of a dimensionally regularized Wilson loop with light-like segments is performed in the light-like axial gauge with the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription for the gluon propagator. We find an expression which {\it exactly} coincides with the one previously obtained for the same Wilson loop in covariant Feynman gauge. The renormalization of Wilson loop is performed in the $\MS-$scheme using a general procedure tailored to the light-like axial gauge. We find that the renormalized Wilson loop obeys a renormalization group equation with the same anomalous dimensions as in covariant gauges. Physical implications of our result for investigation of infrared asymptotics of perturbative QCD are pointed out. 
"We apply the Ginzburg criterion to the dimer problem and we solve the apparent contradiction of a system with mean field $\alpha={1\over2}$, the typical value of tricritical systems, and upper critical dimension $D_{cr}=6$. We find that the system has upper critical dimension $D_{cr}=6$ , while for $D\le4$ it should undergo a first order phase transition. We comment on the latter wrong result examining the approximation we used. "
"A very simple minisuperspace describing the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapsing star is found. The semiclasical wave function of that model turn out to describe a bound state. For fixed initial radius of the collapsing star, the corrssponding Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition implies mass quantization. An extension of this model, and some consequences, are considered. "
"Light gluinos have been suggested in order to reconcile $\alpha_s$ determinations from low energy deep inelastic experiments with those inferred from LEP measurements. {}From this hypothesis then one expects, in unified N=1 supergravity models, that also the ""photino"" will be light. We show that this possibility is not in conflict with recent LEP measurements and also that cosmology does not necessarily rule it out in any convincing way. Moreover it leads to $upper$ limits on the masses of the other supersymmetric fermions, for example, the lightest chargino should be lighter than about 75 GeV} "
"We define multi-colour generalizations of braid-monoid algebras and present explicit matrix representations which are related to two-dimensional exactly solvable lattice models of statistical mechanics. In particular, we show that the two-colour braid-monoid algebra describes the Yang-Baxter algebra of the critical dilute A-D-E models which were recently introduced by Warnaar, Nienhuis, and Seaton as well as by Roche. These and other solvable models related to dense and dilute loop models are discussed in detail and it is shown that the solvability is a direct consequence of the algebraic structure. It is conjectured that the Yang-Baxterization of general multi-colour braid-monoid algebras will lead to the construction of further solvable lattice models. "
We investigate the quantum to classical transition of small inhomogeneous fluctuations in the early Universe using the decoherence functional of Gell-Mann and Hartle. We study two types of coarse graining; one due to coarse graining the value of the scalar field and the other due to summing over an environment. We compare the results with a previous study using an environment and the off-diagonal rule proposed by Zurek. We show that the two methods give different results. 
"A laser interferometric detector of gravitational waves is studied and a complete solution (to first order in the metric perturbation) of the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations with appropriate boundary conditions for the light beams is determined. The phase shift, the light deflection and the rotation of the polarization axis induced by gravitational waves are computed. The results are compared with previous literature, and are shown to hold also for detectors which are large in comparison with the gravitational wavelength. "
"We show how to use quantum mechanics on the group manifold U(N) as a tool for problems in U(N) representation theory. The quantum mechanics reduces to free fermions on the circle, which in the large N limit become relativistic. The theory can be bosonized giving the Das-Jevicki-Sakita collective field theory. The formalism is particularly suited to problems involving tensor product multiplicity (Littlewood-Richardson) coefficients. As examples, we discuss the partition function of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on the sphere, and the zero magnetic field limit of D-dimensional Eguchi-Kawai Yang-Mills theory. We give the leading O(N^0) solution of the latter theory, using a method which allows computing corrections. Largely (but not completely) superseded by hep-th/9311130. "
"We analyze to all perturbative orders the properties of two possible quantum extensions of classically on-shell equivalent antisymmetric tensor gauge models in four dimensions. The first case, related to the soft breaking of a topological theory wants a gauge field of canonical dimension one. The other possibility, which assigns canonical dimension two to the gauge field, leads to the $\sigma$ model interpretation of the theory. In both instances we find that the models are anomaly free. "
"The problem of noise-induced escape from a metastable state arises in physics, chemistry, biology, systems engineering, and other areas. The problem is well understood when the underlying dynamics of the system obey detailed balance. When this assumption fails many of the results of classical transition-rate theory no longer apply, and no general method exists for computing the weak-noise asymptotics of fundamental quantities such as the mean escape time. In this paper we present a general technique for analysing the weak-noise limit of a wide range of stochastically perturbed continuous-time nonlinear dynamical systems. We simplify the original problem, which involves solving a partial differential equation, into one in which only ordinary differential equations need be solved. This allows us to resolve some old issues for the case when detailed balance holds. When it does not hold, we show how the formula for the mean escape time asymptotics depends on the dynamics of the system along the most probable escape path. We also present new results on short-time behavior and discuss the possibility of focusing along the escape path. "
"We study the behavior of the self-mass for a quark with a current mass larger than $\Lambda_QCD$, as a function of its Euclidean momentum and mass, in QCD. An expression for the Bethe-Salpeter kernel of the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equation valid in both the infrared and ultraviolet regions is obtained based on a renormalization group analysis. The resulting SD equation is solved numerically. It is found that the quark constituent mass at zero momentum is substantially enhanced due to its effective gauge interaction. The solution in the ultraviolet region agrees well with the known asymptotic solution. The self-mass scales exactly as the on-shell current mass at a fixed momentum. "
"Talk given at the ``4th Hellenic School on Elementary Particle Physics"", Corfu, 2-20 September 1992: The propagation of strings in cosmological space-time backgrounds is reviewed. We show the relation of a special class of cosmological backgrounds to exact conformal field theory. Particular emphasis is put on the singularity structure of the cosmological space-time and on the discrete duality symmetries of the string background. "
"We show that nullification of all tree-order threshold amplitudes involving Higgs particles in the Standard Model occurs, provided that certain equations relating the masses of all existing elementary particles to the mass of the Higgs scalar are satisfied. The possible role of these relations in restoring the high-multiplicity unitarity and their phenomenological relevance are briefly discussed. "
"We generalize and solve the $\roman{mod}\,q$ analogue of a problem of Littlewood and Offord, raised by Vaughan and Wooley, concerning the distribution of the $2^n$ sums of the form $\sum_{i=1}^n\varepsilon_ia_i$, where each $\varepsilon_i$ is $0$ or $1$. For all $q$, $n$, $k$ we determine the maximum, over all reduced residues $a_i$ and all sets $P$ consisting of $k$ arbitrary residues, of the number of these sums that belong to $P$. "
"We present results from an experiment similar to one performed by Packard (1988), in which a genetic algorithm is used to evolve cellular automata (CA) to perform a particular computational task. Packard examined the frequency of evolved CA rules as a function of Langton's lambda parameter (Langton, 1990), and interpreted the results of his experiment as giving evidence for the following two hypotheses: (1) CA rules able to perform complex computations are most likely to be found near ``critical'' lambda values, which have been claimed to correlate with a phase transition between ordered and chaotic behavioral regimes for CA; (2) When CA rules are evolved to perform a complex computation, evolution will tend to select rules with lambda values close to the critical values. Our experiment produced very different results, and we suggest that the interpretation of the original results is not correct. We also review and discuss issues related to lambda, dynamical-behavior classes, and computation in CA. The main constructive results of our study are identifying the emergence and competition of computational strategies and analyzing the central role of symmetries in an evolutionary system. In particular, we demonstrate how symmetry breaking can impede the evolution toward higher computational capability. "
"We extend the formalism whereby boson mappings can be derived from generalized coherent states to boson-fermion mappings for systems with an odd number of fermions. This is accomplished by constructing supercoherent states in terms of both complex and Grassmann variables. In addition to a known mapping for the full so(2$N$+1) algebra, we also uncover some other formal mappings, together with mappings relevant to collective subspaces. "
"The authors mention work of Christensen, Mycielski, Tsujii, and others which is closely related to a survey article by the first author [math.FA/9210220]. "
"This note is a very basic introduction to wavelets. It starts with an orthogonal basis of piecewise constant functions, constructed by dilation and translation. The ``wavelet transform'' maps each $f(x)$ to its coefficients with respect to this basis. The mathematics is simple and the transform is fast (faster than the Fast Fourier Transform, which we briefly explain), but approximation by piecewise constants is poor. To improve this first wavelet, we are led to dilation equations and their unusual solutions. Higher-order wavelets are constructed, and it is surprisingly quick to compute with them --- always indirectly and recursively. We comment informally on the contest between these transforms in signal processing, especially for video and image compression (including high-definition television). So far the Fourier Transform --- or its 8 by 8 windowed version, the Discrete Cosine Transform --- is often chosen. But wavelets are already competitive, and they are ahead for fingerprints. We present a sample of this developing theory. "
We analyze two-dimensional large $N_c$ QCD at finite temperature and show explicitly that the free energy has the correct $N_c$ dependence. 
We present a generalization and refinement of the Sachs-Wolfe technique which unifies many of the approaches taken to date and clarifies both the physical and the mathematical character of the method. We illustrate the formalism with a calculation of the behavior of light passing a moving lens on a Minkowski background. 
"We show that a {\it Borel} action of a Polish group on a standard Borel space is Borel isomorphic to a {\it continuous} action of the group on a Polish space, and we apply this result to three aspects of the theory of Borel actions of Polish groups: universal actions, invariant probability measures, and the Topological Vaught Conjecture. We establish the existence of universal actions for any given Polish group, extending a result of Mackey and Varadarajan for the locally compact case. We prove an analog of Tarski's theorem on paradoxical decompositions by showing that the existence of an invariant Borel probability measure is equivalent to the nonexistence of paradoxical decompositions with countably many Borel pieces. We show that various natural versions of the Topological Vaught Conjecture are equivalent with each other and, in the case of the group of permutations of $\Bbb N$, with the model-theoretic Vaught Conjecture for infinitary logic; this depends on our identification of the universal action for that group. "
"A method for calculating loop amplitudes at the multiboson threshold is presented, based on Feynman-diagram techniques. We explicitly calculate the one-loop amplitudes in both $\phi^4$-symmetric and broken symmetry cases, using dimensional regularization. We argue that, to all orders in the perturbation expansion, the unitarity-violating behaviour of the tree-order amplitudes persists. "
We characterize the Zariski topologies over an algebraically closed field in terms of general dimension-theoretic properties. Some applications are given to complex manifold and to strongly minimal sets. 
"The main aim of this paper is to present the ideas which lead first to the solution of the unitarizability problem for $\GL(n)$ over nonarchimedean local fields and to the recognition that the same result holds over archimedean local fields, a result which was proved by Vogan using an internal approach. Let us say that the approach that we are going to present may be characterized as external. At no point do we go into the internal structure of representations. "
"We study the average case complexity of multivariate integration and $L_2$ function approximation for the class $F=C([0,1]^d)$ of continuous functions of $d$ variables. The class $F$ is endowed with the isotropic Wiener measure (Brownian motion in Levy's sense). Furthermore, for both problems, only function values are used as data. "
"The superstring in $D\!=\!3,4$ and 6 is invariant under an $N\!=\!D\!-\!2$ superconformal algebra based on $\widehat{S^{D-3}}$. There is a direct relationship between this (world-sheet) symmetry and the super-Poincar\'e (target space) symmetry. We establish this relationship using the light-cone gauge, show how the statement generalizes to $D\!=\!10$ and examine the properties of the $N\!=\!8$ superconformal algebra and the possible implications of its existence. "
"This is a review of the Cold Dark Matter model of structure formation, and its variants. The approach is largely from first principles, the main aim being to impart a basic understanding of the relevant theory with an eye to the likely intense activity of the next few years, but the current observational status of the model is also critically assessed. The evolution of adiabatic and isocurvature density perturbations is described, and their effect on the large scale cmb anisotropy calculated as well as that of any gravitational waves. The generation of all three types of perturbation during inflation is described, and the normalisation and spectral indices are calculated in terms of the inflationary potential and its first and second derivatives. The comparison of the theory with each type of observation is described, starting with the COBE data and moving down in scale to the non-linear regime. Constraints on the spectrum of the adiabatic density perturbation are exhibited, the spectrum being parametrised by its normalisation and its degree of tilt. Finally extensions of the CDM model are considered, which replace some of the cold dark matter by hot dark matter or a cosmological constant. "
"The Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with the matter degrees of freedom is considered. The classical model is exactly solvable and its solutions describe non-trivial gravitational scattering of matter wave-packets. For huge amount of the solutions the scattering space-times are free of curvature singularities. However, the quantum corrections to the field equations inevitably cause the formation of (thunderbolt) curvature singularities, vanishing only in the limit $\hbar\to 0$. The singularities cut the space-time and disallow propagation to the future.The model is inspired by the dimensional reduction of 4-d pure Einstein gravity, restricted to the space-times with two commuting space-like Killing vectors. The matter degrees of freedom also stem from the 4-d ansatz. The measures for the continual integrations are judiciously chosen and one loop contributions (including the graviton and the dilaton ones) are evaluated. For the number of the matter fields $N=24$ we obtain even the exact effective action, applying the DDK-procedure. The effective action is nonlocal, but the semiclassical equations can be solved by using some theory of the Hankel transformations. "
"Recent research has indicated that negative energy fluxes due to quantum coherence effects obey uncertainty principle-type inequalities of the form $|\Delta E|\,{\Delta \tau} \lprox 1\,$. Here $|\Delta E|$ is the magnitude of the negative energy which is transmitted on a timescale $\Delta \tau$. Our main focus in this paper is on negative energy fluxes which are produced by the motion of observers through static negative energy regions. We find that although a quantum inequality appears to be satisfied for radially moving geodesic observers in two and four-dimensional black hole spacetimes, an observer orbiting close to a black hole will see a constant negative energy flux. In addition, we show that inertial observers moving slowly through the Casimir vacuum can achieve arbitrarily large violations of the inequality. It seems likely that, in general, these types of negative energy fluxes are not constrained by inequalities on the magnitude and duration of the flux. We construct a model of a non-gravitational stress-energy detector, which is rapidly switched on and off, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of such a detector. "
"The string equivalent of a massless particle ($m=0$) is the tensionless string ($T=0$). The study of such strings is of interest when trying to understand the high energy limit of ordinary strings. I discuss the classical $T\to 0$ limit of the bosonic string, the spinning string and the superstring. A common feature is the appearence of a space-time (super-)conformal symmetry replacing the world-sheet Weyl invariance. The question of whether this symmetry may survive quantization is addressed. A lightcone analysis of the quantized bosonic tensionless string leads to severe constraints on the physical states: they are space-time diffeomorphism singlets characterized by their topological properties only. "
"In this article we shall give an account of certain developments in knot theory which followed upon the discovery of the Jones polynomial in 1984. The focus of our account will be recent glimmerings of understanding of the topological meaning of the new invariants. A second theme will be the central role that braid theory has played in the subject. A third will be the unifying principles provided by representations of simple Lie algebras and their universal enveloping algebras. These choices in emphasis are our own. They represent, at best, particular aspects of the far-reaching ramifications that followed the discovery of the Jones polynomial. "
"In this paper, we consider the question of existence and uniqueness of absolutely continuous invariant measures for expanding $C^1$ maps of the circle. This is a question which arises naturally from results which are known in the case of expanding $C^k$ maps of the circle where $k\geq 2$, or even $C^{1+\epsilon}$ expanding maps of the circle. In these cases, it is known that there exists a unique absolutely continuous invariant probability measure by the so-called `Folklore Theorem'. It follows that this measure is ergodic. It has been shown however that for $C^1$ maps there need not be any such measure. However, this leaves the question of whether there can be more than one such measure for $C^1$ expanding maps of the circle. This is the subject of this paper, and in it, we show that there exists a $C^1$ expanding map of the circle which has more than one absolutely continuous invariant probability measure. "
"We construct examples of nonresolvable generalized $n$-manifolds, $n\geq 6$, with arbitrary resolution obstruction, homotopy equivalent to any simply connected, closed $n$-manifold. We further investigate the structure of generalized manifolds and present a program for understanding their topology. "
"This article, written in honor of Fritz Rohrlich, briefly surveys the role of topology in physics. "
"We investigate the hitherto unexplored relation between the superparticle path integral and superfield theory. Requiring that the path integral has the global symmetries of the classical action and obeys the natural composition property of path integrals, and also that the discretized action has the correct naive continuum limit, we find a viable discretization of the (D=3,N=2) free superparticle action. The resulting propagator is not the usual superfield one. We extend the discretization to include the coupling to an external gauge supermultiplet and use this to show the equivalence to superfield theory. This is possible since we are able to reformulate the superfield perturbation theory in terms of our new propagator. "
"The critical behaviour of the one-dimensional q-state Potts model with long-range interactions decaying with distance r as $r^{-(1+\sigma)}$ has been studied in the wide range of parameters $0 < \sigma \le 1$ and $\frac{1}{16} \le q \le 64$. A transfer matrix has been constructed for a truncated range of interactions for integer and continuous q, and finite range scaling has been applied. Results for the phase diagram and the correlation length critical exponent are presented. "
We investigate the occurrence and nature of naked singularity for the inhomogeneous gravitational collapse of Tolman-Bondi dust clouds.It is shown that the naked singularities form at the center of the collapsing cloud in a wide class of collapse models which includes the earlier cases considered by Eardley and Smarr and Christodoulou. This class also contains self-similar as well as non-self-similar models. The structure and strength of this singularity is examined and the question is investigated as to when a non-zero measure set of non-spacelike trajectories could be emitted from the singularity as opposed to isolated trajectories coming out. It is seen that the weak energy condition and positivity of energy density ensures that the families of non-spacelike trajectories come out of the singularity. The curvature strength of the naked singularity is examined which provides an important test for its physical significance and powerful curvature growth near the naked singularity is pointed out for several subclasses considered. The conditions are discussed for the naked singularity to be globally naked. Implications for the basic issue of the final fate of gravitational collapse are considered once the inhomogeneities in the matter distribution are taken into account. It is argued that a physical formulation for the cosmic censorship may be evolved which avoids the features above. Possibilities in this direction are discussed while indicating that the analysis presented here should be useful for any possible rigorous formulation of the cosmic censorship hypothesis. 
"An Effective Lagrangian description is useful for describing potential physics beyond the Standard Model. The method is illustrated by reference to interactions among the electroweak bosons ($W^\pm$ \& $Z^0$). The resulting estimates of the magnitude of these corrections suggest that they would be at best marginally detectable at high energy $e^-e^+$ colliders or hadron colliders. In loop calculations, contrary to lore, such deviations from Standard Model self-couplings never give observable corrections that grow as a power of the scale $\Lambda$ at which new physics enters, so there are never effects proportional to powers of $\Lambda/M_W$. "
We discuss the new Coulomb gauge method for testing confinement and measuring the string tension in the context of the Schwinger model and compact QED in 3 dimensions. 
"We develop a systematic analysis of quark mass matrices which, starting with the measured values of quark masses and mixing angles, allows for a model independent search for all possible (symmetric or hermitian) mass matrices having texture zeroes at the unification scale. A survey of all six and five texture zero structures yields a total of five possible solutions which may be distinguished by improved measurements of the CKM matrix elements and which may readily be extended to include lepton masses with the Georgi-Jarlskog texture. The solutions naturally suggest a parameterisation for the mass matrices based on a perturbative expansion and we present some speculations concerning the origin of such structure. "
"We analyze the microscopic, topological structure of the interface between domains of opposite magnetization in 3D Ising model near the critical point. This interface exhibits a fractal behaviour with a high density of handles. The mean area is an almost linear function of the genus. The entropy exponent is affected by strong finite-size effects. "
"A discrete string theory --a theory of embeddings from ${\bf Z}\times {\bf Z}_C\to {\bf R}^D$, where $C$ is the number of components of the string-- is explored. The closure of the algebra of constraints (`${\bf Z}_C$-Virasoro algebra') is exhibited. The ${\bf Z}_C$-Virasoro `algebra' is shown to be anomaly free in arbitrary number of target space dimensions. We prove the existence of a (manifestly unitary) light-cone gauge with anomaly free Lorentz algebra in any dimensions. The analog of vertex operators are introduced and the physical spectrum is analysed. There are an infinite number of higher-level states repeating a certain mass pattern and leading to an infinite degeneracy. The connection with the continuum string theory (in $D=26$) is investigated. Independently, following a method recently introduced by 't Hooft based on Hilbert-space extension of deterministic systems, a particular one-dimensional cellular automaton submitted to a deterministic evolution is shown to reduce to a massless scalar field theory at long distance scales. This automaton is utilized to define a (`cellular') string theory with world-sheet variables evolving under deterministic rules, which in the framework of `first-quantization' corresponds to the ${\bf Z}_C$ string theory mentioned above. We show that in this theory also the target space motion of free strings is governed by deterministic laws. Finally, we discuss a model for (off-shell) interacting strings where space-time determinism is fully restored. "
"It has been recently speculated that global symmetries are broken by gravity. We propose a scenario for the generation of the baryon asymmetry in the early Universe in which the domain walls predicted by theories with discrete symmetries become unstable due to these Planck scale effects. The relative motion of the decaying walls can provide a mechanism for the departure from thermal equilibrium necessary to have a nonvanishing baryon asymmetry. In particular, we implement this idea within the frameworks of the Left-Right and Quark-Lepton symmetric models. "
"We derive and evaluate expressions for the frictional Coulomb drag between disordered two-dimensional electron gas layers. Our derivation is based on the memory-function formalism and the expression for the drag reduces to previously known results in the ballistic limit. We find that Coulomb drag is appreciably enhanced by disorder at low temperatures when the mean-free-path within a layer is comparable to or shorter than the layer separation. In high mobility two-dimensional electron gas systems, where the drag has been studied experimentally, the effect of disorder on the drag is negligible at attainable temperatures. We predict that an enhancement due to disorder and a crossover in the temperature-dependence and layer-separation dependence will be observable at low temperatures in moderate and low mobility samples. "
"The status of the present precision measurements of electroweak observables is reviewed with specific reference to the radiative parameters $S,T,U$ or equivalently $\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2,\epsilon_3$. The significance of the obliqueness hypothesis is underlined and the importance of the ``local fit'' method of extracting these parameters from the data is emphasized. Possible new physics implications are briefly touched upon. "
We propose a new method to describe the interacting bose gas at zero temperature. We use the decomposition of the logarithm of the wave function into the irreducible $n$-point functions. We argue that in the low density limit this expansion corresponds to the expansion of the ground-state energy in powers of the small parameter. For three-dimensional system the correction to the ground-state energy in density is reproduced. For two-dimensional dilute bose gas the ground- state energy in the leading order in the parameter $|\ln\a^2\rho|^{-1}$ where $\a$ is a scattering length is obtained. 
"Cosmological perturbations generated quantum-mechanically (as a particular case, during inflation) possess statistical properties of squeezed quantum states. The power spectra of the perturbations are modulated and the angular distribution of the produced temperature fluctuations of the CMBR is quite specific. An exact formula is derived for the angular correlation function of the temperature fluctuations caused by squeezed gravitational waves. The predicted angular pattern can, in principle, be revealed by the COBE-type observations. "
"Within the framework of the minimum quadratic Poincare gauge theory of gravity in the Riemann-Cartan spacetime the dynamics of homogeneous anisotropic Bianchi types I-IX spinning-fluid cosmological models is investigated. A basic equation set for these models is obtained and analyzed. In particular, exact solutions for the Bianchi type-I spinning-fluid and Bianchi type-V perfect-fluid models are found in analytic form. "
Recently the development of chiral perturbation theory has allowed the generation of rigorous low-energy theorems for various hadronic processes based only on the chiral invariance of the underlying QCD Lagrangian. Herein we examine the experimental implications of chiral symmetry in the regime of electroweak Goldstone boson interactions. Contribution to BNL Hadronic Beam Physics Workshop. 
"Inspired by the model of Nambu and Jona-Lasinio, various Lagrangians are considered for a system of interacting quarks. Employing standard techniques of many-body theory, the scalar part of the quark self-energy is calculated including terms up to second-order in the interaction. Results obtained for the single-particle Green's function are compared with those which only account for the mean-field or Hartree-Fock term in the self-energy. Depending on the explicit form of the Lagrangian, the second-order contributions range between 4 and 90 percent of the leading Hartree-Fock term. This leads to a considerable momentum dependence of the self-energy and the effective mass of the quarks. "
"The string propagation in the two-dimensional stringy black-hole is investigated from a new approach. We completely solve the classical and quantum string dynamics in the lorentzian and euclidean regimes. In the lorentzian case all the physics reduces to a massless scalar particle described by a Klein-Gordon type equation with a singular effective potential. The scattering matrix is found and it reproduces the results obtained by coset CFT techniques. It factorizes into two pieces : an elastic coulombian amplitude and an absorption part. In both parts, an infinite sequence of imaginary poles in the energy appear. The generic features of string propagation in curved D-dimensional backgrounds (string stretching, fall into spacetime singularities) are analyzed in the present case. A new physical phenomenon specific to the present black-hole is found : the quantum renormalization of the speed of light. We find $c_{quantum} = \sqrt{{k\o{k-2}}}~c_{classical}$, where $k$ is the integer in front of the WZW action. This feature is, however, a pathology. Only for $ k \to \infty$ the pathology disappears (although the conformal anomaly is present). We analyze all the classical euclidean string solutions and exactly compute the quantum partition function. No critical Hagedorn temperature appears here. "
"It is expected that the only effect of heavy dynamical fermions in QCD is to renormalize the gauge coupling. We derive a simple expression for the shift in the gauge coupling induced by $N_f$ flavors of heavy fermions. We compare this formula to the shift in the gauge coupling at which the confinement-deconfinement phase transition occurs (at fixed lattice size) from numerical simulations as a function of quark mass and $N_f$. We find remarkable agreement with our expression down to a fairly light quark mass. However, simulations with eight heavy flavors and two light flavors show that the eight flavors do more than just shift the gauge coupling. We observe confinement-deconfinement transitions at $\beta=0$ induced by a large number of heavy quarks. We comment on the relevance of our results to contemporary simulations of QCD which include dynamical fermions. "
"This is a phenomenological review of $R$ parity violating SUSY models, with particular emphasis on explicit $R$ parity violation. "
"A Banach space is polyhedral if the unit ball of each of its finite dimensional subspaces is a polyhedron. It is known that a polyhedral Banach space has a separable dual and is $c_0$-saturated, i.e., each closed infinite dimensional subspace contains an isomorph of $c_0$. In this paper, we show that the Orlicz sequence space $h_M$ is isomorphic to a polyhedral Banach space if $\lim_{t\to 0}M(Kt)/M(t) = \infty$ for some $K < \infty$. We also construct an Orlicz sequence space $h_M$ which is $c_0$-saturated, but which is not isomorphic to any polyhedral Banach space. This shows that being $c_0$-saturated and having a separable dual are not sufficient for a Banach space to be isomorphic to a polyhedral Banach space. "
"A recent general analysis of light-baryon isospin splittings is updated and extended to charmed baryons. The measured $\Sigma_c$ and $\Xi_c$ splittings stand out as being difficult to understand in terms of two-body forces alone. We also discuss heavy-light mesons; though the framework here is necessarily less general, we nevertheless obtain some predictions that are not strongly model-dependent. "
"A dynamical theory which incorporates the electron-electron correlations and the effects of external magnetic fields for an electron escaping from a helium surface is presented. The degrees of freedom in the calculation of the escape rate is reduced from $3N$ to 3 as compared with other approach. Explicit expressions for the escape rate in various situations are obtained. In particular, in the weak parallel magnetic field limit the tunneling rate has an exponential dependence quadratic with magnetic field strength and an unusual exponential increase linear with temperature. "
"As long as there is no distance indicator to the sources of gamma-ray bursts all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list. We use the available data on the bursts' distribution of (the BATSE catalogue), and the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits by Marsden and Williams (1992) to investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations between the angular distributions of bursts and comets' aphelia, assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect, at least to some extent, true variations in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the V/V_{max} test to both distributions. We have performed a variety of statistical tests (a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a $\chi^2$ test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D cross-correlation analysis), including testing sub-samples for isolating the effect of possible observational biases. These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree, but the statistical significance is not sufficient for ruling out any connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\sim 800$ it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions. Currently, it is only the combination of these tests with the large disagreement found for the V/V_{max} parameter which makes the Oort cloud of comets unlikely to be related to gamma-ray bursts. "
"We investigate the use of effective Lagrangians to describe the effects on high-precision observables of physics beyond the Standard Model. Using the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon as an example, we detail the use of effective vertices in loop calculations. We then provide estimates of the sensitivity of new experiments measuring the muon's $ g - 2 $ to the scale of physics underlying the Standard Model. "
"The wandering exponent $\nu$ for an isotropic polymer is predicted remarkably well by a simple argument due to Flory. By considering oriented polymers living in a one-parameter family of background tangent fields, we are able to relate the wandering exponent to the exponent in the background field through an $\epsilon$-expansion. We then choose the background field to have the same correlations as the individual polymer, thus self-consistently solving for $\nu$. We find $\nu=3/(d+2)$ for $d<4$ and $\nu=1/2$ for $d\ge 4$, which is exactly the Flory result. "
"We show that the description of the electroweak interactions based on noncommutative geometry of a continuous and a discrete space gives no special relations between the Higgs mass and other parameters of the model. We prove that there exists a gauge invariant term, linear in the curvature, which is trivial in the standard differential geometry but nontrivial in the case of the discrete geometry. The relations could appear only if one neglects this term, otherwise one gets the Lagrangian of the Standard model with the exact number of free parameters. "
"The dissipative Hofstadter model describes the quantum mechanics of a charged particle in two dimensions subject to a periodic potential, uniform magnetic field, and dissipative force. Its phase diagram exhibits an SL(2,Z) duality symmetry and has an infinite number of critical circles in the dissipation/magnetic field plane. In addition, multi-critical points on a particular critical circle correspond to non-trivial solutions of open string theory. The duality symmetry is expected to provide relations between correlation functions at different multi-critical points. Many of these correlators are contact terms. However we expect them to have physical significance because under duality they transform into functions that are non-zero for large separations of the operators. Motivated by the search for exact, regulator independent solutions for these contact terms, in this paper we derive many properties and symmetries of the coordinate correlation functions at the special multi-critical points. In particular, we prove that the correlation functions are homogeneous, piecewise-linear functions of the momenta, and we prove a weaker version of the anticipated duality transformation. Consequently, the possible forms of the correlation functions are limited to lie in a finite dimensional linear space. We treat the potential perturbatively and these results are valid to all orders in perturbation theory. "
"We use a Hodge decomposition and its generalization to non-abelian flat vector bundles to calculate the partition function for abelian and non- abelian BF theories in $n$ dimensions. This enables us to provide a simple proof that the partition function is related to the Ray-Singer torsion defined on flat vector bundles for all odd-dimensional manifolds, and is equal to unity for even dimensions.

"An effective chiral Lagrangian in heavy-fermion formalism whose parameters are constrained by kaon-nucleon and kaon-nuclear interactions next to the leading order in chiral expansion is used to describe kaon condensation in dense ``neutron star"" matter. The critical density is found to be robust with respect to the parameters of the chiral Lagrangian and comes out to be $\rho_c\sim (3 - 4)\rho_0$. Once kaon condensation sets in, the system is no longer composed of neutron matter but of nuclear matter. Possible consequences on stellar collapse with the formation of compact ``nuclear stars"" or light-mass black holes are pointed out. "
"We calculate reduced moments $\overline \xi_q$ of the matter density fluctuations, up to order $q=5$, from counts in cells produced by Particle--Mesh numerical simulations with scale--free Gaussian initial conditions. We use power--law spectra $P(k) \propto k^n$ with indices $n=-3,~-2,~-1,~0,~1$. Due to the supposed absence of characteristic times or scales in our models, all quantities are expected to depend on a single scaling variable. For each model, the moments at all times can be expressed in terms of the variance $\overline \xi_2$, alone. We look for agreement with the hierarchical scaling ansatz, according to which $\overline \xi_q \propto \overline \xi_2^{~q-1}$. For $n\leq -2$ models we find strong deviations from the hierarchy, which are mostly due to the presence of boundary problems in the simulations. A small, residual signal of deviation from the hierarchical scaling is however also found in $n \geq -1$ models. For the first time, due to our large dynamic range and careful checks of scaling and shot--noise effects, we are able to detect evolution away from the perturbation theory result. "
"It is suggested that gravity waves could, in several cases, be detected by means of already (or shortly to be) available technology, independently of current efforts of detection. The present is a follow-up on a recently suggested detection strategy based on gravity-wave-induced deviations of null geodesics. The new development is that a way was found to probe the waves close to the source, where they are several orders of magnitude larger than on the Earth. The effect translates into apparent shifts in stellar angular positions that could be as high as $10^{-7}$ arcsec, which is just about the present theoretical limit of detectability. (Calculation improved; results unchanged.) "
"Daily monitoring of PKS 2155-304 with the IUE satellite throughout November 1991 has revealed dramatic, large-amplitude, rapid variations in the ultraviolet flux of this BL Lac object. Many smaller, rapid flares are superimposed on a general doubling of the intensity. During the five-day period when sampling was roughly continuous, the rapid flaring had an apparent quasi-periodic nature, with peaks repeating every ~0.7 days. The short- and long-wavelength ultraviolet light curves are well correlated with each other, and with the optical light curve deduced from the Fine Error Sensor (FES) on IUE. The formal lag is zero but the cross-correlation if asymmetric in the sense that the shorter wavelength emission leads the longer. The ultraviolet spectral shape varies a small but significant amount. The correlation between spectral shape and intensity is complicated; an increase in intensity is associated with spectral hardening, but lags behind the spectral change by ~1 day. The sign of the correlation is consistent with the nonthermal acceleration processes expected in relativistic plasmas, so that the present results are consistent with relativistic jet models, which can also account for quasi-periodic flaring. In contrast, currently proposed accretion disk models are stronly ruled out by the simultaneous optical and ultraviolet variability. "
"It is argued that the problems of the cosmological constant, stability and renormalizability of quantum gravity can be solved if the space-time manifold arises through spontaneous symmetry breaking. A ``pre-manifold"" model is presented in which many points are connected by random bonds. A set of $D$ real numbers assigned to each point are coupled between points connected by bonds. It is then found that the dominant configuration of bonds is a flat $D$-dimensional manifold, on which there is a massless matter field. Long-wavelength fluctuations can describe quantized massless gravity if $D=\;4$, $6$, $8...$. "
"Each cell of a two-dimensional lattice is painted one of k colors, arranged in a ""color wheel."" The colors advance (0 to k-1 mod k) either automatically or by contact with at least a threshold number of successor colors in a prescribed local neighborhood. Discrete-time parallel systems of this sort in which color 0 updates by contact and the rest update automatically are called Greenberg-Hastings (GH) rules. A system in which all colors update by contact is called a cyclic cellular automaton (CCA). Started from appropriate initial conditions these models generate periodic traveling waves. Started from random configurations the same rules exhibit complex self-organization, typically characterized by nucleation of locally periodic ""ram's horns"" or spirals. Corresponding random processes give rise to a variety of ""forest fire"" equilibria that display large-scale stochastic wave fronts. This article describes a framework, theoretically based, but relying on extensive interactive computer graphics experimentation, for investigation of the complex dynamics shared by excitable media in a broad spectrum of scientific contexts. By focusing on simple mathematical prototypes we obtain a better understanding of the basic organizational principles underlying spatially-distributed oscillating systems. "
The see-saw mechanism of neutrino mass generation may enhance lepton mixing up to maximal even if the Dirac mass matrices of leptons have structure similar to that in the quark sector. Two sets of conditions for such an enhancement are found. The first one includes the see-saw generation of heavy Majorana masses for right-handed neutrinos and a universality of Yukawa couplings which can follow from the unification of neutrinos with new superheavy neutral leptons. The second set is related to lepton number symmetry of the Yukawa interactions in the Dirac basis of neutrinos. Models which realize these conditions have strong hierarchy or strong degeneration of Majorana masses of the right-handed neutrinos. 
We report on a considerable improvement in the technique of measuring multiparticle correlations via integrals over correlation functions. A modification of measures used in the characterization of chaotic dynamical sytems permits fast and flexible calculation of factorial moments and cumulants as well as their differential versions. Higher order correlation integral measurements even of large multiplicity events such as encountered in heavy ion collisons are now feasible. The change from ``ordinary'' to ``factorial'' powers may have important consequences in other fields such as the study of galaxy correlations and Bose-Einstein interferometry. 
The Wess-Zumino consistency conditions for Lorentz and diffeomorphism anomalies are discussed by introducing an operator 'delta' which allows to decompose the exterior derivative as a BRS commutator. 
"The intermediate mass Higgs (IMH) can be abundantly produced through the process $e^-\gamma \rightarrow W^-H\nu$ at TeV $e^-\gamma$ colliders, which are realized by the laser back-scattering method. We search for the signature of $W^-H \rightarrow (jj)(b\bar b)$ plus missing transverse momentum, with and without considering the $b$-tagging. We also analyse all the potential backgrounds from $e^-\gamma \rightarrow W^-Z\nu,\,W^-W^+e^-,\,ZZe^-,\, \bar t b\nu$ and $t\bar t e^-$. With our selective acceptance cuts these backgrounds are reduced to a manageable level. We find that for the entire intermediate mass range 60 -- 150~GeV the Higgs discovery should be viable. We also present detail formulas for the helicity amplitudes of these processes. "
"The dynamical systems of the form $\ddot\bold r=\bold F (\bold r,\dot\bold r)$ in $\Bbb R^n$ accepting the normal shift are considered. The concept of weak normality for them is introduced. The partial differential equations for the force field $\bold F(\bold r,\dot\bold r)$ of the dynamical systems with weak and complete normality are derived. "
"We extend our previous work on non-linear realization of the top quark field, which is a consequence of its being much heavier than any other scales. One loop effective Lagrangian to account for virtual top effects is constructed in this article, for processes where there are two external fermions, as well as any number of bosons. Particularly, we focus on those terms which have power dependence on the top mass $m_t$. "
"We show that the Wang-Swendsen-Koteck\'y algorithm for antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts models is nonergodic at zero temperature for $q=3$ on periodic $3m \times 3n$ lattices where $m,n$ are relatively prime. For $q \ge 4$ and/or other lattice sizes or boundary conditions, the ergodicity at zero temperature is an open question. "
"We show that the normalization integral for the Schr\""odinger and Dirac scattering wave functions contains, besides the usual delta-function, a term proportional to the derivative of the phase shift. This term is of zero measure with respect to the integration over momentum variables and can be discarded in most cases. Yet it carries the full information on phase shifts and can be used for computation and manipulation of quantities which depend on phase shifts. In this paper we prove Levinson's theorem in a most general way which assumes only the completeness of states. In the case of a Dirac particle we obtain a new result valid for positive and negative energies separately. We also make a generalization of known results, for the phase shifts in the asymptotic limit of high energies, to the case of singular potentials. As an application we consider certain equations, which arise in a generalized interaction picture of quantum electrodynamics. Using the above mentioned results for the phase shifts we prove that any solution of these equations, which has a finite number of bound states, has a total charge zero. Furthermore, we show that in these equations the coupling constant is not a free parameter, but rather should be treated as an eigenvalue and hence must have a definite numerical value. "
"We extend previous work on sum rules for the invariant amplitudes of pion Compton scattering by deriving a complete lowest order perturbative spectral function - and its leading non perturbative power corr ections - for a specific combination of the two helicities $(H_1 + H_2)$ of this process. Using some properties of a modified version of the Borel transform, we develop a method of calculation of the gluonic corrections which can be easily extended to other similar reactions, such as proton Compton scattering. A preliminary comparison of the new sum rule with the pion form factor sum rule is made. "
"We prove that the Thin Sandwich Conjecture in general relativity is valid, provided that the data $(g_{ab},\dot g_{ab})$ satisfy certain geometric conditions. These conditions define an open set in the class of possible data, but are not generically satisfied. The implications for the ``superspace'' picture of the Einstein evolution equations are discussed. "
"A precision measurement of atmospheric electron fluxes has been performed on a Japanese commercial airliner (Enomoto, {\it et al.}, 1991). We have performed a monte carlo calculation of the cosmic ray secondary electron fluxes expected in this experiment. The monte carlo uses the hadronic portion of our neutrino flux cascade program combined with the electromagnetic cascade portion of the CERN library program GEANT. Our results give good agreement with the data, provided we boost the overall normalization of the primary cosmic ray flux by 12\% over the normalization used in the neutrino flux calculation. "
"We have investigated the appearance of chaos in the 1-dimensional Newtonian gravitational three-body system (three masses on a line with $-1/r$ pairwise potential). We have concentrated in particular on how the behavior changes when the relative masses of the three bodies change (with negative total energy). For two mass choices we have calculated 18000 full orbits (with initial states on a $100\times 180$ lattice on the Poincar\'e section) and obtained dwell time distributions. For 105 mass choices we have calculated Poincar\'e maps for $10\times 18$ starting points. Our results show that the Poincar\'e section (and hence the phase space) divides into three well defined regions with orbits of different characteristics: 1) There is a region of fast scattering, with a minimum of pairwise collisions and smooth dependence on initial values. 2) In the chaotic scattering region the interaction times are longer, and both the interaction time and the final state depend sensitively on the starting point on the Poincar\'e section. For both 1) and 2) the initial and final states consists of a binary + single particle. 3) The third region consists of quasiperiodic orbits where the three masses are bound together forever. At the center of the quasiperiodic region there is the periodic Schubart orbit, whose stability turns out to correlate strongly with the global behavior. "
"We evaluate, in the high-energy limit, $s\gg|t|\gg m^2\gg\lambda^2$, the sum of amplitudes corresponding to a class of Feynman diagrams describing two-loop virtual photonic corrections to Bhabha scattering. The diagrams considered are box and crossed box diagrams with an extra photon decorating one of the fermion lines. The mathematical method employed is that of Mellin transforms. In the eikonal approximation, this sum of two-loop amplitudes has previously been evaluated, and found to be equal to the sum of the box and crossed box amplitudes, multiplied by the electric form factor of the electron. We obtain a similar factorization, but with the form factor replaced by another expression involving the logarithms $\log(\lambda^2/m^2)$ and $\log(\lambda^2/|t|)$. "
"It has been conjectured that at distances smaller than the confinement scale but large enough to allow for nonperturbative effects, QCD is described by an effective $SU(N_c {\times} N_f)_L\times SU(N_c {\times} N_f)_R$ chiral Lagrangian. The soliton solutions of such a Lagrangian are extended objects with spin ${1\over 2}$. For $N_c{=}3$, $N_f{=}3$ they are triplets of color and flavor and have baryon number ${1\over3}$, to be identified as constituent quarks. We investigate in detail the static properties of such constituent-quark solitons for the simplest case $N_f{=}1, N_c{=}3$. The mass of these objects comes from the energy of the static soliton and from quantum effects, described semiclassically by rotation of collective coordinates around the classical solution. The quantum corrections tend to be large, but can be controlled by exploring the Lagrangian's parameter space so as to maximize the inertia tensor. We comment on the acceptable parameter space and discuss the model's further predictive power. "
"It is shown that gauged nonlinear sigma models can be always deformed by terms proportional to the field strength of the gauge fields (nonminimal gauging). These deformations can be interpreted as perturbations, by marginal operators, of conformal coset models. When applied to the SL(2,R)*SU(2)/[U(1)*U(1)] WZWN model, a large class of four-dimensional curved spacetime backgrounds are obtained. In particular, a naked singularity may form at a time when the volume of the universe is different from zero. "
"We present a phenomenological description for an unstable fermion based upon one-loop renormalization of quantum field theory. It is emphasized that wave function renormalization can introduce important $CP$-conserving and $CP$-violating phases. Implications for the study of $CP$ violation are examined. Applications are given to $CP$-violating asymmetries in the $t$ decays: $t\to bW^+, bH^+$, in which we show that a naive calculation following the standard rule either is incomplete or violates $CPT$. "
"It has been pointed out that cosmic string solutions can exist in gauge field theories with broken symmetry even when $\pi _1(G/H)$ is trivial. The stability of such semilocal defects is not guaranteed by topology and depends on dynamical considerations. In the literature it has been tacitly assumed that if stable, such strings would form in the Early Universe in a manner analogous to the formation of a network of more robust topologically-stable strings. In this paper we find that except for unnaturally small values of the correlation length, a network of semilocal strings does not form. Instead, delocalized skyrmionic string configurations, which expand with the Hubble flow, dominate. "
"We present the most general supersymmetric amplitude for \kkb\/ and \bbb\/ mixing resulting from gluino box diagrams. We use this amplitude to place general constraints on the magnitude of flavor-changing squark mass mixings, and compare these constraints to theoretical predictions both in and beyond the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. "
"We investigate the question of the proper thermal averaging of neutralino annihilation amplitudes which possess poles and thresholds, as they impact on the calculated neutralino relic density and therefore on the cosmological viability of supersymmetric models. We focus on two typical resonances, namely the $Z$ boson and the lightest Higgs boson ($h$). In the context of supergravity models with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking, an exploration of the whole parameter space of the model is possible and the overall relevance of these sophisticated analyses can be ascertained. As an example we chose the minimal $SU(5)$ supergravity model since the presence of such poles is essential to obtain a cosmologically acceptable model. We find that the proper thermal averaging is important for individual points in parameter space and that the fraction of cosmologically acceptable points is increased somewhat by the accurate procedure. However, qualitatively the new set of points is very similar to that obtained previously using the usual series approximations to the thermal average. We conclude that all phenomenological analyses based on the previously determined cosmologically allowed set remain valid. "
"As a first step of a program aimed to the detection of dark matter (or radial variations of M/L) in early-type galaxies, we report deep spectroscopic observations of the bulge-dominated edge-on S0 galaxy NGC 3115, made at ESO, La Silla, using EFOSC at the 3.6m telescope and EMMI at NTT. Such observations allow measurements of the rotational velocity out to 1.8 a_e (effective radii) from the galaxy center, where the surface brightness is \mu_B ~ 24 mag arcsec**-2. The rotation curve quickly reaches an asymptotic value, v_f ~ 260 km/s, with only marginal indication of systematic decline within the range of our observations. The line-of-sight velocity dispersion has also been measured; it decreases steeply from a rather high central value and flattens out (<\sigma> ~ 100 km/s) within our observing range (a ~< 1.3 a_e). Models built on these data and simple dynamical arguments show that the M/L of NGC 3115 must thus be increasing from M/L = 6 (in solar units) in the inner regions (~ 1 a_e) to at least M/L >= 10 in the outermost regions (~ 2 a_e). "
"We construct a gauge theory based on general nonlinear Lie algebras. The generic form of `dilaton' gravity is derived from nonlinear Poincar{\' e} algebra, which exhibits a gauge-theoretical origin of the non-geometric scalar field in two-dimensional gravitation theory. "
"We propose a new discrete approximation to the Einstein equations, based on the Capovilla-Dell-Jacobson form of the action for the Ashtekar variables. This formulation is analogous to the Regge calculus in that the curvature has support on sets of measure zero. Both a Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation are proposed and we report partial results about the constraint algebra of the Hamiltonian formulation. We find that the discrete versions of the diffeomorphism constraints do not commute with each other or with the Hamiltonian constraint. "
"We calculate the partition functions of QCD in two dimensions on a cylinder and on a torus in the gauge $\partial_{0} A_{0} = 0$ by integrating explicitly over the non zero modes of the Fourier expansion in the periodic time variable. The result is a one dimensional Kazakov-Migdal matrix model with eigenvalues on a circle rather than on a line. We prove that our result coincides with the standard expansion in representations of the gauge group. This involves a non trivial modular transformation from an expansion in exponentials of $g^2$ to one in exponentials of $1/g^2$. Finally we argue that the states of the $U(N)$ or $SU(N)$ partition function can be interpreted as a gas of N free fermions, and the grand canonical partition function of such ensemble is given explicitly as an infinite product.

"We derive new bounds on scalar leptoquark couplings from K^0 K^0 bar, D^0 D^0 bar and B^0 B^0 bar mixing. Although leptoquarks contribute to these processes only at one loop, their contribution is large, due to the lack of GIM cancelation. Our bounds have two important features: (i) They bound g^4/M^2, in contrast to the hitherto known bounds on g^2/M^2, and are consequently stronger at high masses. (ii) The bound from D^0 D^0 bar mixing is the first FCNC bound in the up sector for chirally-coupled leptoquarks, and is similar in strength to the K^0 K^0 bar and B^0 B^0 bar bounds. Together, these bounds strongly constrain any leptoquark that couples to left handed quarks. "
A Maxwell-Chern-Simons field is minimally coupled to 3D-gravity. Feynman rules are written down and 1-loop corrections to the gauge-field self-energy are calculated. Transversality is verified and gauge-field dynamical mass generation does not take place. 
"Intertwiners between \ade lattice models are presented and the general theory developed. The intertwiners are discussed at three levels: at the level of the adjacency matrices, at the level of the cell calculus intertwining the face algebras and at the level of the row transfer matrices. A convenient graphical representation of the intertwining cells is introduced. The utility of the intertwining relations in studying the spectra of the \ade models is emphasized. In particular, it is shown that the existence of an intertwiner implies that many eigenvalues of the \ade row transfer matrices are exactly in common for a finite system and, consequently, that the corresponding central charges and scaling dimensions can be identified. "
"These are the author's lectures at the 1992 Les Houches Summer School, ""Gravitation and Quantizations"". They develop a generalized sum-over-histories quantum mechanics for quantum cosmology that does not require either a preferred notion of time or a definition of measurement. The ""post-Everett"" quantum mechanics of closed systems is reviewed. Generalized quantum theories are defined by three elements (1) the set of fine-grained histories of the closed system which are its most refined possible description, (2) the allowed coarse grainings which are partitions of the fine-grained histories into classes, and (3) a decoherence functional which measures interference between coarse grained histories. Probabilities are assigned to sets of alternative coarse-grained histories that decohere as a consequence of the closed system's dynamics and initial condition. Generalized sum-over histories quantum theories are constructed for non-relativistic quantum mechanics, abelian gauge theories, a single relativistic world line, and for general relativity. For relativity the fine-grained histories are four-metrics and matter fields. Coarse grainings are four-dimensional diffeomorphism invariant partitions of these. The decoherence function is expressed in sum-over-histories form. The quantum mechanics of spacetime is thus expressed in fully spacetime form. The coarse-grainings are most general notion of alternative for quantum theory expressible in spacetime terms. Hamiltonian quantum mechanics of matter fields with its notion of unitarily evolving state on a spacelike surface is recovered as an approximation to this generalized quantum mechanics appropriate for those initial conditions and coarse-grainings such that spacetime geometry "
"A ri proof of the effective potential (lattice corrections included) deduced by Trullinger and Sasaki is given. Using asymptotic methods from the theory of differential equations depending on a large parameter, the lattice corrections to the kink and kink-kink contributions to the free energy are calculated. The results are in complete agreement with a first order correction to the energy of the static kink. "
Macroscopic loop amplitudes are obtained for the dilation gravity in two-dimensions. The dependence on the macroscopic loop length $l$ is completely determined by using the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the mini-superspace approximation. The dependence on the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is also determined by using the scaling argument in addition. 
The discussion on the asymptotical behaviour of the form factors in the space-like and time-like regions have been corrected and clarified. Fig.3 has been replaced by an improved analysis of the data. 
"The impact of pionic correlations and meson--exchange currents in determining the (vector) response functions for electroweak quasielastic lepton scattering from nuclei is discussed. The approach taken builds on previous work where the Fermi gas model is used to maintain consistency in treating forces and currents (gauge invariance) and to provide a Lorentz covariant framework. Results obtained in first-order perturbation theory are compared with infinite-order summation schemes (HF and RPA) and found to provide quite successful approximations for the quasielastic response functions. The role of pionic correlations in hardening the responses R_L and R_T is investigated in some detail, including studies of the relative importance of central and tensor pieces of the force and of exchange and self-energy diagrams; in addition, their role in significantly modifying the longitudinal parity-violating response R_{AV}^L is explored. The MEC are shown to provide a small, but non-negligible, contribution in determining the vector responses. "
"We consider a slab of nuclear matter and investigate the collective excitations, which develop in the response function of the system. We introduce a finite-range realistic interaction among the nucleons, which reproduces the full G-matrix by a linear combination of gaussian potentials in the various spin-isospin channels. We then analyze the collective modes of the slab in the S=T=1 channel: for moderate momenta hard and soft zero-sound modes are found, which exhaust most of the excitation strength. At variance with the results obtained with a zero range force, new ""massive"" excitations are found for the vector-isovector channel . "
We derive the lepton spectrum in semileptonic beauty decays from a nonperturbative treatment of QCD; it is based on an expansion in $1/m_Q$ with $m_Q$ being the heavy flavour quark mass. The leading corrections arising on the $1/m_Q$ level are completely expressed in terms of the difference in the mass of the heavy hadron and the quark. Nontrivial effects appear in $1/m_Q^2$ terms affecting mainly the endpoint region; they are different for meson and baryon decays as well as for beauty and charm decays. 
"The question of spin-charge separation in two-dimensional lattices has been addressed by numerical simulations of the motion of one hole in a half-filled band. The calculations have been performed on finite clusters with Hubbard and t-J models. By comparing the time evolution of spin and charge polarisation currents in one and two dimensions, evidence in favor of spin-charge separation in two dimensions is presented. In contrast with this, spin-charge separation is absent in a highly doped, metallic, system. "
"Based on the real-time formalism, especially, on Thermo Field Dynamics, we derive the Schwinger-Dyson gap equation for the fermion propagator in QED and Four-Fermion model at finite-temperature and -density. We discuss some advantage of the real-time formalism in solving the self-consistent gap equation, in comparison with the ordinary imaginary-time formalism. Once we specify the vertex function, we can write down the SD equation with only continuous variables without performing the discrete sum over Matsubara frequencies which cannot be performed in advance without further approximation in the imaginary-time formalism. By solving the SD equation obtained in this way, we find the chiral-symmetry restoring transition at finite-temperature and present the associated phase diagram of strong coupling QED. In solving the SD equation, we consider two approximations: instantaneous-exchange and $p_0$-independent ones. The former has a direct correspondence in the imaginary time formalism, while the latter is a new approximation beyond the former, since the latter is able to incorporate new thermal effects which has been overlooked in the ordinary imaginary-time solution. However both approximations are shown to give qualitatively the same results on the finite-temperature phase transition. "
"We present optical and IR surface photometry of M51 (NGC~5194) at B~V~R~I~J~K and CO$(2.3\mu )$. These data are used to establish whether K-band ($2.2\mu$) images of spiral galaxies provide reliable maps of stellar surface mass density features such as massive spiral arms or bars. The main distorting agents in the mapping at shorter wavelengths are dust extinction and luminous young stars. From modeling the color changes across the main dust lanes in M51, we find that the K-band flux is attenuated by only $\ltorder 10\%$ even in the dust lanes. From monitoring the gravity-sensitive CO$(2.3\mu )$ index across the spiral arms we find that young, red supergiants do not distort significantly the K-band image except in one small patch. On this basis, {\it we conclude that K band images do trace the massive disk star population}. In M51 we find the surface mass density contrast (arm/inter-arm) to range from 1.8 to 3, comparable to results from N-body simulations of the galaxy's tidal encounter with NGC~5195. The spiral arm amplitude in M51 also shows smooth, strong radial variations, with a maximum at $\sim 130\asec$ and minima at $45\asec$ and $170\asec$. "
"Recent calculations of $s$-wave pion production have severely underestimated the accurately known $pp\rightarrow pp\pi^0$\ total cross section near threshold. In these calculations, only the single-nucleon axial-charge operator is considered. We have calculated, in addition to the one-body term, the two-body contributions to this reaction that arise from the exchange of mesons. We find that the inclusion of the scalar $\sigma$-meson exchange current (and lesser contributions from other mesons) increases the cross section by about a factor of five, and leads to excellent agreement with the data. The results are neither very sensitive to changes in the distorting potential that generates the $NN$ wave function, nor to different choices for the meson-nucleon form factors. We argue that $pp\rightarrow pp\pi^0$\ data provide direct experimental evidence for meson-exchange contributions to the axial current. "
"We study the diffusion of helium and other heavy elements in the solar interior by solving exactly the set of flow equations developed by Burgers for a multi-component fluid, including the residual heat-flow terms. No approximation is made concerning the relative concentrations and no restriction is placed on the number of elements considered. We give improved diffusion velocities for hydrogen, helium, oxygen and iron, in the analytic form derived previously by Bahcall and Loeb. These expressions for the diffusion velocities are simple to program in stellar evolution codes and are expected to be accurate to $\sim 15\%$. Our complete treatment of element diffusion can be directly incorporated in a standard stellar evolution code by means of an exportable subroutine, but, for convenience, we also give simple analytical fits to our numerical results. "
We investigate the question of whether an additional light neutral scalar can explain the $l^+ l^- \gamma \gamma$ events with high invariant mass photon pairs recently observed by the L3 collaboration. We parameterize the low energy effects of the unknown dynamics in terms of higher dimensional effective operators. We show that operators which allow for the scalar to be produced and decay into photon pairs will allow other observable processes that should have been seen in current experiments. 
We review how external magnetic fields act as perfect probes of the non-abelian nature of the electroweak theory. 
"We considered a charged quantum mechanical particle with spin ${1\over 2}$ and gyromagnetic ratio $g\ne 2$ in the field af a magnetic string. Whereas the interaction of the charge with the string is the well kown Aharonov-Bohm effect and the contribution of magnetic moment associated with the spin in the case $g=2$ is known to yield an additional scattering and zero modes (one for each flux quantum), an anomaly of the magnetic moment (i.e. $g>2$) leads to bound states. We considered two methods for treating the case $g>2$. \\ The first is the method of self adjoint extension of the corresponding Hamilton operator. It yields one bound state as well as additional scattering. In the second we consider three exactly solvable models for finite flux tubes and take the limit of shrinking its radius to zero. For finite radius, there are $N+1$ bound states ($N$ is the number of flux quanta in the tube).\\ For $R\to 0$ the bound state energies tend to infinity so that this limit is not physical unless $g\to 2$ along with $R\to 0$. Thereby only for fluxes less than unity the results of the method of self adjoint extension are reproduced whereas for larger fluxes $N$ bound states exist and we conclude that this method is not applicable.\\ We discuss the physically interesting case of small but finite radius whereby the natural scale is given by the anomaly of the magnetic moment of the electron $a_e=(g-2)/2\approx 10^{-3}$. "
"We discuss the limits of validity of the semiclassical theory of gravity in which a classical metric is coupled to the expectation value of the stress tensor. It is argued that this theory is a good approximation only when the fluctuations in the stress tensor are small. We calculate a dimensionless measure of these fluctuations for a scalar field on a flat background in particular cases, including squeezed states and the Casimir vacuum state. It is found that the fluctuations are small for states which are close to a coherent state, which describes classical behavior, but tend to be large otherwise. We find in all cases studied that the energy density fluctuations are large whenever the local energy density is negative. This is taken to mean that the gravitational field of a system with negative energy density, such as the Casimir vacuum, is not described by a fixed classical metric but is undergoing large metric fluctuations. We propose an operational scheme by which one can describe a fluctuating gravitational field in terms of the statistical behavior of test particles. For this purpose we obtain an equation of the form of the Langevin equation used to describe Brownian motion. "
We consider the $C_2$ Toda theory in the reduced WZNW framework. Analysing the classical representation space of the symmetry algebra (which is the corresponding $C_2$ $W$ algebra) we determine its classical highest weight representations. We quantise the model promoting only the relevant quantities to operators. Using the quantised equation of motion we determine the selection rules for the $u$ field that corresponds to one of the Toda fields and give restrictions for its amplitude functions and for the structure of the Hilbert space of the model. 
"We construct a finite dimensional Kaehler manifold with a holomorphic, symplectic circle action whose symplectic reduced spaces may be identified with the tau-vortex moduli spaces (or tau-stable pairs). The Morse theory of the circle action induces natural birational maps between the reduced spaces for different values of tau which in the case of rank two bundles can be canonically resolved in a sequence of blow-ups and blow-downs. "
We analyze the decay modes of charmed mesons into two--pseudoscalars in a weak--gauged U(4)_L x U(4)_R chiral lagrangian model. The calculation is free of unknown parameters and only requires as inputs the masses of pseudoscalars and the decay constant of the pion. The general pattern of the results at leading order compares reasonably well with the experimental data. 
"The effective actions for $d=2$, $N=3,4$ chiral supergravities with a linear and a non-linear gauge algebra are related to each other by a quantum reduction, the latter is obtained from the former by putting quantum currents equal to zero. This implies that the renormalisation factors for the quantum actions are identical. "
"We study a revised version of Witten's 2d black hole, in which the matter and (b,c) ghosts are mixed. The level of the coset model is still 9/4. We show that this model is equivalent to that of Mukhi and Vafa, in which the level of the coset model is taken as 3, and the stress tensor is improved. We argue that the exact metric in such a model is just the semi-classical one, quite different from the exact metric in Witten's black hole, being studied by Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde. In addition, there appear ghost-related terms as a part of the background in the world sheet action. "
"We analyze the global structure of a family of Einstein-Maxwell solutions parametrized by mass, charge and cosmological constant. In a qualitative classification there are: (i) generic black-hole solutions, describing a Wheeler wormhole in a closed cosmos of spatial topology $S^2\times S^1$; (ii) generic naked-singularity solutions, describing a pair of ``point"" charges in a closed cosmos; (iii) extreme black-hole solutions, describing a pair of ``horned"" particles in an otherwise closed cosmos; (iv) extreme naked-singularity solutions, in which a pair of point charges forms and then evaporates, in a way which is not even weakly censored; and (v) an ultra-extreme solution. We discuss the properties of the solutions and of various coordinate systems, and compare with the Kastor-Traschen multi-black-hole solutions. "
"We investigate random lattices where the connectivities are determined by the Voronoi construction, while the location of the points are the dynamic degrees of freedom. The Voronoi random lattices with an associated energy are immersed in a heat bath and investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm. In thermodynamic equilibrium we measure coordination number distributions and test the Aboav-Weaire and Lewis laws. "
"A set of Grand Unified Theories based upon the gauge groups $SU(5)_\L \times SU(5)_\R$, $SO(10)_\L \times SO(10)_\R$ and $SU(4)_\C \times SU(4)_\L \times SU(4)_\R$ is explored. Several novel features distinguish these theories from the well-known $SU(5)$, $SO(10)$ and $SU(4)_\C \times SU(2)_\L \times SU(2)_\R$ models which they generalize. Firstly, Standard Model quarks and leptons are accompanied by and mix with heavy $SU(2)_\L \times SU(2)_\R$ singlet partners. The resulting fermion mass matrices are seesaw in form. Discrete parity symmetries render the determinants of these mass matrices real and eliminate CP violating gauge terms. The unified seesaw models consequently provide a possible resolution to the strong CP problem. Secondly, $\sinsq$ at the unification scale is numerically smaller than the experimentally measured $Z$ scale value. The weak angle must therefore increase as it evolves down in energy. Finally, proton decay is suppressed by small seesaw mixing factors in all these theories. "
"Some aspects of the phenomenology of the top quark and the charged Higgs are studied, emphasizing relations due to radiative corrections. Production mechanisms at the SSC are mentioned, and decay modes are analyzed including radiative corrections to the charged Higgs mass and couplings. The constraints due to the decay b-> s \gamma are discussed. Calculations are performed in the context of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model. "
We apply Heavy Quark Effective Theory to the production of $0^-$ and $1^-$ $Q\bar{q}$ states in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation. We show that HQET implies that the electric quadrupole amplitudes vanish and we propose tests for this theory. We also show how HQET can be applied to distinguish the $^3D_1$ and $^3S_1$ $Q\bar{Q}$ states. 
"A class of generalized Taub-NUT gravitational instantons is reported in five - dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to a non-linear sigma model. The geodesic dynamics of a spinless particle of unit mass on these static gravitational instantons is studied. This is accomplished by finding a generalized Runge-Lenz vector. Unlike the Kepler problem, or, the dynamics of a spinless particle on the familiar Taub-NUT gravitational instantons, the orbits are not conic sections. "
"Existence of maximal hypersurfaces and of foliations by maximal hypersurfaces is proven in two classes of asymptotically flat spacetimes which possess a one parameter group of isometries whose orbits are timelike ``near infinity''. The first class consists of strongly causal asymptotically flat spacetimes which contain no ``black hole or white hole"" (but may contain ``ergoregions"" where the Killing orbits fail to be timelike). The second class of spacetimes possess a black hole and a white hole, with the black and white hole horizons intersecting in a compact 2-surface $S$. "
"Let $X$ be a hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\Bbb P^n$ and $F_X$ be the scheme of $\Bbb P^r$'s contained in $X$. If $X$ is generic, then $F_X$ will have the expected dimension (or empty) and its class in the Chow ring of $G(r+1,n+1)$ is given by the top Chern class of the vector bundle $S^dU^*$, where $U$ is the universal subbundle on the Grassmannian $G(r+1,n+1)$. When we deform a generic $X$ into a degenerate $X_0$, the dimension of $F_X$ can jump. In this case, there is a subscheme $F_{lim}$ of $F_{X_0}$ with the expected dimension which consists of limiting $\Bbb P^r$'s in $X_0$ with respect to a general deformation. The simplest example is the well-known case of $27$ lines in a generic cubic surface. If we degenerate the surface into the union of a plane and a quadric, then there are infinitely many lines in the union. Which $27$ lines are the limiting ones and how many of them are in the plane and how many of them are in the quadric? The goal of this paper is to study $F_{lim}$ in general. "
"We derive strong contraints on the Yukawa couplings and the vacuum expectation value in the singlet majoron model, taking into account the possibility of a small gravitationally induced mass for the majoron. If the present baryon asymmetry was created earlier than at the electroweak phase transition, then to preserve it from the combined effects of lepton number violating interactions and electroweak sphalerons, we find that stringent constraints on the Yukawa couplings, $h < 10^{-7}$, and the majoron scale, $v_s < v_{EW}$, must be satisfied. We also carefully rederive baryogenesis bounds on neutrino masses, finding that in general they apply not to the masses themselves, but only to related parameters, and they are numerically somewhat less stringent than has previously been claimed. "
The free energy of the supersymmetric $t-J$ model is expressed in terms of finite temperature excitations above thermodynamic equilibrium. This reveals that the free energy has the form of noninteracting fermions with temperature dependant excitation spectra. We also discuss the ground state and zero temperature excitations. 
It is suggested that the nonorthodox model of a quasar as a neutrino ball described in terms of the standard model extended by adding right-handed neutrinos and the Majorana scalar field can be presented in order to explain a quasar as a body of weak interacting neutrinos. Neutrino interaction with the scalar Majorana field violates the lepton number and produces the mass splitting of the neutrino due to the sea-saw mechanism. In this model a quasar is an object which appears in the result of the first order cosmological phase transition. In this interpretation a quasar may be regarded as a ball filled with Dirac neutrinos and can be treated as a remnant of phase transition with unbroken global lepton symmetry. In this paper we study the macroscopic parameters of such a configuration. In the result the mass-radius curve M(R) for the quasar is obtained. 
"We show how observations of the density perturbation (scalar) spectrum and the gravitational wave (tensor) spectrum allow a reconstruction of the potential responsible for cosmological inflation. A complete functional reconstruction or a perturbative approximation about a single scale are possible; the suitability of each approach depends on the data available. Consistency equations between the scalar and tensor spectra are derived, which provide a powerful signal of inflation. "
"A comparison between single-cluster and single-spin algorithms is made for the Ising model in 2 and 3 dimensions. We compare the amount of computer time needed to achieve a given level of statistical accuracy, rather than the speed in terms of site updates per second or the dynamical critical exponents. Our main result is that the cluster algorithms become more efficient when the system size, $L^d$, exceeds, $L\sim 70$--$300$ for $d=2$ and $L\sim 80$--$200$ for $d=3$. The exact value of the crossover is dependent upon the computer being used. The lower end of the crossover range is typical of workstations while the higher end is typical of vector computers. Hence, even for workstations, the system sizes needed for efficient use of the cluster algorithm is relatively large. "
"The F0 V star 9 Aur A exhibits an irregular variability of amplitude $\approx $0.1 magnitude at optical wavelengths. The variations are too slow for it to be a $\delta$ Scuti-type star. There is no evidence for a close, interacting companion or ring of dust, either from infrared, ultraviolet, or speckle data. The photometric variability of 9 Aur A is similar to two other early F dwarf stars: $\gamma$ Doradus and HD 96008. 9 Aur B appears to be an M dwarf, 9 Aur C is an early- to mid-K dwarf star, and 9 Aur E, if it is a member of the system, probably is a normal white dwarf. 9 Aur D is most likely an unrelated and distant K giant. [See note added in press regarding a fourth member of this class of ``variables without a cause"", and short term variations of the radial velocity of 9 Aur.] "
We construct an $SO(10)$ grand unified theory in the formulation of non-com-\break mutative geometry. The geometry of space-time is that of a product of a continuos four dimensional manifold times a discrete set of points. The properties of the fermionic sector fix almost uniquely the Higgs structure. The simplest model corresponds to the case where the discrete set consists of three points and the Higgs fields are ${\u {16}_s}\times \overline{\u {16}}_s$ and ${\u {16}_s}\times {\u {16}_s} $. The requirement that the scalar potential for all the Higgs fields not vanish imposes strong restrictions on the vacuum expectation values of the Higgs fields and thus the fermion masses. We show that it is possible to remove these constraints by extending the number of discrete points and adding a singlet fermion and a ${\u {16}_s}$ Higgs field. Both models are studied in detail. 
Newtonian dynamical systems accepting the normal shift on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold are considered. Partial differential equations forming the weak and additional normality conditions for them are reported. 
In this short note we extend the results of Alfaro and Damgaard on the origin of antifields to theories with a gauge algebra that is open or reducible. 
Lecture given Thursday 22 October 1992 at a Mathematics-Computer Science Colloquium at the University of New Mexico. The lecture was videotaped; this is an edited transcript. 
"The conjecture that $N=2$ minimal models in two dimensions are critical points of a super-renormalizable Landau-Ginzburg model can be tested by computing the path integral of the Landau-Ginzburg model with certain twisted boundary conditions. This leads to simple expressions for certain characters of the $N=2$ models which can be verified at least at low levels. An $N=2$ superconformal algebra can in fact be found directly in the {\it noncritical} Landau-Ginzburg system, giving further support for the conjecture. "
"One possible fate of information lost to black holes is its preservation in black hole remnants. It is argued that a type of effective field theory describes such remnants (generically referred to as informons). The general structure of such a theory is investigated and the infinite pair production problem is revisited. A toy model for remnants clarifies some of the basic issues; in particular, infinite remnant production is not suppressed simply by the large internal volumes as proposed in cornucopion scenarios. Criteria for avoiding infinite production are stated in terms of couplings in the effective theory. Such instabilities remain a problem barring what would be described in that theory as a strong coupling conspiracy. The relation to euclidean calculations of cornucopion production is sketched, and potential flaws in that analysis are outlined. However, it is quite plausible that pair production of ordinary black holes (e.g. Reissner Nordstrom or others) is suppressed due to strong effective couplings. It also remains an open possibility that a microscopic dynamics can be found yielding an appropriate strongly coupled effective theory of neutral informons without infinite pair production. "
"We investigate the statistics of the number $N(R,S)$ of lattice points, $n\in \Z^2$, in a ``random'' annular domain $\Pi(R,w)=\,(R+w)A\,\setminus RA$, where $R,w >0$. Here $A$ is a fixed convex set with smooth boundary and $w$ is chosen so that the area of $\Pi (R,w)$ is $S$. The randomness comes from $R$ being taken as random ( with a smooth denisity ) in some interval $[c_1T,c_2T]$, $c_2>c_1>0$. We find that in the limit $T\to\infty $ the variance and distribution of $\De N=N(R;S)-S$ depends strongly on how $S$ grows with $T$. There is a saturation regime $S/T\to\infty$, as $T\to\infty$ in which the fluctuations in $\Delta N$ coming from the two boundaries of $\Pi $, are independent. Then there is a scaling regime, $S/T\to z$, $0<z<\infty $ in which the distribution depends on $z$ in an almost periodic way going to a Gaussian as $z\to\ 0$. The variance in this limit approaches $z$ for ``generic'' $A$ but can be larger for ``degenerate'' cases. The former behavior is what one would expect from the Poisson limit of a distribution for annuli of finite area. "
A four dimensional generally covariant field theory is presented which describes non-dynamical three geometries coupled to scalar fields. The theory has an infinite number of physical observables (or constants of the motion) which are constructed from loops made from scalar field configurations. The Poisson algebra of these observables is closed and is the same as that for the 3+1 gravity loop variables in the Ashtekar formalism. The theory also has observables that give the areas of open surfaces and the volumes of finite regions. Solutions to all the Hamilton-Jacobi equations for the theory and the Dirac quantization conditions in the coordinate representation are given. These solutions are holonomies based on matter loops. A brief discussion of the loop space representation for the quantum theory is also given together with some implications for the quantization of 3+1 gravity. 
"The spin asymmetry parameter $A_\tau$ characterizing the angular distribution of the total hadron momentum in the decay of a polarized tau can be calculated rigorously using perturbative QCD and the operator product expansion. Perturbative QCD corrections to the free quark result $A_\tau = 1/3$ can be expressed as a power series in $\alpha_s(M_\tau)$ and nonperturbative QCD corrections can be expanded systematically in powers of $1/M_\tau^2$. The QCD prediction is $A_\tau = 0.41 \pm 0.02$. In the decay of a high energy tau into hadrons, the value of the hadronic energy distribution $dR_\tau/dz$ evaluated at the maximum hadronic energy fraction $z = 1$ can also be calculated rigorously from QCD. "
"Resonant tunneling between fractional quantum Hall edge states is studied in the Luttinger liquid picture. For the Laughlin parent states, the resonance line shape is a universal function whose width scales to zero at zero temperature. Extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations are presented for $\nu = 1/3$ which confirm this picture and provide a parameter-free prediction for the line shape. "
"We consider the gauging of $ SL(2,R) $ WZNW model by its nilpotent subgroup E(1). The resulting space-time of the corresponding sigma model is seen to collapse to a one dimensional field theory of Liouville. Gauging the diagonal subgroup $ E(1) \times U(1) $ of $SL(2,R) \times U(1)$ theory yields an extremal three dimensional black string. We show that these solutions are obtained from the two dimensional black hole of Witten and the three dimensional black string of Horne and Horowitz by boosting the gauge group. "
"(WORDS: QUANTUM DOTS, COLLECTIVE TRANSPORT, PHYSICAL EXAMPLE OF KPZ) Collective charge transport is studied in one- and two-dimensional arrays of small normal-metal dots separated by tunnel barriers. At temperatures well below the charging energy of a dot, disorder leads to a threshold for conduction which grows linearly with the size of the array. For short-ranged interactions, one of the correlation length exponents near threshold is found from a novel argument based on interface growth. The dynamical exponent for the current above threshold is also predicted analytically, and the requirements for its experimental observation are described. "
"The spectral function of pions interacting with a gas of nucleons and Delta-33-resonances is investigated using the formalism of Thermo Field Dynamics. After a discussion of the zero Delta-width approximation at finite temperature, we take into account a constant width of the resonance. Apart from a full numerical calculation, we give analytical approximations to the pionic spectral function including such a width. They are found to be different from previous approximations, and require an increase of the effective Delta-width in hot compressed nuclear matter. The results are summarized in an effective dispersion relation for interacting pions. "
"The functional determinant of an elliptic operator with positive, discrete spectrum may be defined as $e^{-Z'(0)}$, where $Z(s)$, the zeta function, is the sum $\sum_n^{\infty} \lambda_n^{-s}$ analytically continued to $s$ around the origin. In this paper $Z'(0)$ is calculated for the Laplace operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions inside polygons and simplices with the topology of a disc in the Euclidean plane. The domains we consider are hence piece--wise flat with corners on the boundary and in the interior. Our results are complementary to earlier investigations of the determinants on smooth surfaces with smooth boundaries. We have explicit closed integrated expressions for triangles and regular polygons. "
"This is a review of the aspirations and disappointments of the canonical quantization of geometry. I compare the two chief ways of looking at canonical gravity, geometrodynamics and connection dynamics. I capture as much of the classical theory as I can by pictorial visualization. Algebraic aspects dominate my description of the quantization program. I address the problem of observables. The reader is encouraged to follow the broad outlines and not worry about the technical details. "
"The ratios ${\cal R}_{\gamma ,\ell}=B(Z\to\ell^+\ell^-)\cdot\sigma(Z\gamma) /\allowbreak B(W\to\ell\nu)\cdot\sigma(W^\pm\gamma)$, ${\cal R}_{\gamma , \nu}= B(Z\to\bar\nu\nu)\cdot\sigma(Z\gamma)/\allowbreak B(W\to\ell\nu)\cdot\sigma(W^ \pm\gamma)$, ${\cal R}_{W\gamma}=\sigma(W^\pm\gamma)/\allowbreak\sigma(W^\pm)$, and ${\cal R}_{Z\gamma}=\sigma(Z\gamma)/\allowbreak\sigma(Z)$ are studied as tools to probe the electroweak boson self-interactions. As a function of the minimum photon transverse momentum, ${\cal R}_{\gamma ,\ell}$ and ${\cal R}_{ \gamma ,\nu}$ are found to directly reflect the radiation zero present in $W^ \pm\gamma$ production in the Standard Model. All four ratios are sensitive to anomalous $WW\gamma$ and/or $ZZ\gamma/Z\gamma\gamma$ couplings. The sensitivity of the cross section ratios to the cuts imposed on the final state particles, as well as the systematic uncertainties resulting from different parametrizations of parton distribution functions, the choice of the factorization scale $Q^2$, and from higher order QCD corrections are explored. Taking into account these uncertainties, sensitivity limits for anomalous three gauge boson couplings, based on a measurement of the cross section ratios with an integrated luminosity of 25~pb$^{-1}$ at the Tevatron, are estimated. "
"Starting from a system of planar electrons in a strong magnetic field normal to the plane, interacting with perturbing electromagnetic fields, an effective Lagrangian for the fermions in the lowest Landau level (L.L.L.) has been derived. By choosing a suitable background electrostatic potential, an incompressible droplet of these electrons is constructed. The gauge invariant effective Lagrangian for the electrons in the L.L.L. is shown to split naturally into a $1+1$ dimensional Lagrangian for the electrons on the surface of the droplet and into a $2+1$ dimensional gauge-field Lagrangian representing the contribution of the interior of the droplet. Upon bosonization, the former represents the surface vibrations of the droplet. Individually neither of these two actions is gauge invariant, but it is shown that the gauge dependence from the two pieces cancels out. This demonstrates that the edge degrees of freedom are essential for maintaining gauge invariance. "
"Effective Lagrangians, including those that are spontaneously broken, contain redundant terms. It is shown that the classical equations of motion may be used to simplify the effective Lagrangian, even when quantum loops are to be considered. "
"The critical phenomenon of the zero temperature superfluid--Bose-glass phase transition for hard-core bosons on a three-dimensional disordered lattice is studied using a quantum real-space renormalization-group method. The correlation-length exponent $\nu$ and the dynamic exponent z are computed. The critical exponent z is found to be 2.5 for compressible states and 1.3 for incompressible states. The exponent $\nu$ is shown to be insensitive to z as that in the two-dimensional case, and has value roughly equal to 1. "
The causal boundary of string propagation -- defined as the hypersurface in loop space bordering the timelike(spacelike) domains in which two successive measurements of the string field do(do not) interfere with one another -- is argued to be $0=\int d\sigma\bigl(\delta X(\sigma)\bigr)^2 = \sum_{\ell=-\infty}^\infty \delta x^\mu_{-\ell}\delta x_{\mu \ell}.$ Some possible consequences are discussed. 
We find the quantum analogues of Carlini-Mijic wormholes and consider their application to the cosmological constant problem. In a simple model with $\Lambda$ only we differ with the results of Strominger. 
"We examine the computation of the nucleation barrier used in the expression for false vacuum decay rates in finite temperature field theory. By a detailed analysis of the determinantal prefactor, we show that the correct bounce solution used in the computation of the nucleation barrier should not include loop corrections coming from the scalar field undergoing decay. Temperature corrections to the bounce appear from loop contributions from other fields coupled to the scalar field. We compute the nucleation barrier for a model of scalar fields coupled to fermions, and compare our results to the expression commonly used in the literature. We find that, for large enough self-couplings, the inclusion of scalar loops in the expression of the nucleation barrier leads to an underestimate of the decay rate in the neighborhood of the critical temperature. "
We bosonize the low energy excitations of Fermi Liquids in any number of dimensions in the limit of long wavelengths. The bosons are coherent superposition of electron-hole pairs and are related with the displacement of the Fermi Surface in some arbitrary direction. A coherent-state path integral for the bosonized theory is derived and it is shown to represent histories of the shape of the Fermi Surface. The Landau equation for the sound waves is shown to be exact in the semiclassical approximation for the bosons. 
"Property of charged fermion states is investigated in the quenched U(1) chiral Wilson-Yukawa model. Fitting the charged fermion propagator with a single hyperbolic cosine does not yield reliable results. On the other hand the behavior of the propagator including large lattice size dependence is well described by the large Wilson-Yukawa coupling expansion, providing strong evidence that no charged fermion state exists as an asymptotic particle in this model. "
"We compute the approximate cross section $\sigma_n^{(0)}$ for producing $n-2$ {\it resolved} gluons in a gluon-gluon collision, using the Parke-Taylor formula regularized in a Lorentz invariant manner. We find, in double leading logarithm approximation, that \[ \sigma_{n}^{(0)} \approx \frac{1}{s} \left( \frac{N_c\alpha_s}{2 \pi \sqrt{12}} \ \ln^{2} (s/s_{cut})\right)^{n-2}\ \ , \] where $\sqrt{s_{cut}}$ is the minimum invariant mass for a resolved gluon pair. There is no factor of $1/(n-2)!$ multiplying the expression. We present additional numerical results, and comment on their implications for perturbative calculations of $n$-jet cross sections at colliders. "
"We consider the dependence of collective flow on the nuclear surface thickness in a Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck transport model of heavy ion collisions. Well defined surfaces are introduced by giving test particles a Gaussian density profile of constant width. Zeros of the flow excitation function are as much influenced by the surface thickness as the nuclear equation of state, and the dependence of this effect is understood in terms of a simple potential scattering model. Realistic calculations must also take into account medium effects for the nucleon--nucleon cross section, and impact parameter averaging. We find that balance energy scales with the mass number as $A^{-y}$, where $y$ has a numerical value between 0.35 and 0.5, depending on the assumptions about the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section. "
"A general class of hopping models on a finite bipartite lattice is considered, including the Hubbard model and the Falicov-Kimball model. For the half-filled band, the single-particle density matrix $\uprho (x,y)$ in the ground state and in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles is shown to be constant on the diagonal $x=y$, and to vanish if $x \not=y$ and if $x$ and $y$ are on the same sublattice. For free electron hopping models, it is shown in addition that there are no correlations between sites of the same sublattice in any higher order density matrix. Physical implications are discussed. "
A hard-core disordered boson system is mapped onto a quantum spin 1/2 XY-model with transverse random fields. It is then generalized to a system of spins with an arbitrary magnitude S and studied through a 1/S expansion. The first order 1/S expansion corresponds to a spin-wave theory. The effect of weak disorder is studied perturbatively within such a first order 1/S scheme. We compute the reduction of the speed of sound and the life time of the Bloch phonons in the regime of weak disorder. Generalizations of the present study to the strong disordered regime are discussed. 
"Standard decoupling of heavy fermions may fail when there are non-perturbative variations in a scalar field which gives masses to the fermions. One situation of phenomenological relevance is the case of sphalerons in the presence of fermions at finite temperatures. The free energy of a simple model is determined using a non-perturbative technique to study the effect of fermions on the scalar field. The effects of quantum and thermal fermionic fluctuations on the free energy of the thermal sphaleron are calculated, including contributions from the gradients of the scalar field to all orders. "
"For thermal systems, standard perturbation theory breaks down because of the absence of stable, observable asymptotic states. We show, how the introduction of {\it statistical} quasi-particles (stable, but not observable) gives rise to a consistent description. Statistical and spectral information can be cleanly separated also for interacting systems. "
Supersymmetry transformations are a kind of square root of spacetime translations. The corresponding Lie superalgebra always contains the supertranslation operator $ \delta = c^{\alpha} \sigma^{\mu}_{\alpha \dot \beta} {\overline c}^{\dot \beta} (\epsilon^{\mu})^{\dag} $. We find that the cohomology of this operator depends on a spin-orbit coupling in an SU(2) group and has a quite complicated structure. This spin-orbit type coupling will turn out to be basic in the cohomology of supersymmetric field theories in general. 
"The electron momentum distribution function in the $t-J$ model is studied in the framework of slave particle approach. Within the decoupling scheme used in the gauge field and related theories, we treat formally phase and amplitude fluctuations as well as constraints without further approximations. Our result indicates that the electron Fermi surface observed in the high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission and inverse photoemission experiments cannot be explained within this framework, and the sum rule for the physical electron is not obeyed. A correct scaling behavior of the electron momentum distribution function near $k \sim k_{F}$ and $k \sim 3k_{F}$ in one dimension can be reproduced by considering the nonlocal string fields [Z. Y. Weng et al., Phys. Rev. B45, 7850 (1992)], but the overall momentum distribution is still not correct, at least at the mean field level. "
"By employing the dictum that axiomatic principles are devoid of predictive power, we find that the elastic unitarity constraint, applied to strong W$_L$W$_L$ scattering, does not alter the assumed spectrum of intermediate states. We consider intermediate states involving a heavy Higgs and heavy fermions of a hypothetical fourth generation doublet. In contrast to recent studies, we find no p-wave resonance, and therefore no violation of the S parameter upper bound. We conclude that the elastic unitarity constraint sheds no light on the existence of a heavy fourth generation. "
"This paper has been heavily revised, the final results now being contained in hep-ph/9311202 and hep-ph/9311203. "
"We investigate one-particle semi-inclusive processes in lepton-hadron scattering. In unpolarized scattering order $Q^{-1}$ corrections appear only when transverse momenta are detected. We consider the twist two and three matrix elements and calculate the semi-inclusive structure functions in terms of quark correlation functions. We find that at twist three level not only the standard quark distribution and fragmentation function contribute, but also two new transverse ""profile functions"". We demonstrate explicit gauge invariance of the hadronic tensor at the twist three level. The results of our approach are used to calculate expressions for some cross sections for semi-inclusive processes. "
We study a hybrid chiral model for the nucleon based on the linear sigma model with explicit quarks. We solve the model using a Fock-space configuration consisting of three quarks plus three quarks and a pion as the ground state ansatz in place of the ``hedgehog'' ansatz. We minimize the expectation value of the chiral hamiltonian in this ground state configuration and solve the resulting equations for nucleon quantum numbers. We calculate the canonical set of nucleon observables and compare with previous work. 
"We examine the dynamics of a free massless scalar field on a figure eight network. Upon requiring the scalar field to have a well defined value at the junction of the network, it is seen that the conserved currents of the theory satisfy Kirchhoff's law, that is that the current flowing into the junction equals the current flowing out. We obtain the corresponding current algebra and show that, unlike on a circle, the left- and right-moving currents on the figure eight do not in general commute in quantum theory. Since a free scalar field theory on a one dimensional spatial manifold exhibits conformal symmetry, it is natural to ask whether an analogous symmetry can be defined for the figure eight. We find that, unlike in the case of a manifold, the action plus boundary conditions for the network are not invariant under separate conformal transformations associated with left- and right-movers. Instead, the system is, at best, invariant under only a single set of transformations. Its conserved current is also found to satisfy Kirchhoff's law at the junction. We obtain the associated conserved charges, and show that they generate a Virasoro algebra. Its conformal anomaly (central charge) is computed for special values of the parameters characterizing the network. "
We report on a study of interaction effects in the tunneling density-of-states of a disordered two-dimensional electron gas in the strong magnetic field limit where only the lowest Landau level is occupied. Interactions in the presence of disorder are accounted for by performing finite-size self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations. We find evidence for the formation of a pseudo-gap with a tunneling density-of-states which vanishes at the Fermi energy. 
"Sparticle production and detection at HERA are studied within the recently proposed no-scale flipped $SU(5)$ supergravity model. Among the various reaction channels that could lead to sparticle production at HERA, only the following are within its limit of sensitivity in this model: $e^-p\to \tilde e^-_{L,R}\chi^0_i+X, \tilde \nu_e\chi^-_1+X$, where $\chi^0_i(i=1,2)$ are the two lightest neutralinos and $\chi^-_1$ is the lightest chargino. We study the elastic and deep-inelastic contributions to the cross sections using the Weizs\""acker-Williams approximation. We find that the most promising supersymmetric production channel is right-handed selectron ($\tilde e_{R}$) plus first neutralino ($\chi^0_1$), with one hard electron and missing energy signature. The $\tilde\nu_e\chi^-_1$ channel leads to comparable rates but also allows jet final states. A right-handedly polarized electron beam at HERA would shut off the latter channel and allow preferentially the former one. With an integrated luminosity of ${\cal L}=100\ipb$, HERA can extend the present LEPI lower bounds on $m_{\tilde e_R}, m_{\tilde\nu_e},m_{\chi^0_1}$ by $\approx25\GeV$, while ${\cal L}=1000\ipb$ will make HERA competitive with LEPII. We also show that the Leading Proton Spectrometer (LPS) at HERA is an excellent supersymmetry detector which can provide indirect information about the sparticle masses by measuring the leading proton longitudinal momentum distribution.

"A class of two-dimensional topological conformal field theories (TCFTs) is studied within the framework of gauged WZW models in order to gain some insights on the global geometrical nature of TCFTs. The BRST quantizations of topological G/H gauged WZW models (the twisted versions of SUSY gauged WZW models) are given under fixed back-ground gauge fields. The BRST-cohomology of the system is investigated and the correlation functions among these physical observables are considered under the instanton back-grounds. As a consequence, two-dimensional BF gauge theoretical aspects of TCFTs are revealed. Especially it is shown that two correlation functions under the different instanton back-grounds can change to each other. This process of transmutation is described by the spectral flow. The flow is formulated as a ""singular"" gauge transformation which creates an appropriate back-ground charge on the physical vacuum of the system. The field identification problem of the system is also discussed from the above point of view. "
"After reviewing the role of phase in quantum mechanics, I discuss, with the aid of a number of unpublished documents, the development of quantum phase operators in the 1960's. Interwoven in the discussion are the critical physics questions of the field: Are there (unique) quantum phase operators and are there quantum systems which can determine their nature? I conclude with a critique of recent proposals which have shed new light on the problem. "
"We present the distribution of virial masses for nearby galaxy clusters, as obtained from a data-set of 75 clusters, each having at least 20 galaxy members with measured redshifts within 1 Abell radius. After having accounted for problems of incompleteness of the data-set, we fitted a power-law to the cluster mass distribution. "
"A revised and complete list of the electroweak chiral lagrangian operators up to dimension-four is provided. The connection of these operators to the $S$, $T$ and $U$ parameters and the parameters describing the triple gauge boson vertices $WW\gamma$ and $WWZ$ is made, and the size of these parameters from new heavy physics is estimated using a one flavor-doublet model of heavy fermions. The coefficients of the chiral lagrangian operators are also computed in this model. "
"We discuss the phenomenology of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons, emphasizing those which do not carry manifest flavor quantum numbers. Many of the properties of these mesons are still not fully understood. Some of them probably do not have the usual two-quark (quark-antiquark) structure, but may be mixed with glueball states or other exotics. %, hybrids, or four-quark states. We construct or discuss simple models for these mesons and point out which measurements can shed light on their composition. "
"An idealized multigrid algorithm for the computation of propagators of staggered fermions is investigated. Exemplified in four-dimensional $SU(2)$ gauge fields, it is shown that the idealized algorithm preserves criticality under coarsening. The same is not true when the coarse grid operator is defined by the Galerkin prescription. Relaxation times in computations of propagators are small, and critical slowing is strongly reduced (or eliminated) in the idealized algorithm. Unfortunately, this algorithm is not practical for production runs, but the investigations presented here answer important questions of principle. "
"We consider a class of Calabi-Yau compactifications which are constructed as a complete intersection in weighted projective space. For manifolds with one K\""ahler modulus we construct the mirror manifolds and calculate the instanton sum. "
"The meaning and the extraction of heavy quark masses are discussed. A simple production model is presented which incorporates the running of the heavy quark mass into perturbative calculations. The model offers the possibilities of (i) understanding the differing charmed mass values extracted from different experiments, (ii) determining the short--distance mass relevent to quark mass matrix and mixing angle studies, and (iii) determining the long--distance charm mass, which determines the charm quark threshold and sensitively affects the extraction of $\sin^2\theta_w $. Threshold and forward angle production offer the best possibilities to test the model and extract meaningful charm/bottom masses. "
"A new model of bosonic strings is considered. An action of the model is the sum of the standard string action and a term describing an interaction of a metric with a linear (affine) connection. The Lagrangian of this interaction is an arbitrary analytic function $f(R)$ of the scalar curvature. This is a classically integrable model. The space of classical solutions of the theory consists from sectors with constant curvature. In each sector the equations of motion reduce to the standard string equations and to an additional constant curvature equation for the linear connection. A bifurcation in the space of all Lagrangians takes place. Quantization of the model is briefly discussed. In a quasiclassical approximation one gets the standard string model with a fluctuating cosmological constant. The Lagrangian $f(R)$, like Morse function, governs transitions between manifolds with different topologies. "
"A model of ""hot""-dimer deposition in one dimension, introduced by Pereyra and Albano, is modified to have an unbounded dissociation range. The resulting dynamical equations are solved exactly. A related k-mer dissociation model is also introduced and its solution obtained as a quadrature. "
"Domain walls in equilibrium phase transitions propagate in a preferred direction so as to minimize the free energy of the system. As a result, initial spatio-temporal patterns ultimately decay toward uniform states. The absence of a variational principle far from equilibrium allows the coexistence of domain walls propagating in any direction. As a consequence, *persistent* patterns may emerge. We study this mechanism of pattern formation using a non-variational extension of Landau's model for second order phase transitions. PACS numbers: 05.70.Fh, 42.65.Pc, 47.20.Ky, 82.20Mj "
"It is shown that wave function renormalization can introduce an important contribution to the generation of baryon and lepton number asymmetries by heavy particle decay. These terms, omitted in previous analyses, are of the same order of magnitude as the standard terms. A complete cancellation of leading terms can result in some interesting cases. "
"The discrete states in the $c=1$ string are shown to be the physical states of a certain topological sigma model. We define a set of new fields directly from $c=1$ variables, in terms of which the BRST charge and energy-momentum tensor are rewritten as those of the topological sigma model. Remarkably, ground ring generator $x$ turns out to be a coordinate of the sigma model. All of the discrete states realize a graded ring which contains ground ring as a subset. "
"We rewrite $ N=2$ quantum super $W_{3}$ algebra, a nonlinear extended $N=2$ super Virasoro algebra, containing one additional primary superfield of dimension $2$ which has no $U(1)$ charge, besides the super stress energy tensor of dimension $1$ in $N=2$ superspace. The free superfield realization of this algebra is obtained by two $N=2$ chiral fermionic superfields of dimension $1/2$ satisfying $N=2$ complex $ U(1)$ Kac-Moody algebras. "
"Starting from superdifferential operators in an $N=1$ superfield formulation, we present a systematic prescription for the derivation of classical $N=1$ and $N=2$ super W-algebras by imposing a zero-curvature condition on the connection of the corresponding first order system. We illustrate the procedure on the first non-trivial example (beyond the $N=1$ superconformal algebra) and also comment on the relation with the Gelfand-Dickey construction of $W$-algebras. "
We derive the braid relations of the charged anyons interacting with a magnetic field on Riemann surfaces. The braid relations are used to calculate the quasiparticle's spin in the fractional quantum Hall states on Riemann surfaces. The quasiparticle's spin is found to be topological independent and satisfies physical restrictions. 
"We study a two-band Hubbard model in the limit of infinite dimensions, using a combination of analytical methods and Monte-Carlo techniques. The normal state is found to display various metal to insulators transitions as a function of doping and interaction strength. We derive self-consistent equations for the local Green's functions in the presence of superconducting long-range order, and extend previous algorithms to this case. We present direct numerical evidence that in a specific range of parameter space, the normal state is unstable against a superconducting state characterized by a strongly frequency dependent order-parameter. "
"Following an idea close to one given by C. G. Torre (private communication), we prove that Riemannian spaces (M,g) and (M,h) that are related by a Gurses type (b) transformation [M. Gurses, Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 367 (1993)] or, equivalently, by a Torre-Anderson generalized diffeomorphism [C. G. Torre and I. M. Anderson, Phys. Rev. Lett. xx, xxx (1993)] are neighborhood-isometric, i.e., every point x in M has a corresponding diffeomorphism phi of a neighborhood V of x onto a generally different neighborhood W of x such that phi*(h|W) = g|V. "
"It is shown that gravity on the line can be described by the two dimensional (2D) Hilbert-Einstein Lagrangian supplemented by a kinetic term for the coframe and a translational {\it boundary} term. The resulting model is equivalent to a Yang-Mills theory of local {\it translations} and frozen Lorentz gauge degrees. We will show that this restricted Poincar\'e gauge model in 2 dimensions is completely integrable. {\it Exact} wave, charged black hole, and `dilaton' solutions are then readily found. In vacuum, the integrability of the {\it general} 2D Poincar\'e gauge theory is formally proved along the same line of reasoning. "
"The Heisenberg double of a Hopf algebra may be regarded as a quantum analogue of the cotangent bundle of a Lie group. Quantum duality principle describes relations between a Hopf algebra, its dual, and their Heisenberg double in a way which extends both the theory of coadjoint orbits and the classical Fourier transform. We also describe the twisted Heisenberg double which is relevant for the study of nontrivial deformations of the quantized universal enveloping algebras. "
"This paper contains all known errata in the book ""Galactic Dynamics"". "
"We show that a quantum wire device with spin splitting can work as an active spin polarizer. Hot electrons in one `spin' subband (e.g. `spin-up') may pass such a device with weak electron pair scattering, while electrons in the opposite subband (`spin-down') may have high conversion probability into the `spin-up' subband, resulting in spin polarization of a hot electron beam. Under different circumstances a hot electron beam passing through a single mode quantum wire may induce a steady state magnetization of the background electron gas in a section of the wire weakly coupled to the environment. "
"By carefully studying the (1,0)+(0,1) representation space for massive particles we point to the existence of certain inherent tachyonic dispersion relations: E^2= p^2-m^2. We put forward an interpretation that exploits these ``negative mass squared'' solutions; rotational invariance is spontaneously broken. Relevance of these results to the vortices in the cosmos is pointed out. NOTE: Just as ""negative energy solutions'' of Dirac equation are re-interpreted as antiparticles, similarly the possibility exists for re-interpreting the tachyonic dispersion relations of all (j,0)+(0,j) representation spaces via spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. In Mod. Phys. Lett. A8:2623-2630,1993 we exhibited this explicitly for the j=1 representation space. The interest in this old subject has grown markedly in recent years as is evident from numerous theoretical and phenomenological works on the subject. With this observation, we make this replacement of our paper fourteen years after its initial publication. The Abstract and main text remain unaltered. The title is changed to reflect the underlying physics more closely. "
"This version corrects an inportant typographical error in Eq. 17. COMMENTS, FOR THE RECORD: A referees reoprt from Phys. Rev. Lett. read in part ``The first named author has appreciated my exceptionally long report. He has read and well assimilated the literature I suggested. Congratulations! This very new version of the manuscript has now three authors and carries a very well chosen title. Indeed Bargmann, Wightman and Wigner had studied, this subject forty years ago, in an unpublished book (several chapters were distributed as preprints). The authors explain well the scope of their paper. They have made a thorough construction of a field theory of a non usual Wigner type; that is completely new and all references are relevant. {\it This paper should be published.}"" Despite the fact that no other report was received, the editors of Phys. Rev. Lett. rejected this paper. D.V.A. "
"The global structure of 1 + 1 dimensional compact Universe is studied in two-dimensional model of dilaton gravity. First we give a classical solution corresponding to the spacetime in which a closed time-like curve appears, and show the instability of this spacetime due to the existence of matters. We also observe quantum version of such a spacetime having closed timelike curves never reappear unless the parameters are fine-tuned. "
We describe the mirror of the Z orbifold as a representation of a class of generalized Calabi-Yau manifolds that can be realized as manifolds of dimension five and seven. Despite their dimension these correspond to superconformal theories with $c=9$ and so are perfectly good for compactifying the heterotic string to the four dimensions of space-time. As a check of mirror symmetry we compute the structure of the space of complex structures of the mirror and check that this reproduces the known results for the Yukawa couplings and metric appropriate to the Kahler class parameters on the Z orbifold together with their instanton corrections. 
"We prove that for a stable theory $T,$ if $M$ is a saturated model of $T$ of cardinality $\lambda$ where $\lambda > \big|T\big|,$ then $Aut(M)$ has a dense free subgroup on $2^{\lambda}$ generators. This affirms a conjecture of Hodges. "
"This paper is a survey of computational issues in algebraic geometry, with particular attention to the theory of Grobner bases and the regularity of an algebraic variety. 1. A geometric introduction to Grobner bases. 2. An algebraic introduction to Grobner bases. 3. Bounds in algebraic geometry, and regularity and complexity questions. 4. Applications. "
Let V be the universe of sets and V_{\alpha} the sets of rank \leq\alpha. We develop some axiom schemata for set theory based on the following three assumptions: 1. V \models ZFC 2. V is large with respect to the class of ordinals 3. V is large with respect to each of the V_{\alpha} 
Analytic variational techniques for lattice gauge theories based on the Rayleigh-Ritz(RR) method were previously developed for euclidean SU(2) gauge theories in 3 and 4 dimensions. Their extensions to SU(3) gauge theory including applications to correlation functions and mass gaps are presented here. 
"We study analytically and numerically the decay of a metastable phase in (2+1)-dimensional classical scalar field theory coupled to a heat bath, which is equivalent to two-dimensional Euclidean quantum field theory at zero temperature. By a numerical simulation we obtain the nucleation barrier as a function of the parameters of the potential, and compare it to the theoretical prediction from the bounce (critical bubble) calculation. We find the nucleation barrier to be accurately predicted by theory using the bounce configuration obtained from the tree-level (``classical'') effective action. Within the range of parameters probed, we found that using the bounce derived from the one-loop effective action requires an unnaturally large prefactor to match the lattice results. Deviations from the tree-level prediction are seen in the regime where loop corrections would be expected to become important. "
"In addition to the very good theoretical motivations for supersymmetry, there are now at least nine phenomenological indications that nature is supersymmetric. All are indirect, so more is better. They are enumerated here. Some discussion is also given of models, of when and where superpartners might be directly detected, and of why the scale of supersymmetry cannot be pushed up if superpartners and SUSY Higgs bosons are not directly detected. "
"We propose a new formulation of the $D=3$ type II superstring which is manifestly invariant under both target-space $N=2$ supersymmetry and worldsheet $N=(1,1)$ super reparametrizations. This gives rise to a set of twistor (commuting spinor) variables, which provide a solution to the two Virasoro constraints. The worldsheet supergravity fields are shown to play the r\^ole of auxiliary fields. "
"We propose a new type of approximation to quantum determinants, ``quantum Fredholm determinant"", and conjecture that, compared to the quantum Selberg zeta functions derived from Gutzwiller semiclassical trace formulas, such determinants have a larger domain of analyticity for Axiom A hyperbolic systems. The conjecture is supported by a numerical investigation of the 3-disk repeller. "
"Dynamics of two-Skyrmion systems is studied in the quasistatic approach. The quasistatic approach enables us to formulate the collective coordinate quantization of two-Skyrmion systems consistently with the 1/Nc expansion. By constructing quasistatic field configurations for largely separated two Skyrmions, their energies are computed for three independent relative orientations of the Skyrmions in the isospin space. The obtained energies are much lower than those for the product approximation. In particular, the repulsion in the two-pion range is considerably reduced. "
"We study the pairing within the Peierls-Hubbard Model for electron- and hole-doped analogs of C$_{60}$ accessible to exact diagonalization techniques (cube, truncated tetrahedron, {\it etc.}). We discuss how inclusion of electron-phonon interactions can substantially modify the conclusions about pairing obtained when this coupling is neglected. We also discuss potential pitfalls in the extrapolation from these small system calculations to C$_{60}$, and stress the necessity of having the correct intuitive picture. "
"We study the nonunitary representations of N=2 Super Virasoro algebra for the rational central charges c<3. The resolutions for the irreducible representations of N=2 SVir in terms of the ""2-d gravity modules"" are obtained and their characters are computed. The correspondence between the N=2 nonunitary ""minimal"" models and the Virasoro minimal models coupled to 2-d gravity is shown at the level of states. We also define the hamiltonian reduction of the BRST complex of sl(N)/sl(N) coset to the BRST complex of the W-gravity coupled to the W matter. The case of sl(2) is considered explicitly. It leads to the presentation of N=2 Super Virasoro algebra by the Lie algebra cohomology. Finally, we reveal the mechanism of the correspondence between sl(2)/sl(2)$ coset and 2-d gravity. "
"By attaching basis vectors to the components of matter fields, one may render free action densities fully covariant. Both the connection and the tetrads are quadratic forms in these basis vectors. The metric of spacetime, which is quadratic in the tetrads, is then quartic in the basis vectors. "
"In these lectures I review the standard hot big-bang cosmology, emphasizing its successes, its shortcomings, and its major challenge---a detailed understanding of the formation of structure in the Universe. I then discuss the motivations for---and the fundamentals of---inflationary cosmology, particularly emphasizing the quantum origin of metric (density and gravity-wave) perturbations. Inflation addresses the shortcomings of the standard cosmology and provides the ``initial data'' for structure formation. I conclude by addressing the implications of inflation for structure formation, evaluating the various cold dark matter models in the light of the recent detection of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic background radiation by COBE. In the near term, the study of structure formation offers a powerful probe of inflation, as well as specific inflationary models. "
"I prove the existence of slices for an action of a reductive complex Lie group on a K\""ahler manifold at certain orbits, namely those orbits that intersect the zero level set of a momentum map for the action of a compact real form of the group. I give applications of this result to symplectic reduction and geometric quantization at singular levels of the momentum map. In particular, I obtain a formula for the multiplicities of the irreducible representations occurring in the quantization in terms of symplectic invariants of reduced spaces, generalizing a result of Guillemin and Sternberg. "
"We obtain integral representations for the wave functions of Calogero-type systems,corresponding to the finite-dimentional Lie algebras,using exact evaluation of path integral.We generalize these systems to the case of the Kac-Moody algebras and observe the connection of them with the two dimensional Yang-Mills theory.We point out that Calogero-Moser model and the models of Calogero type like Sutherland one can be obtained either classically by some reduction from two dimensional Yang-Mills theory with appropriate sources or even at quantum level by taking some scaling limit.We investigate large k limit and observe a relation with Generalized Kontsevich Model. "
"We present a study of the stellar content of the open cluster M67. We have computed new evolutionary sequences of stellar models with solar abundance that cover all phases of evolution from the Zero-Age Main Sequence to the bright end of the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). We examine the fit between the calculated and the observed red giant branch (RGB) in particular, and discuss factors that most influence its quality. The distinct color gap between the RGB and the clump giants is compared with the temperature gap between the He-burning tracks and the computed 5 Gyr isochrone. This purely differential approach strongly indicates that the clump giants have M $\lta 0.70\msun\ $, implying an amount of mass loss ($\approx 0.6$ \msun) well in excess of that found in globular cluster stars. Observational constraints on mass loss processes favor the interpretation that mass loss in cool low-mass giant stars increases with metallicity. "
"The CALTECH gamma-transition experiment testing time reversal symmetry via the E2/M1 mulipole mixing ratio of the 122 keV gamma-line in Fe-57 has already been performed in 1977. Extending an earlier analysis in terms of an effective one-body potential, this experiment is now analyzed in terms of effective one boson exchange T-odd P-even nucleon nucleon potentials. Within the model space considered for the Fe-57 nucleus no contribution from isovector rho-type exchange is possible. The bound on the coupling strength phi_A from effective short range axial-vector type exchange induced by the experimental bound on sin(eta) leads to phi_A < 10^{-2}. "
"We measured the first azimuthal distributions of triple--differential cross sections of neutrons emitted in heavy-ion collisions, and compared their maximum azimuthal anisotropy ratios with Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (BUU) calculations with a momentum-dependent interaction. The BUU calculations agree with the triple- and double-differential cross sections for positive rapidity neutrons emitted at polar angles from 7 to 27 degrees; however, the maximum azimuthal anisotropy ratio for these free neutrons is insensitive to the size of the nuclear incompressibility modulus K characterizing the nuclear matter equation of state. "
"We discuss the relation of the two types of sums in the Rogers-Schur-Ramanujan identities with the Bose-Fermi correspondence of massless quantum field theory in $1+1$ dimensions. One type, which generalizes to sums which appear in the Weyl-Kac character formula for representations of affine Lie algebras and in expressions for their branching functions, is related to bosonic descriptions of the spectrum of the field theory (associated with the Feigin-Fuchs construction in conformal field theory). Fermionic descriptions of the same spectrum are obtained via generalizations of the other type of sums. We here summarize recent results for such fermionic sum representations of characters and branching functions. (To appear in C.N. Yang's 70th birthday Festschrift.) "
"Recent progress in the computation of one-loop gluon amplitudes is reviewed. These methods were originally derived from superstring theory and are significantly more efficient than conventional Feynman rules. With these methods, explicit computations can be performed beyond those achieved by traditional methods. "
"Proposed close-encounter solar probes (Vulcan and Solar Probe) are planned to have highly eccentric orbits, with a perihelion of about $4R_S$ and an inclination close to $90^\circ$ out of the plane of the ecliptic. We show this could allow at least an order-of-magnitude improvement in the present directly measured limit on the photon mass. "
The connection between a Taylor series and a continued-fraction involves a nonlinear relation between the Taylor coefficients $\{ a_n \}$ and the continued-fraction coefficients $\{ b_n \}$. In many instances it turns out that this nonlinear relation transforms a complicated sequence $\{a_n \}$ into a very simple one $\{ b_n \}$. We illustrate this simplification in the context of graph combinatorics. 
"We propose a new realization of the chaotic inflationary scenario in which the scalar field responsible for inflation also spontaneously breaks the underlying gauge symmetry at a superheavy scale $\sim 10^{15} - 10^{17}\; GeV$. A possible framework is provided by the superstring inspired gauge models, in which case several predictions are essentially model independent. The spectral index for the scalar perturbations $n \simeq 0.92 - 0.88$, while the ratio of the tensor to the scalar quadrupole anisotropy is $(\Delta T/T)^2_T/(\Delta T/T)^2_S \approx 0.4 - 0.7$. On smaller angular scales, $\delta T/T (1^\circ ) \approx (9 - 16) \times 10^{-6}$ and $\delta T/T (2.1^\circ ) \approx (6 - 10) \times 10^{-6}$. Implications for magnetic monopoles and cosmic strings as well as the gauge hierarchy problem are pointed out. "
"Based on the standard statistical interpretation of mixed quantum states, a unique family of consistent histories has been constructed for the quantum Brownian motion in the Caldeira-Leggett reservoir. Analytic solutions have been shown in the Markovian regime: they are uniquely defined coherent wave packets travelling near classical trajectories. "
"A cubic surface in $P^3$ is known to contain 27 lines, out of which one can form 36 Schlafli double - sixes i.e., collections $l_1,...,l_6, l'_1,..., l'_6\}$ of 12 lines such that each $l_i$ meets only $l'_j, j\neq i$ and does not meet $l_j, j\neq i$. In 1881 F. Schur proved that any double - six gives rise to a certain quadric $Q$ , called Schur quadric which is characterized as follows: for any $i$ the lines $l_i$ and $l'_i$ are orthogonal with respect to (the quadratic form defining) $Q$. The aim of the paper is to relate Schur's construction to the theory of vector bundles on $P^2$ and to generalize this construction along the lines of the said theory. "
"The massless flow between successive minimal models of conformal field theory is related to a flow within the sine-Gordon model when the coefficient of the cosine potential is imaginary. This flow is studied, partly numerically, from three different points of view. First we work out the expansion close to the Kosterlitz-Thouless point, and obtain roaming behavior, with the central charge going up and down in between the UV and IR values of $c=1$. Next we analytically continue the Casimir energy of the massive flow (i.e. with real cosine term). Finally we consider the lattice regularization provided by the O(n) model in which massive and massless flows correspond to high- and low-temperature phases. A detailed discussion of the case $n=0$ is then given using the underlying N=2 supersymmetry, which is spontaneously broken in the low-temperature phase. The ``index'' $\tr F(-1)^F$ follows from the Painleve III differential equation, and is shown to have simple poles in this phase. These poles are interpreted as occuring from level crossing (one-dimensional phase transitions for polymers). As an application, new exact results for the connectivity constants of polymer graphs on cylinders are obtained. "
"We study the spectrum, the massless S-matrices and the ground-state energy of the flows between successive minimal models of conformal field theory, and within the sine-Gordon model with imaginary coefficient of the cosine term (related to the minimal models by ``truncation''). For the minimal models, we find exact S-matrices which describe the scattering of massless kinks, and show using the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz that the resulting non-perturbative c-function (defined by the Casimir energy on a cylinder) flows appropriately between the two theories, as conjectured earlier. For the non-unitary sine-Gordon model, we find unusual behavior. For the range of couplings we can study analytically, the natural S-matrix deduced from the minimal one by ``undoing'' the quantum-group truncation does not reproduce the proper c-function with the TBA. It does, however, describe the correct properties of the model in a magnetic field. "
"We present results of an extensive test program of a group of pseudorandom number generators which are commonly used in the applications of physics, in particular in Monte Carlo simulations. The generators include public domain programs, manufacturer installed routines and a random number sequence produced from physical noise. We start by traditional statistical tests, followed by detailed bit level and visual tests. The computational speed of various algorithms is also scrutinized. Our results allow direct comparisons between the properties of different generators, as well as an assessment of the efficiency of the various test methods. This information provides the best available criterion to choose the best possible generator for a given problem. However, in light of recent problems reported with some of these generators, we also discuss the importance of developing more refined physical tests to find possible correlations not revealed by the present test methods. "
"Cosmological solutions of the beta function equations for the background fields of the closed bosonic string are investigated at the one-loop level. Following recent work of Kostelecky and Perry, it is assumed that the spatial sections of the space-time are conformally flat. Working in the sigma-model frame, the non-trivial tachyon potential is utilized to determine solutions with sufficient inflation to solve the smoothness and flatness problems. The graceful exit and density perturbation constraints can also be successfully implemented. "
"We present an investigation of various gauge invariant definitions of the $q\bar q$ Bethe-Salpeter (BS) amplitude for mesons in lattice QCD, and compare them to the Coulomb and Landau gauge BS amplitudes. We show that the gauge invariant BS amplitude is considerably broadened by the use of ``fat'' gauge links (constructed by smearing the links of the original lattice). A qualitative demonstration of the Lorentz contraction of the pion wavefunction at non-zero momentum is given. We also calculate density-density correlations and discuss the limitations in extracting the charge radius of the pion from these observables. Lastly, the polarization dependence of the BS amplitude for the $\rho$ meson is exhibited, and we extract the relative admixture of $l=0$ and $l=2$ states showing that simple hydrogen-like wavefunctions provide a good fit. "
"We generalize to dimension $p>1$ the notion of string structure and discuss the related obstruction. We apply our results to a model of bosonic $p$-branes propagating on a principal $G$-bundle, coupled to a Yang--Mills field and an antisymmetric tensor field and in the presence of a Wess-Zumino term in the Lagrangian. We construct the quantization line bundle and discuss the action of background gauge transformations on wave functions. "
"Motivated by the problem of background independence of closed string field theory we study geometry on the infinite vector bundle of local fields over the space of conformal field theories (CFT's). With any connection we can associate an excluded domain $D$ for the integral of marginal operators, and an operator one-form $\omega_\mu$. The pair $(D, \omega_\mu)$ determines the covariant derivative of any correlator of local fields. We obtain interesting classes of connections in which $\omega_\mu$'s can be written in terms of CFT data. For these connections we compute their curvatures in terms of four-point correlators, $D$, and $\omega_\mu$. Among these connections three are of particular interest. A flat, metric compatible connection $\HG$, and connections $c$ and $\bar c$ having non-vanishing curvature, with $\bar c$ being metric compatible. The flat connection cannot be used to do parallel transport over a finite distance. Parallel transport with either $c$ or $\bar c$, however, allows us to construct a CFT in the state space of another CFT a finite distance away. The construction is given in the form of perturbation theory manifestly free of divergences. "
"We investigate the dependence of the gauge couplings on the dilaton field in string effective theories at the one--loop level. First we resolve the discrepancies between statements based on symmetry considerations and explicit calculations in string effective theories on this subject. A calculation of the relevant one--loop scattering amplitudes in string theory gives us further information and allows us to derive the exact form of the corresponding effective Lagrangian. In particular there is no dilaton dependent one--loop correction to the holomorphic $f$--function arising from massive string modes in the loop. In addition we address the coupling of the antisymmetric tensor field to the gauge bosons at one--loop. While the string S--matrix elements are not reproduced using the usual supersymmetric Lagrangian with the chiral superfield representation for the dilaton field, the analogue Lagrangian with the dilaton in a linear multiplet naturally gives the correct answer. "
"We analyze the production and detection of the Higgs boson in the next generation of linear $e^+e^-$ colliders operating in the $e\gamma$ mode. In particular, we study the production mechanism $e + \gamma \rightarrow e \gamma \gamma \rightarrow e + H$, where one photon is generated via the laser backscattering mechanism, while the other is radiated via the usual bremsstrahlung process. We show that this is the most important mechanism for Higgs boson production in a $500$ GeV $e\gamma$ collider for $M_H\raisebox{-.4ex}{\rlap{$\sim$}} \raisebox{.4ex}{$>$}140$ GeV. We also study the signals and backgrounds for detection of the Higgs in the different decay channels, $b \bar b$, $W^+W^-$, and $ZZ$, and suggest kinematical cuts to improve the signature of an intermediate mass Higgs boson. "
"If the Universe contains at least one inflationary domain with a sufficiently large and homogeneous scalar field, then this domain permanently produces new inflationary domains of all possible types. We show that under certain conditions this process of the self-reproduction of the Universe can be described by a stationary distribution of probability, which means that the fraction of the physical volume of the Universe in a state with given properties (with given values of fields, with a given density of matter, etc.) does not depend on time. This represents a strong deviation of inflationary cosmology from the standard Big Bang paradigm. "
"The phase transition of the three--dimensional random field Ising model with a discrete ($\pm h$) field distribution is investigated by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Values of the critical exponents for the correlation length, specific heat, susceptibility, disconnected susceptibility and magnetization are determined simultaneously via finite size scaling. While the exponents for the magnetization and disconnected susceptibility are consistent with a first order transition, the specific heat appears to saturate indicating no latent heat. Sample to sample fluctuations of the susceptibilty are consistent with the droplet picture for the transition. "
"The Navier--Stokes equations for incompressible flows past a two--dimensional sphere are considered in this article. The existence of an inertial form of the equations is established. Furthermore for the first time for fluid equations, we derive an upper bound on the dimension of the differential system (inertial manifold) which fully reproduces the infinite dimensional dynamics. This bound is expressed in terms of Grashof Numbers. "
We study the use of effective transfer matrices for the numerical computation of masses (or correlation lengths) in lattice spin models. The effective transfer matrix has a strongly reduced number of components. Its definition is motivated by a renormalization group transformation of the full model onto a 1-dimensional spin model. The matrix elements of the effective transfer matrix can be determined by Monte Carlo simulation. We show that the mass gap can be recovered exactly from the spectrum of the effective transfer matrix. As a first step towards application we performed a Monte Carlo study for the 2-dimensional Ising model. For the simulations in the broken phase we employed a multimagnetical demon algorithm. The results for the tunnelling correlation length are particularly encouraging. 
"Rare kaon processes appear to be particularly suitable to study the extensions of the standard model, especially if the possibility for eventual direct evidence becomes unlikely. In this review, we discuss processes that are important as a test of either the standard model or supergravity. Moreover, some of these are important even for both the standard model and for supergravity. Particular attention is paid to the reduction of uncertainties in the calculation, especially the ones coming from the confinement effects. Recent approaches, such as chiral perturbation theory, the large $N_c$-expansion, QCD sum rules and lattice QCD, are discussed. This is found to be the best strategy in view of the fact that supersymmetric effects are rather tiny. "
"The main goal of this paper is to prove that if the energy-momentum (or energy-Casimir) method predicts formal instability of a relative equilibrium in a Hamiltonian system with symmetry, then with the addition of dissipation, the relative equilibrium becomes spectrally and hence linearly and nonlinearly unstable. The energy-momentum method assumes that one is in the context of a mechanical system with a given symmetry group. Our result assumes that the dissipation chosen does not destroy the conservation law associated with the given symmetry group---thus, we consider internal dissipation. This also includes the special case of systems with no symmetry and ordinary equilibria. The theorem is proved by combining the techniques of Chetaev, who proved instability theorems using a special Chetaev-Lyapunov function, with those of Hahn, which enable one to strengthen the Chetaev results from Lyapunov instability to spectral instability. The main achievement is to strengthen Chetaev's methods to the context of the block diagonalization version of the energy momentum method given by Lewis, Marsden, Posbergh, and Simo. However, we also give the eigenvalue movement formulae of Krein, MacKay and others both in general and adapted to the context of the normal form of the linearized equations given by the block diagonal form, as provided by the energy-momentum method. A number of specific examples, such as the rigid body with internal rotors, are provided to illustrate the results. "
"We examine several resummation methods for computing higher order corrections to the finite temperature effective potential, in the context of a scalar $\phi^4$ theory. We show by explicit calculation to four loops that dressing the propagator, not the vertex, of the one-loop tadpole correctly counts ``daisy'' and ``super-daisy'' diagrams. "

"With every smooth, projective algebraic curve $\tilde{C}$ with involution $\sigma :\tilde{C}\longrightarrow \tilde{C}$ without fixed points is associated the Prym data which consists of the Prym variety $P:=(1-\sigma )J(\tilde{C})$ with principal polarization $\Xi$ such that $2\Xi$ is algebraically equivalent to the restriction on $P$ of the canonical polarization $\Theta $ of the Jacobian $J(\tilde{C})$. In contrast to the classical Torelli theorem the Prym data does not always determine uniquely the pair $(\tilde{C},\sigma )$ up to isomorphism. In this paper we introduce an extension of the Prym data as follows. We consider all symmetric theta divisors $\Theta $ of $J(\tilde{C})$ which have even multiplicity at every point of order 2 of $P$. It turns out that they form three $P_2$ orbits. The restrictions on $P$ of the divisors of one of the orbits form the orbit $\{ 2\Xi \} $, where $\Xi $ are the symmetric theta divisors of $P$. The other restrictions form two $P_2$-orbits $O_1,O_2\subset \mid 2\Xi \mid $. The extended Prym data consists of $(P,\Xi )$ together with $O_1,O_2$. We prove that it determines uniquely the pair $(\tilde{C} ,\sigma )$ up to isomorphism provided $g(\tilde{C})\geq 3$. The proof is analogous to Andreotti's proof of Torelli's theorem and uses the Gauss map for the divisors of $O_1,O_2$. The result is an analog in genus $>1$ of a classical theorem for elliptic curves. "
"We study scalar perturbations to a Robertson-Walker cosmological metric in terms of a pseudo-Newtonian potential, which emerges naturally from the solution of the field equations. This potential is given in terms of a Green function for matter density fluctuations of arbitrary amplitude whose time and spatial dependence are assumed known. The results obtained span both the linearized and Newtonian limits, and do not explicitly depend on any kind of averaging procedure, but make the valid assumption that the global expansion rate is that of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model. In addition, we discuss the similarity to diffusive processes in the evolution of the potential, and possible applications. "
We show in section 1 that the Ax-Kochen isomorphism theorem requires the continuum hypothesis. Most of the applications of this theorem are insensitive to set theoretic considerations. (A probable exception is the work of Moloney.) In section 2 we give an unrelated result on cuts in models of Peano arithmetic which answers a question on the ideal structure of countable ultraproducts of Z. In section 1 we also answer a question of Keisler and Schmerl regarding Scott complete ultrapowers of R . 
It is shown that only a narrow class of inflationary models can possibly agree with the available observational data on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). These models may be governed by ``matter'' with the effective equation of state $-1.2 <p/ \epsilon < -0.6$ which includes the De-Sitter case $p/ \epsilon = -1$. 
This paper is a technical continuation of ``Natural Axiom Schemata Extending ZFC. Truth in the Universe?'' In that paper we argue that $CIFS$ is a natural axiom schema for the universe of sets. In particular it is a natural closure condition on $V$ and a natural generalization of $IFS(L).$ Here we shall prove the consistency of $ZFC\ +\ CIFS$ relative to the existence of a transitive model of $ZFC$ using the compactness theorem together with a class forcing. 
"Absract (Invited talk at the X DAE High Energy Physics symposium in December 1992, held at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay) "
"Numerical simulations have become an important tool to understand and predict non-perturbative phenomena in particle physics. In this article we attempt to present a general overview over the field. First, the basic concepts of lattice gauge theories are described, including a discussion of currently used algorithms and the reconstruction of continuum physics from lattice results. We then proceed to present some results for QCD, both at low energies and at high temperatures, as well as for the electro-weak sector of the standard model. "
"The antibracket in BRST theory is known to define a map $\rm{H^p \times H^q \longrightarrow H^{p+q+1}}$ associating with two equivalence classes of BRST invariant observables of respective ghost number p and q an equivalence class of BRST invariant observables of ghost number p+q+1. It is shown that this map is trivial in the space of all functionals, i.e., that its image contains only the zeroth class. However it is generically non trivial in the space of local functionals. Implications of this result for the problem of consistent interactions among fields with a gauge freedom are then drawn. It is shown that the obstructions to constructing such interactions lie precisely in the image of the antibracket map and are accordingly inexistent if one does not insist on locality. However consistent local interactions are severely constrained. The example of the Chern-Simons theory is considered. It is proved that the only consistent, local, Lorentz covariant interactions for the abelian models are exhausted by the non-abelian Chern-Simons extensions. "
"We continue the investigation of formation of trapped surfaces in strongly curved , conformally flat geometries. Initial data in quasi-polar gauges rather then maximal ones are considered. This implies that apparent horizons coincide with minimal surfaces. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the formation of trapped surfaces are given. These results can be generalized to include the case with gravitational radiation. We found that mass of a body inside a fixed volume is bounded from above if geometry of a Cauchy slice is smooth. "
"MAssive Compact Halo Objects such as brown dwarfs, Jupiters, and black holes are prime candidates to comprise the dark halo of our galaxy. Paczynski noted that objects (dubbed MACHOs) with masses in the range $10^{-6}M_\odot < M \simlt 100 M_\odot$. can be detected via gravitational microlensing of stars in the Magellanic Clouds with the caveat that only about one in $10^6$ stars will be lensed at any given time. Our group has recently begun a search for microlensing using a refurbished 1.27 meter telescope at the Mount Stromlo Observatory in Australia. Since the summer of 1992, we have been imaging up to $10^7$ stars a night in the Large Magellanic Cloud using our large format two-color $3.4\times 10^7$ pixel CCD camera. Here I report on our first results based on an analysis of $\sim 10^6$ of these stars. Although this is not enough data to make definitive statements about the nature of the dark matter, we are able to conclude that the rate of variable star background events is not larger than the expected MACHO signal.

"I consider a Langevin equation with field-dependent kernels and investigate supersymmetry of the stochastic generating functional constructed from the Langevin equation. Moreover I describe the stochastic generating functional in terms of a superfield. In the superfield formalism, it becomes clear that the stochastic quantization method with the field-dependent kernel is equivalent to the path-integral quantization method. "
"This is an expanded and updated version of a talk given at the Conference on Topics in Geometry and Physics at the University of Southern California, November 6, 1992. It is a survey talk, aimed at mathematicians AND physicists, which attempts to bring together the topics in the title without assuming much background in any of them. Closed string field theory leads to a (strong homotopy) generalization of Lie algebra, which is strongly related to the way the moduli spaces $\Cal M_{0,N+1}$ fit together as an ``operad''. The latter in turn plays an important role in the understanding of vertex operator algebras. "
"The structure of $^6$Li, $^7$Li and $^{11}$Li nuclei is investigated in a model space which includes all configurations with oscillator energy up to $3\hbar\omega$ above the ground state configuration. The energy spectra and electromagnetic properties of the low-lying states are determined with various two-body interactions, which are derived from the Bonn potential. The results of these shell-model calculations depend on the strength of the tensor component contained in the NN interaction and also on the treatment of the Dirac spinors for the nucleons in the nuclear medium. In addition the calculation determines the {\it dipole polarizability} of $^7$Li and $^{11}$Li caused from virtual $E1$ excitations to the positive parity states of these nuclei. It is demonstrated that the BAGEL scheme provides a very powerful tool to consider contributions from virtual excitations up to large energies. "
"We consider non-perturbative solutions of the Weinberg-Salam model at finite temperature. We employ an effective temperature-dependent potential yielding a first order phase transition. In the region of the phase transition, there exist two kinds of static, spherically symmetric solutions: sphalerons and bubbles. We analyze these solutions as functions of temperature. We consider the most general spherically symmetric fluctuations about the two solutions and construct the discrete modes in the region of the phase transition. Sphalerons and bubbles both possess a single unstable mode. We present simple approximation formulae for these levels. "
"We study a topological Yang-Mills theory with $N=2$ fermionic symmetry. Our formalism is a field theoretical interpretation of the Donaldson polynomial invariants on compact K\""{a}hler surfaces. We also study an analogous theory on compact oriented Riemann surfaces and briefly discuss a possible application of the Witten's non-Abelian localization formula to the problems in the case of compact K\""{a}hler surfaces. "
"We derive model-independent constraints on Higgs mass and couplings from associated signals for higher masses, accessible at LEP2. This work is motivated by the fact that, in many extensions of the standard model, the Higgs boson can have substantial ""invisible"" decay modes, for example, into light or massless weakly interacting Goldstone bosons associated to the spontaneous violation of lepton number below the weak scale. "
"Various works have suggested that the Bondi--Sachs--Penrose decay conditions on the gravitational field at null infinity are not generally representative of asymptotically flat space--times. We have made a detailed analysis of the constraint equations for ``asymptotically hyperboloidal'' initial data and find that log terms arise generically in asymptotic expansions. These terms are absent in the corresponding Bondi--Sachs--Penrose expansions, and can be related to explicit geometric quantities. We have nevertheless shown that there exists a large class of ``non--generic'' solutions of the constraint equations, the evolution of which leads to space--times satisfying the Bondi--Sachs--Penrose smoothness conditions. "
"We show how to measure cosmological parameters using observations of inspiraling binary neutron star or black hole systems in one or more gravitational wave detectors. To illustrate, we focus on the case of fixed mass binary systems observed in a single Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)-like detector. Using realistic detector noise estimates, we characterize the rate of detections as a function of a threshold signal-to-noise ratio $\rho_0$, the Hubble constant $H_0$, and the binary ``chirp'' mass. For $\rho_0 = 8$, $H_0 = 100$ km/s/Mpc, and $1.4 \msun$ neutron star binaries, the sample has a median redshift of $0.22$. Under the same assumptions but independent of $H_0$, a conservative rate density of coalescing binaries ($8\times10^{-8}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$) implies LIGO will observe $\sim 50\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ binary inspiral events. The precision with which $H_0$ and the deceleration parameter $q_0$ may be determined depends on the number of observed inspirals. For fixed mass binary systems, $\sim 100$ observations with $\rho_0 = 10$ in the LIGO detector will give $H_0$ to 10\% in an Einstein-DeSitter cosmology, and 3000 will give $q_0$ to 20\%. For the conservative rate density of coalescing binaries, 100 detections with $\rho_0 = 10$ will require about 4~yrs. "
"The $SU(3)$-violating decays $\Phi^{2S} \goto \Phi^{1S} X$, where $X = \pi^0$ or $\eta$ and $\Phi = J/\psi$ or $\Upsilon$ have been recently proposed as a means of probing the light quark masses beyond leading order in chiral perturbation theory. We argue that this analysis is incorrect, even in the heavy quark limit. We show that these decays are governed by an infinite number of matrix elements which are not suppressed by any small parameter, and which cannot be computed with our present understanding of QCD. Furthermore, for sufficiently heavy quarks, we show that the decay amplitudes can be organized into a twist expansion, and that the contributions considered in the above proposal are subleading in this expansion. We also explain how these decays nonetheless give a constraint on the light quark masses valid at {\it leading order} in the chiral expansion. The decays $\Phi^{1S} \goto \eta\gamma$ and $\Phi^{2S} \goto \Phi^{1S} \pi\pi$ also have contributions from infinitely many operators, contrary to claims in the literature. "
"In this paper we present a calculation of the $\Delta S=1$ effective weak Hamiltonian including next-to-leading order QCD and QED corrections. At a scale $\mu$ of the order of few GeV, the Wilson coefficients of the operators are given in terms of the renormalization group evolution matrix and of the coefficients computed at a large scale $\sim M_W$. The expression of the evolution matrix is derived from the two-loop anomalous dimension matrix which governs the mixing of the relevant current-current and penguin operators, renormalized in some given regularization scheme. We have computed the anomalous dimension matrix up to and including order $\alphas^2$ and $\alphae \alphas$ in two different renormalization schemes, NDR and HV, with consistent results. We give many details on the calculation of the anomalous dimension matrix at two loops, on the determination of the Wilson coefficients at the scale $M_W$ and of their evolution from $M_W$ to $\mu$. We also discuss the dependence of the Wilson coefficients/operators on the regularization scheme. "
"The one dimensional Fermi gas of matrix eigenvalues of the Marinari-Parisi model at positive values of the cosmological constant is generalised.The number of matrix eigenvalues (i.e. gas particles) is varied while keeping the effective potential fixed. This model exhibits a transition from a phase whose continuum behaviour is that of $c=1$ conformal matter coupled to gravity to the well known pure gravity phase of the original model.The former phase is character- ised by an extremely large Regge slope $\alpha^\prime$ which scales as $\beta^{2/5}$ causing the scaling regions of the two phases to overlap. In this way a continuous flow from one phase to the other is made poss- ible. This phase transition occurs in the singlet sector of the matrix model. The density of states and the two puncture correlator at non zero momenta are calculated on the sphere and are found to behave very differ- ently in the two phases,a fact which demonstrates the phase transition. We comment on a possible relation between this transition and large \alpha^\prime$ semiclassical expansions in the continuum. "
"A semi-classical, many-body atomic model incorporating a momentum-dependent Heisenberg core to stabilize atomic electrons is used to study antiproton capture on Helium. Details of the antiproton collisions leading to eventual capture are presented, including the energy and angular momentum states of incident antiprotons which result in capture via single or double electron ionization, i.e. into [He$^{++}\,\bar p$ or He$^{+}\,\bar p$], and the distribution of energy and angular momentum states following the Auger cascade. These final states are discussed in light of recently reported, anomalously long-lived antiproton states observed in liquid He. "
"The Parke-Taylor multigluon amplitudes are examined in the multi-Regge kinematics, which assumes strong rapidity ordering of the produced gluons, and are used to compute the $n$-gluon production cross section and the gluon-gluon total cross section. "
Products of random transfer matrices are applied to low dimensional disordered systems to evaluate numerically extensive quantities such as entropy and overlap probability distribution. The main advantage is the possibility to avoid numerical differentiation. The method works for arbitrary disorder distributions at any temperature. 
"We study dilatonic domain walls specific to superstring theory. Along with the matter fields and metric the dilaton also changes its value in the wall background. We found supersymmetric (extreme) solutions which in general interpolate between isolated superstring vacua with non-equal value of the matter potential; they correspond to the static, planar domain walls with {\it flat} metric in the string (sigma model) frame. We point out similarities between the space-time of dilatonic walls and that of charged dilatonic black holes. We also comment on non-extreme solutions corresponding to expanding bubbles. "
A study is made for ${\bf Z}_M\times {\bf Z}_N$ orbifolds of the modification of the form of the twisted sector Yukawa couplings when some of the states involved are excited twisted sectors rather than twisted sector ground states. 
"A simple model for the hadronic contribution to the photon vacuum polarization function $\Pi_{had}(q^2)$, for spacelike momenta, is presented. For small momenta, the two loop contribution from the pseudoscalar meson octet is computed from the chiral Lagrangian. The light quark contribution (which at low momentum gives the ${\cal O}(q^6)$ counterterm in the chiral Lagrangian) is calculated within a relativistic constituent quark model incorporating the momentum dependence of the quark mass. The perturbative gluons of QCD are included in a standard fashion. The total result is close to an estimate of $\Pi_{had}(q^2)$ that is obtained directly from $e^+e^-\to hadrons$ data. We further use our results for $\Pi_{had}(q^2)$ to calculate the ${\cal O}(e^4)$ hadronic contribution to lepton magnetic moments and to calculate $\alpha_{QED}(M_Z^2)$. A simpler model of constituent quarks with momentum independent masses gives less favourable results. "
"A q-discrete version of the two-dimensional Toda molecule equation is proposed through the direct method. Its solution, B\""acklund transformation and Lax pair are discussed. The reduction to the q-discrete cylindrical Toda molecule equation is also discussed. "
"We analyse in detail Mott's variable range hopping in one dimension, expanding on earlier work by Raikh and Ruzin. We show that the large conductance fluctuations in disordered insulators result from a subtle interplay between purely quantum phenomena and geometrical fluctuations arising from the energies and locations of the impurities. Our results compare very well with both experiments and numerical simulations. "
"We have observed reproducible conductance fluctuations at low temperature in a small GaAs:Si wire driven across the Anderson transition by the application of a gate voltage. We analyse quantitatively the log-normal conductance statistics in terms of truncated quantum fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations due to small changes of the electron energy (controlled by the gate voltage) cannot develop fully due to identified geometrical fluctuations of the resistor network describing the hopping through the sample. The evolution of the fluctuations versus electron energy and magnetic field shows that the fluctuations are non-ergodic, except in the critical insulating region of the Anderson transition, where the localization length is larger than the distance between Si impurities. The mean magnetoconductance is in good accordance with simulations based on the Forward-Directed-Paths analysis, i.e. it saturates to $ {\rm ln} (\sigma (H>1)/\sigma (0))\simeq 1, $ as $ \sigma (0) $ decreases over orders of magnitude in the strongly localized regime. "
We compare the two most popular approaches to the problem of instanton-antiinstanton interaction at high energies - the valley method and the effective-Lagrangian approach - and use them to calculate the next-to-next-to-leading term in the expansion of ``holy grail'' function determining the cross section with baryon number violation in the Standard Model. 
"The S-matrices for non-simply-laced affine Toda field theories are considered in the context of a generalised bootstrap principle. The S-matrices, and in particular their poles, depend on a parameter whose range lies between the Coxeter numbers of dual pairs of the corresponding non-simply-laced algebras. It is proposed that only odd order poles in the physical strip with positive coefficients throughout this range should participate in the bootstrap. All other singularities have an explanation in principle in terms of a generalised Coleman-Thun mechanism. Besides the S-matrices introduced by Delius, Grisaru and Zanon, the missing case ($f_4^{(1)},e_6^{(2)}$), is also considered and provides many interesting examples of pole generation. "
"We introduce a one dimensional disordered Ising model which at zero temperature is characterized by a non-trivial, non-self-averaging, overlap probability distribution when the impurity concentration vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. The form of the distribution can be calculated analytically for any realization of disorder. For non-zero impurity concentration the distribution becomes a self-averaging delta function centered on a value which can be estimated by the product of appropriate transfer matrices. "
"Let $B$ and $F=\frac 12F_{\mu \nu}dx^\mu \wedge dx^\nu $ be two forms, $F_{\mu \nu}$ being the field strength of an abelian connection $A$. The topological $BF$ system is given by the integral of $B\wedge F$. With ""kinetic energy'' terms added for $B$ and $A$, it generates a mass for $A$ thereby suggesting an alternative to the Higgs mechanism, and also gives the London equations. The $BF$ action, being the large length and time scale limit of this augmented action, is thus of physical interest. In earlier work, it has been studied on spatial manifold $\Sigma $ with boundaries $\partial \Sigma $, and the existence of edge states localised at $\partial \Sigma $ has been established. They are analogous to the conformal family of edge states to be found in a Chern-Simons theory in a disc. Here we introduce charges and vortices (thin flux tubes) as sources in the $BF$ system and show that they acquire an infinite number of spin excitations due to renormalization, just as a charge coupled to a Chern-Simons potential acquires a conformal family of spin excitations. For a vortex, these spins are transverse and attached to each of its points, so that it resembles a ribbon. Vertex operators for the creatin of these sources are constructed and interpreted in terms of a Wilson integral involving $A$ and a similar integral involving $B$. The standard spin-statistics theorem is proved for this sources. A new spin-statistics theorem, showing the equality of the ``interchange'' of two identical vortex loops and $2\pi $ rotation of the transverse spins of a constituent vortex, is established. Aharonov-Bohm interactions of charges and vortices are studied. The existence of topologically nontrivial vortex spins is pointed out and their vertex "
"Kouveliotou et al. (1993) recently confirmed that gamma-ray bursts are bimodal in duration. In this paper we compute the statistical properties of the short ($\le 2$~s) and long ($>2$~s) bursts using a method of analysis that makes no assumption regarding the location of the bursts, whether in the Galaxy or at a cosmological distance. We find the 64 ms channel on BATSE to be more sensitive to short bursts and the 1024 ms channel is more sensitive to long bursts. We show that all the currently available data are consistent with the simple hypothesis that both short and long bursts have the same spatial distribution and that within each population the sources are standard candles. The rate of short bursts is $\sim 0.4$ of the rate of long bursts. Although the durations of short and long gamma-ray bursts span several orders of magnitude and the total energy of a typical short burst is smaller than that of a typical long burst by a factor of $\sim 20$, surprisingly the peak luminosities of the two kinds of bursts are equal to within a factor of $\sim 2$. "
"We examine a recent suggestion by Milburn that slightly massive electron neutrinos, produced left-handed at the core of the sun, suffer geodetic precession adequate to render them right-handed (and therefore sterile) in sufficient numbers to solve the solar neutrino problem. In that light, we perform a complete, general-relativistic calculation of the geodetic spin precession of an ultrarelativistic particle in the Schwartzschild metric. We conclude that the effect is negligible, in disagreement with Milburn's analysis. "
"It is shown that in the constituent quark model of Georgi-Manohar, the dispersion relation that leads to the Adler-Weisberger sum rule for the axial vector coupling $g_A$ requires a subtraction constant. This fact explains the discrepancy between the results of different recent estimates of the $1/N_c$ corrections to Weinberg's large $N_c$ result $g_A=1$, where $N_c$ is the number of QCD colors. We also discuss a possible scenario which shows that $g_A=1$ might not be a necessary consequence of QCD in the large $N_c$ limit. "
"The recent results of the CLEO Collaboration on both inclusive and exclusive radiative $B$ decays are combined with those of the UA2 Collaboration on $W\gamma$ production to highly constrain the anomalous trilinear gauge couplings of the $W$. The theoretical analysis of the $b \to s\gamma$ process employs, next-to-leading order operator coefficient evolution as well as QCD bremsstrahlung and appropriate phase space corrections. "
"We study the long time behaviour of the transient before the collapse on the periodic attractors of a discrete deterministic asymmetric neural networks model. The system has a finite number of possible states so it is not possible to use the term chaos in the usual sense of sensitive dependence on the initial condition. Nevertheless, at varying the asymmetry parameter, $k$, one observes a transition from ordered motion (i.e. short transients and short periods on the attractors) to a ``complex'' temporal behaviour. This transition takes place for the same value $k_{\rm c}$ at which one has a change for the mean transient length from a power law in the size of the system ($N$) to an exponential law in $N$. The ``complex'' behaviour during the transient shows strong analogies with the chaotic behaviour: decay of temporal correlations, positive Shannon entropy, non-constant Renyi entropies of different orders. Moreover the transition is very similar to that one for the intermittent transition in chaotic systems: scaling law for the Shannon entropy and strong fluctuations of the ``effective Shannon entropy'' along the transient, for $k > k_{\rm c}$. "
"We analyze, by means of Melnikov method, the possibility of modifying the threshold of homoclinic chaos in general 1-dimensional problems, by introducing small periodic resonant modulations. We indicate in particular a prescription in order to increase the threshold (i.e. to prevent chaos), and consider then its application to the bistable Duffing-Holmes potential. All results are confirmed both by numerical and by analog simulations, showing that small modulations can in fact sensibly influence the onset of chaos. "
"If a substantial fraction of the observed gamma-ray bursts originates within an extended Galactic halo then their spatial distribution should deviate slightly from spherical symmetry in a very particular way which involves features both in the bursts' angular and radial distributions. This conclusion is based on various reasons which are all related to the presence and motion of the satellite galaxies around the Galaxy, and is independent of the nature and origin of the sources. We analyze the spatial distribution of the bursts, according to the BATSE catalog until March 1992, and argue that the expected signature of an extended Galactic halo model is indicated by the data. The distance to the faintest bursts in the halo is either $\sim130$ Kpc or $\sim270$ Kpc. Although a signature of a nearby-extragalactic distance scale in the data is very suggestive, we argue that a comparison with specific models is necessary before regarding our findings as a conclusive evidence. If the increasing data supports our results then gamma-ray bursts may be the first detected manifestations of nearby intergalactic objects, either primordial or which have escaped predominantely from our satellite galaxies. "
"Numerical simulations of a simple reaction--diffusion model reveal a surprising variety of irregular spatio--temporal patterns. These patterns arise in response to finite--amplitude perturbations. Some of them resemble the steady irregular patterns discussed by Lee et al. Others consist of spots which grow until they reach a critical size at which time they divide in two. If, in some region, the spots become overcrowded, all the spots in that region decay into the uniform background. "
"The spin degrees of freedom for the relativistic particle are described by either Poincar\'{e} group variables (classically) or Grassmann variables (pseudo-classically). The relationship between those two descriptions are given. In doing that, appropriate constraints are constructed to put into the lagrangian. Especially a natural relation of Poincar\'{e} group variables and Grassmann variables is obtained. Hopf fibration relating the spin momentum to the group is just the right transformation of the spin momentum under Poincar\'{e} group. And with the relation just mentioned, pseudoclassical lagrangian is derived naturally from the classical one. "
"We study a solvable QCD--like toy theory, a generalization of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, which implements chiral symmetries of light quarks and heavy quark symmetry. The chiral symmetric and chiral broken phases can be dynamically tuned. This implies a parity doubled heavy--light meson system, corresponding to a $(0^-,1^-)$ multiplet and a $(0^+,1^+)$ heavy spin multiplet. Consequently the mass difference of the two multiplets is given by a Goldberger--Treiman relation and $g_A$ is found to be small. The Isgur--Wise function, $\xi(w)$, the decay constant, $f_B$, and other observables are studied. "
"We consider quantum interferences of classically allowed or forbidden electronic trajectories in disordered dielectrics. Without assuming a directed path approximation, we represent a strongly disordered elastic scatterer by its transmission matrix ${\bf t}$. We recall how the eigenvalue distribution of ${\bf t.t}^{\dagger}$ can be obtained from a certain ansatz leading to a Coulomb gas analogy at a temperature $\beta^{-1}$ which depends on the system symmetries. We recall the consequences of this random matrix theory for quasi--$1d$ insulators and we extend our study to microscopic three dimensional models in the presence of transverse localization. For cubes of size $L$, we find two regimes for the spectra of ${\bf t.t}^{\dagger}$ as a function of the localization length $\xi$. For $L / \xi \approx 1 - 5$, the eigenvalue spacing distribution remains close to the Wigner surmise (eigenvalue repulsion). The usual orthogonal--unitary cross--over is observed for {\it large} magnetic field change $\Delta B \approx \Phi_0 /\xi^2$ where $\Phi_0$ denotes the flux quantum. This field reduces the conductance fluctuations and the average log--conductance (increase of $\xi$) and induces on a given sample large magneto--conductance fluctuations of typical magnitude similar to the sample to sample fluctuations (ergodic behaviour). When $\xi$ is of the order of the "
"In the Laguerre ensemble of N x N (positive) hermitian matrices, it is of interest both theoretically and for applications to quantum transport problems to compute the variance of a linear statistic, denoted var_N f, as N->infinity. Furthermore, this statistic often contains an additional parameter alpha for which the limit alpha->infinity is most interesting and most difficult to compute numerically. We derive exact expressions for both lim_{N->infinity} var_N f and lim_{alpha->infinity}lim_{N->infinity} var_N f. "
"During the evolution of density inhomogeneties in an $\Omega=1$, matter dominated universe, the typical density contrast changes from $\delta\simeq 10^{-4}$ to $\delta\simeq 10^2$. However, during the same time, the typical value of the gravitational potential generated by the perturbations changes only by a factor of order unity. This significant fact can be exploited to provide a new, powerful, approximation scheme for studying the formation of nonlinear structures in the universe. This scheme, discussed in this paper, evolves the initial perturbation using a Newtonian gravitational potential frozen in time. We carry out this procedure for different intial spectra and compare the results with the Zeldovich approximation and the frozen flow approximation (proposed by Mattarrese et al. recently). Our results are in far better agreement with the N-body simulations than the Zeldovich approximation. It also provides a dynamical explanation for the fact that pancakes remain thin during the evolution. While there is some superficial similarity between the frozen flow results and ours, they differ considerably in the velocity information. Actual shell crossing does occur in our approximation; also there is motion of particles along the pancakes leading to further clumping. These features are quite different from those in frozen flow model. We also discuss the evolution of the two-point correlation function in various approximations. "
The level spacing distributions which arise when one rescales the Laguerre or Jacobi ensembles of hermitian matrices is studied. These distributions are expressible in terms of a Fredholm determinant of an integral operator whose kernel is expressible in terms of Bessel functions of order $\alpha$. We derive a system of partial differential equations associated with the logarithmic derivative of this Fredholm determinant when the underlying domain is a union of intervals. In the case of a single interval this Fredholm determinant is a Painleve tau function. 
"We argue that simple dynamical systems are factors of finite automata, regarded as dynamical systems on discontinuum. We show that any homeomorphism of the real interval is of this class. An orientation preserving homeomorphism of the circle is a factor of a finite automaton iff its rotation number is rational. Any $S$-unimodal system on the real interval, whose kneading sequence is either periodic odd or preperiodic, is also a factor of a finite automaton, while $S$-unimodal systems at limits of period doubling bifurcations are not. "
"The three dimensional black hole solutions of Ba\~nados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ) are dimensionally reduced in various different ways. Solutions are obtained to the Jackiw-Teitelboim theory of two dimensional gravity for spinless BTZ black holes, and to a simple extension with a non-zero dilaton potential for black holes of fixed spin. Similar reductions are given for charged black holes. The resulting two dimensional solutions are themselves black holes, and are appropriate for investigating exact ``S-wave'' scattering in the BTZ metrics. Using a different dimensional reduction to the string inspired model of two dimensional gravity, the BTZ solutions are related to the familiar two dimensional black hole and the linear dilaton vacuum. "
"The growth of density perturbations in an expanding universe in the non-linear regime is investigated. The underlying equations of motion are cast in a suggestive form, and motivate a conjecture that the scaled pair velocity, $h(a,x)\equiv -[v/(\dot{a}x)]$ depends on the expansion factor $a$ and comoving coordinate $x$ only through the density contrast $\sigma(a,x)$. This leads to the result that the true, non-linear, density contrast $<(\delta\rho/\rho)^{2}_{x}>^{1/2}=\sigma(a,x)$ is a universal function of the density contrast $\sigma_L(a,l)$, computed in the linear theory and evaluated at a scale $l$ where $l=x(1+\sigma^2)^{1/3}$. This universality is supported by existing numerical simulations with scale-invariant initial conditions having different power laws. We discuss a physically motivated ansatz $h(a,x)=h[\sigma^2(a,x)]$ and use it to compute the non-linear density contrast at any given scale analytically. This provides a promising method for analysing the non-linear evolution of density perturbations in the universe and for interpreting numerical simulations. "
"We prove that if A is the basin of immediate attraction to a periodic attracting or parabolic point for a rational map f on the Riemann sphere, then periodic points in the boundary of A are dense in this boundary. To prove this in the non simply- connected or parabolic situations we prove a more abstract, geometric coding trees version. "
"The problem of metrizability for the dynamical systems accepting the normal shift is formulated and solved. The explicit formula for the force field of metrizable Newtonian dynamical system $\ddot\bold r=\bold F(\bold r,\dot\bold r)$ is found. "
"The quasipotential formalism for elastic scattering from relativistic bound states is formulated based on the instant constraint in the Breit frame. The quasipotential electromagnetic current is derived from Mandelstam's five-point kernel and obeys a two-body Ward identity. Breit-frame wave functions are obtained directly by solving integral equations with nonzero total three-momentum, thus accomplishing a dynamical boost. Calculations of electron-deuteron elastic form factors illustrate the importance of the dynamical boost versus kinematic boosts of the rest frame wave functions. "
We further study the nonperturbative formulation of two-dimensional black holes. We find a nonlinear differential equation satisfied by the tachyon in the black hole background. We show that singularities in the tachyon field configurations are always associated with divergent semiclassical expansions and are absent in the exact theory. We also discuss how the Euclidian black hole emerges from an analytically continued fermion theory that corresponds to the right side up harmonic oscillator potential. 
"We investigate the origin of the arrow of time in quantum mechanics in the context of quantum cosmology. The ``Copenhagen'' quantum mechanics of measured subsystems incorporates a fundamental arrow of time. Extending discussions of Aharonov, Bergmann and Lebovitz, Griffiths, and others we investigate a generalized quantum mechanics for cosmology that utilizes both an initial and a final density matrix to give a time-neutral formulation without a fundamental arrow of time. Time asymmetries can arise for particular universes from differences between their initial and final conditions. Theories for both would be a goal of quantum cosmology. A special initial condition and a final condition of indifference would be sufficient to explain the observed time asymmetries of the universe. In this essay we ask under what circumstances a completely time symmetric universe, with T-symmetric initial and final condition, could be consistent with the time asymmetries of the limited domain of our experience. We discuss the approach to equilibrium, the electromagnetic system, and T-violation in the weak interactions in such universes. The decoherence of alternatives that is necessary for the prediction of probabilities in the quantum mechanics of closed systems is the origin of a fundamental limitation on quantum cosmologies with initial and final conditions. The initial and final density matrices cannot both be pure; if they are there is no decoherence and no prediction. "
"We study an information-theoretic measure of uncertainty for quantum systems. It is the Shannon information $I$ of the phase space probability distribution $\la z | \rho | z \ra $, where $|z \ra $ are coherent states, and $\rho$ is the density matrix. The uncertainty principle is expressed in this measure as $I \ge 1$. For a harmonic oscillator in a thermal state, $I$ coincides with von Neumann entropy, $- \Tr(\rho \ln \rho)$, in the high-temperature regime, but unlike entropy, it is non-zero at zero temperature. It therefore supplies a non-trivial measure of uncertainty due to both quantum and thermal fluctuations. We study $I$ as a function of time for a class of non-equilibrium quantum systems consisting of a distinguished system coupled to a heat bath. We derive an evolution equation for $I$. For the harmonic oscillator, in the Fokker-Planck regime, we show that $I$ increases monotonically. For more general Hamiltonians, $I$ settles down to monotonic increase in the long run, but may suffer an initial decrease for certain initial states that undergo ``reassembly'' (the opposite of quantum spreading). Our main result is to prove, for linear systems, that $I$ at each moment of time has a lower bound $I_t^{min}$, over all possible initial states. This bound is a generalization of the uncertainty principle to include thermal fluctuations in non-equilibrium systems, and represents the least amount of uncertainty the system must suffer after evolution in the presence of an environment for time $t$. "
"Recent large scale structure observations, including COBE, have prompted many authors to discuss modifications of the standard Cold Dark Matter model. Two of these, a tilted spectrum and a gravitational wave contribution to COBE, are at some level demanded by theory under the usual assumption that inflation generates the primeval perturbations. The third, whose motivation comes by contrast from observation, is the introduction of a component of hot dark matter to give the Mixed Dark Matter model. We discuss the implication of taking these modifications together. Should Mixed Dark Matter prove necessary, very strong constraints on inflationary models will ensue. "
"Conventional superstring derived E$_6$ models can accommodate small neutrino masses if a discrete symmetry is imposed which forbids tree level Dirac neutrino masses but allows for radiative mass generation. Since the only possible symmetries of this kind are known to be generation dependent, we explore the possibility that the three sets of light states in each generation do not have the same assignments with respect to the 27 of $E_6$, leading to non universal gauge interactions under the additional $U(1)'$ factors for the known fermions. We argue that models realising such a scenario are viable, with their structure being constrained mainly by the requirement of the absence of flavor changing neutral currents in the Higgs sector. Moreover, in contrast to the standard case, rank 6 models are not disfavoured with respect to rank 5. By requiring the number of light neutral states to be minimal, these models have an almost unique pattern of neutrino masses and mixings. We construct a model based on the unconventional assignment scenario in which (with a natural choice of the parameters) $m_{\nut}\sim O(10)$eV is generated at one loop, $m_{\num}$ is generated at two loops and lies in a range interesting for the solar neutrino problem, and $\nue$ remains massless. In addition, since baryon and lepton number are conserved, there is no proton decay in the model. To illustrate the non-standard phenomenology implied by our scheme we also discuss a second scenario in which an attempt for solving the solar neutrino puzzle with matter enhanced oscillations and practically massless neutrinos can be formulated, and in which peculiar effects for the $\num$ --> $\nut$ conversion of the upward-going atmospheric neutrinos could arise as well. "
"There is renewed interest in performing a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment using accelerator neutrinos because of a discrepancy between the measured and the predicted values of the ratio of electron to muon neutrinos produced in the upper atmosphere by cosmic rays.The approximate range in oscillation parameter space indicated by the Kamiokande atmospheric neutrino results and confirmed by IMB is bounded by $ 10^{-3}~ eV^2 < \dmsq < 10^{-1}~ eV^2 $ and $\s2t > 0.4~$. To reach such small $\dmsq$, using an accelerator as the source of neutrinos where the energy is typically 1 GeV or greater, requires baselines in the range of 10~km to 1000~km. In this talk I will give an overview of the most likely possibilities for such a long baseline accelerator neutrino oscillation experiment. "
"A criterion to be satisfied by a string theory of QCD is formulated in the ultraviolet regime. It arises from the trace anomaly of the QCD stress tensor computed using instantons. It is sensitive to asymptotic freedom. It appears to be related to the trace anomaly of the QCD string. Our current understanding of noncritical strings in physical dimensions is limited, but remarkably, a formal treatment of the bosonic string yields numerical agreement both in magnitude and sign for the gauge group SU(2). "
Custodial $SU(2)$ breaking due to dynamical fermion masses is studied in a rather general context and it is shown how some well known limiting cases are correctly described. The type of ``gap equation'' which can systematically lead to extra negative contributions to the so--called $\rho$--parameter is emphasized. Furthermore general model independent features are discussed and it is shown how electro--weak precision measurements can be sensitive to the fermion content and/or dynamical features of a given theory. 
"We study the equations for the quasi-momenta which characterize the wave-functions in the Bethe ansatz for the XXX-Heisenberg model. We show in a simple analytical fashion, that the usual ``string hypothesis"" incorrectly predicts the number of real solutions and the number of complex solutions for $N>21$ in the sector with two spins flipped, confirming the work of Essler et al. Two complex pair solutions drop out and form two additional real pair solutions. We also introduce a new set of variables which allows the equations to be written as a single polynomial equation in one variable. We consider in some detail the case of three spins flipped. "
"In this talk we report some results about the construction of soliton solutions for the Affine and Conformal Affine Toda models using the Hirota's method. We obtain new classes of solitons connected to the degeneracies of the Cartan matrix eigenvalues as well as to some particular features of the recursive scheme developed here. We obtain an universal mass formula for all those solitons. The examples of $SU(6)$ and $Sp(3)$ are discussed in some detail. ( Talk presented at the VII J.A. Swieca Summer School, Section: Particles and Fields, Campos do Jord\~ao - Brasil - January/93) "
"We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a symmetry restoring phase transition in a scalar field theory, the ``system'', linearly coupled to another scalar field taken as a ``heat bath''. The ``system'' is initially in an ordered low temperature phase, and the heat bath is at a temperature close to the critical temperature for the system. We estimate the time at which the phase transition to the disordered (symmetric) phase takes place. We derive, and integrate the one-loop effective equations of motion for the order parameter that include the effects of the heat bath. A semiclassical Langevin equation is derived and it is found that it contains a non-dissipative, non-Markovian kernel, the noise term is colored and correlated on time scales determined by the temperature of the heat bath. The range of validity of the Langevin equation and a consistent procedure to incorporate corrections are discussed. "
"We show that the Clebsch - Gordan coefficients for the $SU(2)_{p,q}$ - algebra depend on a single parameter Q = $\sqrt{pq}$ ,contrary to the explicit calculation of Smirnov and Wehrhahn [J.Phys.A 25 (1992),5563]. "
"Braid theory is used to calcualte the topological entropy of data from the belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction, the results agree well with one-dimensional theory to the order of approximation considered. "
"With CPT-invariant initial conditions that commute with CPT-invariant final conditions, the respective probabilities (when defined) of a set of histories and its CPT reverse are equal, giving a CPT-symmetric universe. This leads me to question whether the asymmetry of the Gell-Mann--Hartle decoherence functional for ordinary quantum mechanics should be interpreted as an asymmetry of {\it time} . "
It is shown that the generalized (with nonpolynomial Lagrangian) Chern-Simons membranes and in general $p$-branes moving in $D$-dimensional target space admit an infinite set of secondary constraints. With respect to the Poisson bracket these constraints satisfy closed algebra containing $p$-dimensional classical $W$ algebra as a subalgebra. In the case when the target space dimension $D$ is finite the theory is topological. 
"Arguments are given that time must be defined in an operative manner,i.e., by constructing devices which can serve as clocks.The investigation of such devices leads to the conclusion that there is a principal uncertainity of time if one considers periods which are not large compared with the Planck time. Thus,according to the old (classical) concept,time cannot be well-defined at this scale.The uncertainity of time leads to a breakdown of Special and General relativity in the Planck regime;the same happens with causality. We present arguments that the classical concept of time,which treats t simply as a real parameter,must be replaced by a new one. "
"In an abelian topologically massive gauge theory, any eigenstate of the Hamiltonian can be decomposed into a factor describing massive propagating gauge bosons and a Chern-Simons wave function describing a set of nonpropagating ``topological'' excitations. The energy depends only on the propagating modes, and energy eigenstates thus occur with a degeneracy that can be parametrized by the Hilbert space of the pure Chern-Simons theory. We show that for a {\em nonabelian} topologically massive gauge theory, this degeneracy is lifted: although the Gauss law constraint can be solved with a similar factorization, the Hamiltonian couples the propagating and nonpropagating (topological) modes. "
"Recent data on the $D^*$ masses confirm the QCD prediction based on the \REF{\ICHJL}{Isaac Cohen and Harry J. Lipkin, \plb{84}{323}{1979}} very general assumption $\({\ICHJL}\)$ that the spin-dependence of the quark couplings to photons and gluons have the same structure and differ only in the value of the coupling constants, This prediction with no free parameters and using the $\Xi$ and $\Xi^*$ masses as input follows from noting that the charmed antiquark $\bar c$ and the strange diquark (ss) have exactly the same couplings to both the photon (Q=-2/3) and to the gluon (both are color antitriplets). New predictions are obtained with this approach. Corrections to the naive model are investigated and shown to be small. "
"Using a hybrid approach, based on the recursion relations for shape invariant potentials developed by Das and Huang and a time-dependent tranformation of variables, we derive the propagator for a radial oscillator. Although this is not a new result, we explicitly show that time-dependent tranformations are very beneficial even within the context of time-independent Hamiltonians in quantum mechanics. "
We show how the classical-quantum correspondence permits long-lived subharmonic motion in a quantum system driven by a periodic force. Exponentially small deviations from exact subharmonicity are due to coherent tunneling between quantized vortex tubes which surround classical elliptic periodic orbits. 
A covariant - tensor method for $SU(2)_{q}$ is described. This tensor method is used to calculate q - deformed Clebsch - Gordan coefficients. The connection with covariant oscillators and irreducible tensor operators is established. This approach can be extended to other quantum groups. 
"We obtain the formula for intertwining operator(R-matrix) of quantum universal enveloping superalgebra U_qOSP(1,2) for U_qOSP(1,2)-Verma modules. By its restriction we obtain the R-matrix for two semiperiodic(semicyclic), two spin-j and spin-j and semiperiodic representations "
"We consider a simple model of a scalar field with $U(1)$ current algebra gauge symmetry coupled to $2D$-gravity in order to clarify the origin of Stuckelberg symmetry in the $w_{\infty}$-gravity theory. An analogous symmetry takes place in our model too. The possible central extension of the complete symmetry algebra and the corresponding critical dimension have been found. The analysis of the Hamiltonian and the constraints shows that the generators of the current algebra, the reparametrization and the Stuckelberg symmetries are not independent. The connection of the model with $w_{1+\infty}-$ and $W_{1+\infty}$-gravity is discussed. "
"In this paper, we present the exact solution to a one-dimensional, two-component, quantum many-body system in which like particles interact with a pair potential $s(s+1)/{\rm sinh}^{2}(r)$, while unlike particles interact with a pair potential $-s(s+1)/{\rm cosh}^{2}(r)$. We first give a proof of integrability, then derive the coupled equations determining the complete spectrum. All singularities occur in the ground state when there are equal numbers of the two components; we give explicit results for the ground state and low-lying states in this case. For $s>0$, the system is an antiferromagnet/insulator, with excitations consisting of a pair-hole--pair continuum, a two-particle continuum with gap, and excitons with gaps. For $-1<s<0$, the system has excitations consisting of a hole-particle continuum, and a two-spin wave continuum, both gap-less. "
"Exact expressions for the partition functions of the rigid string and membrane at any temperature are obtained in terms of hypergeometric functions. By using zeta function regularization methods, the results are analytically continued and written as asymptotic sums of Riemann-Hurwitz zeta functions, which provide very good numerical approximations with just a few first terms. This allows to obtain systematic corrections to the results of Polchinski et al., corresponding to the limits $T\rightarrow 0$ and $T\rightarrow \infty$ of the rigid string, and to analyze the intermediate range of temperatures. In particular, a way to obtain the Hagedorn temperature for the rigid membrane is thus found. "
"The decay $Z^{0}\rightarrow Q+ \ell^{+}\ell^{-}$, where $Q$ is a $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ quarkonium state, has a very clean final state, which should make it easy to detect. The branching ratio of this mode is greater than $10^{-6}$ for $\rho$, $\phi$, and $\psi$, indicating that these processes may be detectable at LEP. "
"We review the basics of the dynamics of closed strings moving along the discretized line \Z. The string excitations are described by a field \phi_x(\tau) where x is the position of the string in the embedding space and \tau is a semi-infinite ``euclidean time'' parameter related to the longitudinal mode of the string. Interactions due to splitting and joining of closed strings are taken into account by a local potential and occur only along the edge \tau =0 of the semi-plane (x, \tau). "
"A discretized time evolution of the wave function for a Dirac particle on a cubic lattice is represented by a very simple quantum cellular automaton. In each evolution step the updated value of the wave function at a given site depends only on the values at the nearest sites, the evolution is unitary and preserves chiral symmetry. Moreover, it is shown that the relationship between Dirac particles and cellular automata operating on two component objects on a lattice is indeed very close. Every local and unitary automaton on a cubic lattice, under some natural assumptions, leads in the continuum limit to the Weyl equation. The sum over histories is evaluated and its connection with path integrals and theories of fermions on a lattice is outlined. "
"We investigate the effects of the spontaneous CP violation at finite temperature in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model on the baryogenesis at the weak scale. After a brief discussion of the case in which the electroweak phase transition is of the second order, we study in details the baryogenesis scenario when the transition proceeds via bubble nucleation. We show that the space-time dependent phase for the Higgs vacuum expectation values coming from the spontaneous CP violation can give rise to a efficient generation of baryon number inside the bubble walls if the superpotential parameters and the soft supersymmetry breaking ones are complex. However we find that in order to get the observed value for the baryon asymmetry of the universe the phases of such parameters can be as small as $10^{-5}$, giving rise to an electron dipole moment of the neutron well below the current experimental limit. Moreover a light Higgs pseudoscalar is needed, and an upper bound on its mass is obtained. "
"We find the exact quasiparticle spectrum for the continuum Kondo problem of $k$ species of electrons coupled to an impurity of spin $S$. In this description, the impurity becomes an immobile quasiparticle sitting on the boundary. The particles are ``kinks'', which can be thought of as field configurations interpolating between adjacent wells of a potential with $k+1$ degenerate minima. For the overscreened case $k>2S$, the boundary has this kink structure as well, which explains the non-integer number of boundary states previously observed. Using simple arguments along with the consistency requirements of an integrable theory, we find the exact elastic $S$-matrix for the quasiparticles scattering among themselves and off of the boundary. This allows the calculation of the exact free energy, which agrees with the known Bethe ansatz solution. "
"Action functionals describing relativistic perfect fluids are presented. Two of these actions apply to fluids whose equations of state are specified by giving the fluid energy density as a function of particle number density and entropy per particle. Other actions apply to fluids whose equations of state are specified in terms of other choices of dependent and independent fluid variables. Particular cases include actions for isentropic fluids and pressureless dust. The canonical Hamiltonian forms of these actions are derived, symmetries and conserved charges are identified, and the boundary value and initial value problems are discussed. As in previous works on perfect fluid actions, the action functionals considered here depend on certain Lagrange multipliers and Lagrangian coordinate fields. Particular attention is paid to the interpretations of these variables and to their relationships to the physical properties of the fluid. "
"The growth of a diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) cluster with mass $M$ and radius of gyration $R$ is described by a set of growth probabilities $\{ p_i\}$, where $p_i$ is the probability that the perimeter site $i$ will be the next to grow. We introduce the joint distribution $N(\alpha, x, M)$, where $N(\alpha,x,M)d\alpha dx$ is the number of perimeter sites with $\alpha$-values in the range $\alpha\le \alpha_i \le \alpha+d\alpha$ (``$\alpha$-sites'') and located in the annulus [x, x+dx] around the cluster seed. Here, $\alpha_i \equiv -\ln p_i / \ln R$ if $p_i>0$, $x\equiv r_i/R$, and $r_i$ is the distance of site $i$ from the seed of the DLA cluster. We use $N(\alpha,x,M)$ to relate multifractal and multiscaling properties of DLA. In particular, we find that for large $M$ the location of the $\alpha$-sites is peaked around a fixed value $\bar x(\alpha)$; in contrast, the perimeter sites with $p_i=0$ are uniformly distributed over the DLA cluster. "
We investigate the limit of Brans-Dicke spacetimes as the scalar field coupling constant omega tends to infinity applying a coordinate-free technique. We obtain the limits of some known exact solutions. It is shown that these limits may not correspond to similar solutions in the general relativity theory. 
We calculate the chiral corrections to Weinberg's prediction for the S--wave $\pi N$ scattering lengths up--to--and--including order ${\cal O}(M_\pi^3)$ making use of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. For the isospin--odd scattering length $a^-$ these corrections are small and bring the prediction closer to the empirical value. In the case of the isospin--even $a^+$ large cancellations appear so that the ${\cal O}(M_\pi^3)$ result depends sensitively on certain resonance parameters which enter the calculation of the contact terms present at next--to--leading order. 
"Velocity dispersion $\sigma$, radius $R$ and luminosity $L$ of elliptical galaxies are known to be related, leaving only two degrees of freedom and defining the so-called ``fundamental plane"". In this {\em Letter} we present observational evidence that rich galaxy clusters exhibit a similar behaviour. Assuming a relation $L \propto R^{\alpha}\sigma^{2 \beta}$, the best-fit values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are very close to those defined by galaxies. The dispersion of this relation is lower than 10 percent, i.e. significantly smaller than the dispersion observed in the $L-\sigma$ and $L-R$ relations. We briefly suggest some possible implications on the spread of formation times of objects and on peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters. "
"We compute the thermally averaged $\qq$--annihilation rate into two and three gluons in the early universe. We show that at very high temperatures $\qq\to ggg$ represents only a 3\%\ correction to $\qq\to gg$. Comparing the annihilation rate to the Hubble rate, corrected for particle interactions in the Standard Model gas, we find that quarks and gluons are not in chemical equilibrium when $T\gsim 3\times 10^{14}$ GeV. "
"Davydov's model of solitons in alpha-helix protein chains is shown to display features of self-organized criticality (SOC), i.e., power law behaviour of correlations in space and 1/f-noise, as a consequence of considering random peptide group displacements from their (periodic) equilibrium positions along a chain. This may shed light on a basic mechanism leading to obtain flicker noise in alpha-helix protein chains and to predict a SOC regime in biomolecular structures from first principles. We believe our treatment of 1/f noise to be of some relevance to recent findings due to Voss on DNA [Phys. Rev. Lett. 68, 3805 (1992)]. "
"We recently proposed a QCD-Pomeron described by the exchange of two non-perturbative gluons characterized by a dynamically generated gluon mass. It is here shown that data on elastic scattering, exclusive $\rho$ production in deep inelastic scattering and the $J/\Psi$-nucleon total cross-section can be successfully described in terms of a single gluon mass $m_g\simeq0.37$~GeV. We observe that the total cross sections of hadrons with small radii, such as $J/\Psi$, have a marked dependence on the effective gluon mass. "
"By solving the supersymmetry constraints for physical wave-functions, it is shown that the only two allowed bosonic states in $ N = 1 $ supergravity are of the form const.~exp~$(\pm I / \hbar) $, where $ I $ is an action functional of the three-metric. States containing a finite number of fermions are forbidden. In the case that the spatial topology is $ S^3 $, the state const.~exp~$(- I / \hbar)$ is the wormhole ground state, and the state const.~exp~$(I / \hbar)$ is the Hartle--Hawking state. $ N = 1 $ supergravity has no quantum ultraviolet divergences, and no quantum corrections. "
We present a thorough analysis of the Non Intersecting String (NIS) model and its exact solution. This is an integrable $q$-states vertex model describing configurations of non-intersecting polygons on the lattice. The exact eigenvalues of the transfer matrix are found by analytic Bethe Ansatz. The Bethe Ansatz equations thus found are shown to be equivalent to those for a mixed spin model involving both 1/2 and infinite spin. This indicates that the NIS model provides a representation of the quantum group $SU(2)_{\hat q}$ ($|\hat q|\not= 1$) corresponding to spins $s=1/2$ and $s=\infty$. The partition function and the excitations in the thermodynamic limit are computed.

"We calculate order $\alpha_s$ color magnetic corrections to the valence quark distributions of the proton using the Los Alamos Model Potential wavefunctions. The spin-spin interaction breaks the model SU(4) symmetry, providing a natural mechanism for the difference between the up and down distributions. For a value of $\alpha_s$ sufficient to produce the $N-\Delta$ mass splitting, we find up and down quark distributions in reasonable agreement with experiment. "
"We present a calculation of the branching ratio $\brbsg$ in two well motivated supersymmetric models: the minimal $SU(5)$ and the no-scale flipped $SU(5)$ supergravity models. We find that the improved CLEO upper bound ($\brbsg<5.4\times10^{-4}$ at 95\% CL) does not yet constrain the minimal $SU(5)$ supergravity model, where $\brbsg_{minimal}=(2.3-3.6)\times10^{-4}$. In the flipped $SU(5)$ model the CLEO bound is constraining, although still not very significantly, even for light charged Higgs masses. An improvement in sensitivity by a factor of two will probe all (more than half) of the parameter space of the minimal (flipped) $SU(5)$ supergravity model. This ``resolution"" of the $\bsg$ microscope far surpasses that of present collider experiments. In the flipped model there exists a significant region of parameter space where $\brbsg$ is highly suppressed due to a new phenomenon involving a complicated cancellation against the QCD correction parameter. "
Supersymmetric radiative corrections to the partial width $\Gamma (\tau \rightarrow e \nu \bar{\nu})$ and the masses of the $W$ and $Z$ gauge bosons are calculated in different renormalization schemes. The importance of the non-universal contributions is analyzed. 
"The Vlasov-Einstein system describes the evolution of an ensemble of particles (such as stars in a galaxy, galaxies in a galaxy cluster etc.) interacting only by the gravitational field which they create collectively and which obeys Einstein's field equations. The matter distribution is described by the Vlasov or Liouville equation for a collisionless gas. Recent investigations seem to indicate that such a matter model is particularly suited in a general relativistic setting and may avoid the formation of naked singularities, as opposed to other matter models. In the present note we consider the Vlasov-Einstein system in a spherically symmetric setting and prove the existence of static solutions which are asymptotically flat and have finite total mass and finite extension of the matter. Among these there are smooth, singularity-free solutions, which have a regular center and may have isotropic or anisotropic pressure, and solutions, which have a Schwarzschild-singularity at the center. The paper extends previous work, where smooth, globally defined solutions with regular center and isotropic pressure were considered. "
"We explore the implications of recent work by Br\'ezin and Zinn-Justin, applying the renormalization group techniques from critical phenomena to the scaling limit of matrix models in two-dimensional quantum gravity. They endeavor to get the lowest order fixed points of the theory giving insight upon the critical points of the theory. We show that at leading order the perturbative result is equal to the saddle-point approximation result. We calculate the next-to-leading order in the perturbative expansion exploring the goodness of the approach. "
"A general family of charge-current carrying cosmic string models is investigated. In the special case of circular configurations in arbitrary axially symmetric gravitational and electromagnetic backgrounds the dynamics is determined by simple point particle Hamiltonians. A certain ""duality"" transformation relates our results to previous ones, obtained by Carter et. al., for an infinitely long open stationary string in an arbitrary stationary background. "
"The effective theory describing infinite mass particles with a given velocity, has a great interest in heavy flavor physics. It has the unpleasant characteristic that the energy spectrum is unbounded from below; this fact is the source of the problems in the formulation of the euclidean theory. In this paper we present an analysis of the euclidean effective theory, that is rather complete and has positive conclusions. A proof of the consistency of the euclidean theory is presented and a technique for the evaluation of the amplitudes in perturbation theory is described. We compute also the one-loop renormalization constants of the lattice effective theory and of the heavy-heavy current that is needed for the determination of the Isgur-Wise function. A variety of effects related to the explicit breaking of the Lorentz symmetry of lattice regularization is demonstrated. The most peculiar phenomenon is that the heavy quark velocity receives a finite renormalization. Finally, we compute the lattice-continuum renormalization constant of the Isgur-Wise current. It is needed for the conversion of the values of the matrix elements computed with the lattice effective theory, to the values in the full theory. "
Using perturbative methods we derive new results for the spectrum and correlation functions of the general Z_3-chiral Potts quantum chain in the massive low-temperature phase. Explicit calculations of the ground state energy and the first excitations in the zero momentum sector give excellent approximations and confirm the general statement that the spectrum in the low-temperature phase of general Z_n-spin quantum chains is identical to one in the high-temperature phase where the role of charge and boundary conditions are interchanged. Using a perturbative expansion of the ground state for the Z_3 model we are able to gain some insight in correlation functions. We argue that they might be oscillating and give estimates for the oscillation length as well as the correlation length. 
"The lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is used to study the kinetics of domain growth of a binary fluid in a number of geometries modeling porous media. Unlike the traditional methods which solve the Cahn-Hilliard equation, the LB method correctly simulates fluid properties, phase segregation, interface dynamics and wetting. Our results, based on lattice sizes of up to $4096\times 4096$, do not show evidence to indicate the breakdown of late stage dynamical scaling, and suggest that confinement of the fluid is the key to the slow kinetics observed. Randomness of the pore structure appears unnecessary. "
"Colour transparency is a cute and indispensable property of QCD as the gauge theory of strong interaction. CT tests of QCD consist of production of the perturbative small-sized hadronic state and measuring the strngth of its non-perturbative diffraction nteraction in a nuclear matter. The energy depenednce of the final- state interaction in a nuclear matter probes a dynamical evolution from the perturbative small-sized state to the full-sized nonperturbative hadron. QCD observables of CT experiments correspond to a novel mechanism of scanning of hadronic wave functions from the large nonperturbative to the small perturbative size. In these lectures, which are addressed to experimentalists and theorists, I discuss the principle ideas of CT physics and the physics potential of the hadron and electron facilities in the > 10 GeV energy range. The special effort was made to present the material in the pedagigical and self-consistent way, with an emphasis on the underlying rich quantum-mechanical interference phenomena. "
"Outgoing nucleon polarization in exclusive deuteron electrodisintegration is studied at the quasi-elastic peak in the standard theory with emphasis on the effect of nucleonic and pionic relativistic corrections. The cases of polarized beam or/and polarized target are considered. Sizeable relativistic effects are pointed out in several polarization components. The sensitivity of nucleon polarization to the neutron charge form factor $G_E^n$ is discussed. In particular, it is shown that the longitudinal component of neutron polarization with vector polarized deuterons is as sensitive to $G_E^n$ as the sideways beam polarization transfer. "
"We prove that for an open system, in the Markovian regime, it is always possible to construct an infinite number of non trivial sets of histories that exactly satisfy the probability sum rules. In spite of being perfectly consistent, these sets manifest a very non--classical behavior: they are quite unstable under the addition of an extra instant to the list of times defining the history. To eliminate this feature --whose implications for the interpretation of the formalism we discuss-- and to achieve the stability that characterizes the quasiclassical domain, it is necessary to separate the instants which define the history by time intervals significantly larger than the typical decoherence time. In this case environment induced superselection is very effective and the quasiclassical domain is characterized by histories constructed with ``pointer projectors''. "
"We analyze the behavior of the ensemble of surface boundaries of the critical clusters at $T=T_c$ in the $3d$ Ising model. We find that $N_g(A)$, the number of surfaces of given genus $g$ and fixed area $A$, behaves as $A^{-x(g)}$ $e^{-\mu A}$. We show that $\mu$ is a constant independent of $g$ and $x(g)$ is approximately a linear function of $g$. The sum of $N_g(A)$ over genus scales as a power of $A$. We also observe that the volume of the clusters is proportional to its surface area. We argue that this behavior is typical of a branching instability for the surfaces, similar to the ones found for non-critical string theories with $c > 1$. We discuss similar results for the ordinary spin clusters of the $3d$ Ising model at the minority percolation point and for $3d$ bond percolation. Finally we check the universality of these critical properties on the simple cubic lattice and the body centered cubic lattice. "
"Matrix elements of the form $ <0| Tr \; g^{2}GG |G> $ are calculated using the lattice QCD Monte Carlo method. Here, $|G>$ is a glueball state with quantum numbers $ 0^{++}$, $ 2^{++}$, $ 0^{-+}$ and $G$ is the gluon field strength operator. The matrix elements are obtained from the hybrid correlation functions of the fuzzy and plaquette operators performed on the $12^{4}$ and $14^{4}$ lattices at $\beta = 5.9 $ and $5.96$ respectively. These matrix elements are compared with those from the QCD sum rules and the tensor meson dominance model. They are the non-perturbative matrix elements needed in the calculation of the partial widths of $J/\Psi$ radiative decays into glueballs. "
"In a previous paper [\AS], we used superspace techniques to prove that perturbation theory (around a classical solution with no zero modes) for Chern--Simons quantum field theory on a general $3$-manifold $M$ is finite. We conjectured (and proved for the case of $2$-loops) that, after adding counterterms of the expected form, the terms in the perturbation theory define topological invariants. In this paper we prove this conjecture. Our proof uses a geometric compactification of the region on which the Feynman integrand of Feynman diagrams is smooth as well as an extension of the basic propagator of the theory. "
Usual coset construction $\SU{k}\times\SU{l}/\SU{k+l}$ of Wess--Zumino conformal field theory is presented as a coset construction of minimal models. This new coset construction can be defined rigorously and allows one to calculate easily correlation functions of a number of primary fields. 
We consider in detail various theoretical uncertainties of the perturbative predictions for the decay width of $H^0\rightarrow b\overline{b}$ process in the region $50\ GeV< M_H\leq 2M_W$. We calculate the order $O(\alpha_s^2)$-contributions to the expression for $\Gamma_{Hb\overline{b}}$ through the pole quark mass and demonstrate that they are important for the elimination of the numerical difference between the corresponding expression and the one through the running $b$-quark mass. The order $O(\alpha\alpha_s)$ and $O(\alpha^2)$ massless and order $O(m_b^2/M_H^2)$ massive corrections to $\Gamma_{Hb\overline{b}}$ are also calculated. The importance of the latter contributions for modeling of the threshold effects is demonstrated. The troubles with identifying of the 4 recent L3 events $e^+e^-\rightarrow l^+l^-\gamma\gamma$ with the decay of a Standard Higgs boson are discussed. 
The dynamical breakdown of the $SU(2) \times U(1)$ symmetry triggered by a top-antitop condensate is studied in a supersymmetric version of the gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. An effective potential approach is used to investigate the vacuum structure and the equivalence with the minimal supersymmetric standard model. The role of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms is analyzed in detail in a version of the model where the electroweak gauge interactions are turned off. 
A manifestly covariant equation is derived to describe the perturbations in a domain wall on a given background spacetime. This generalizes recent work on domain walls in Minkowski space and introduces a framework for examining the stability of relativistic bubbles in curved spacetimes. 
"We consider a self-interacting scalar field theory in a slowly varying gravitational background field. Using zeta-function regularization and heat-kernel techniques, we derive the one-loop effective Lagrangian up to second order in the variation of the background field and up to quadratic terms in the curvature tensors. Specializing to different spacetimes of physical interest, the influence of the curvature on the phase transition is considered. "
"We consider a Pauli particle in a Coulomb field. The supersymmetric Hamiltonian is constructed, by explicitly giving the two supercharges $Q_{1}$ and $ Q_{2}$ in the full three-dimensional space and which together with the Hamiltonian, are shown to constitute an $S(2)$ superalgebra. This offers an alternative way of grouping the energy eigenstates into irreducible representations of this symmetry group of the Hamiltonian. "
"In the first order form, the model considered by Strobl presents, besides local Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariances, an additional local non-linear symmetry. When the model is realized as a Poincar\'e gauge theory according to the procedure outlined in Refs.[1,2], the generators of the non-linear symmetry are responsible for the ``nasty constraint algebra''. We show that not only the Poincar\'e gauge theoretic formulation of the model is not the cause of the emerging of the undesirable constraint algebra, but actually allows to overcome the problem. In fact one can fix the additional symmetry without breaking the Poincar\'e gauge symmetry and the diffeomorphisms, so that, after a preliminary Dirac procedure, the remaining constraints uniquely satisfy the Poincar\'e algebra. After the additional symmetry is fixed, the equations of motion are unaltered. The objections to our method raised by Strobl in Ref.[3] are then immaterial. Some minor points put forward in Ref.[3] are also discussed. "
"Recent work on the classification of conformal field theories with one primary field (the identity operator) is reviewed. The classification of such theories is an essential step in the program of classification of all rational conformal field theories, but appears impossible in general. The last managable case, central charge 24, is considered here. We found a total of 71 such theories (which have not all been constructed yet) including the monster module. The complete list of modular invariant partition functions has already appeared elsewhere \SchM. This paper contains an easily readable account of the method, as well as a few examples and some comments. (This is a compilation of contributions to workshops in Goteborg, Kiev, Corfu and Erice). "
"We relate all $C$-- and $P$--invariant anomalous triple vector--boson couplings to the oblique electroweak parameters. LEP constraints on the latter then yield the strongest and most general simultaneous bounds to date on the former. Even if the oblique parameters assume their Standard Model values precisely, these bounds would not shrink to zero---thus underscoring the need for direct experimental probes at future colliders. "
"Cabibbo-allowed nonleptonic weak decays of charmed baryons $\lamc,~\xin,~\xip$ and $\Omega_c^0$ into an octet baryon and a pseudoscalar meson are analyzed. The nonfactorizable contributions are evaluated under pole approximation, and it turns out that the $s$-wave amplitudes are dominated by the low-lying $\halfm$ resonances, while $p$-wave ones governed by the ground-state $\halfp$ poles. The MIT bag model is employed to calculate the coupling constants, form factors and baryon matrix elements. Our conclusions are: (i) $s$ waves are no longer dominated by commutator terms; the current-algebra method is certainly not applicable to parity-violating amplitudes, (ii) nonfactorizable $W$ exchange effects are generally important; they can be comparable to and somtimes even dominate over factorizable contributions, depending on the decay modes under consideration, (iii) large-$N_c$ approximation for factorizable amplitudes also works in the heavy baryon sector and it accounts for the color nonsuppression of $\lamc\ri p\bar{K}^0$ relative to $\lamc\ri\Lambda\pi^+$, (iv) a measurement of the decay rate and the sign of the $\alpha$ asymmetry parameter of certain proposed decay modes will help discern various models; especially the sign of $\alpha$ in $\lamc\ri\Sigma\pi$ decays can be used to unambiguously differentiate recent theoretical schemes from current algebra, and (v) $p$ waves are the dominant contributions to the decays $\lamc\ri\Xi^0 K^+$ and $\xin\ri\Sigma^+ K^-$, but they are subject to a large cancellation; this renders present theoretical predictions on these two channels unreliable. "
"This is an introduction to conformal invariance and two-dimensional critical phenomena for graduate students and condensed-matter physicists. After explaining the algebraic foundations of conformal invariance, numerical methods and their application to the Ising, Potts, Ashkin-Teller and XY models, tricritical behaviour, the Yang-Lee singularity and the XXZ chain are presented. Finite-size scaling techniques and their conformal extensions are treated in detail. The vicinity of the critical point is studied using the exact $S$-matrix approach, the truncation method, the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and asymptotic finite-size scaling functions. The integrability of the two-dimensional Ising model in a magnetic field is also dealt with. Finally, the extension of conformal invariance to surface critical phenomena is described and an outlook towards possible applications in critical dynamics is given. "
"We describe in detail, in the context of the simple scalar $\phi^4$ theory, the prescription for resummation of daisy and superdaisy diagrams in the effective potential using the solution of the gap equations in the infrared limit. We find that the latter procedure is consistent provided we neglect logarithmic terms from the finite-temperature self energies and from the integration of overlapping momenta. This amounts to dressing only the zero-mode contribution to the finite-temperature effective potential. Improving also the non-zero modes, would require exactly solving (not in the IR limit) the gap equations. In general this can only be done in a theory where all self-energies are momentum independent ({\em e.g.} in the scalar theory at the symmetric phase $\phi=0$). However some partial dressing procedures are still possible in general. "
"We prove an inequality for the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials $K_{\lambda ,\mu}(q)$. As a corollary, we obtain a nontrivial lower bound for the Kostka numbers and a new proof of the Berenstein-Zelevinsky weight-multiplicity-one-criterium. "
"We discuss the relationship between geometry, the renormalization group (RG) and gravity. We begin by reviewing our recent work on crossover problems in field theory. By crossover we mean the interpolation between different representations of the conformal group by the action of relevant operators. At the level of the RG this crossover is manifest in the flow between different fixed points induced by these operators. The description of such flows requires a RG which is capable of interpolating between qualitatively different degrees of freedom. Using the conceptual notion of course graining we construct some simple examples of such a group introducing the concept of a ``floating'' fixed point around which one constructs a perturbation theory. Our consideration of crossovers indicates that one should consider classes of field theories, described by a set of parameters, rather than focus on a particular one. The space of parameters has a natural metric structure. We examine the geometry of this space in some simple models and draw some analogies between this space, superspace and minisuperspace. "
"We examine dimension-six extensions of the standard electroweak Lagrangian which are invariant under local \suu -transformations. The dimension-four trilinear and quadrilinear effective interactions of the vector bosons with one another are found to coincide with the vector boson interactions previously derived from global SU(2) weak isospin symmetry broken by electromagnetism. Supplementing the model by a well-known dimension-six single-parameter quadrupole interaction leads to the most general vector boson self-couplings that can be obtained by addition of dimension-six terms to the standard Lagrangian. We examine in some detail another SU(2)xU(1)-symmetric interaction which contains W_3-B mixing and modifies both vector boson self-couplings and fermionic interactions. Independently of being strongly constrained by the LEP 1 data, the addition of this interaction to the above-mentioned non-standard ones does not change the form of the trilinear and quadrilinear non-standard self-couplings of the vector bosons. Therefore, while being interesting in itself with respect to LEP~1 physics, this term is irrelevant with respect to the phenomenology of the vector-boson self-interactions. "
"A Theorem is proved which reduces the problem of completeness of orbits of Killing vector fields in maximal globally hyperbolic, say vacuum, space--times to some properties of the orbits near the Cauchy surface. In particular it is shown that all Killing orbits are complete in maximal developements of asymptotically flat Cauchy data, or of Cauchy data prescribed on a compact manifold. This result gives a significant strengthening of the uniqueness theorems for black holes. "
"The effect of strong magnetic fields parallel to GaAs/AlGaAs interface on the subband structure of a 2D electron layer is ivestigated theoretically. The system with two levels occupied in zero magnetic field is considered and the magnetic field induced depletion of the second subband is studied. The confining potential and the electron dispersion relations are calculated self-consistently, the electron- electron interaction is taken into account in the Hartree approximation. "
This is a revised version of gr-qc/9304033 
We investigate a solution of the Weyl invariance conditions in open string theory in 4 dimensions. In the closed string sector this solution is a combination of the SU(2) Wess--Zumino--Witten model and a Liouville theory. The investigation is carried out in the $\sigma$ model approach where we have coupled all massless modes (especially an abelian gauge field via the boundary) and tachyon fields. Neglecting all higher derivatives in the field strength we get an exact result which can be interpreted as a monopole configuration living in non--trivial space time. The masses of both tachyon fields are quantized by $c_{wzw}$ and vanish for $c_{wzw} = 1$. 
It is shown that the Lattice Boltzmann equation for hydrodynamics can be extended in such a way as to describe non-relativistic quantum mechanics. 
"Following the general method discussed in Refs.[1,2], Liouville gravity and the 2 dimensional model of non-Einstenian gravity ${\cal L} \sim curv^2 + torsion^2 + cosm. const.$ can be formulated as ISO(1,1) gauge theories. In the first order formalism the models present, besides the Poincar\'e gauge symmetry, additional local symmetries. We show that in both models one can fix these additional symmetries preserving the ISO(1,1) gauge symmetry and the diffeomorphism invariance, so that, after a preliminary Dirac procedure, the remaining constraints uniquely satisfy the ISO(1,1) algebra. After the additional symmetry is fixed, the equations of motion are unaltered. One thus remarkably simplifies the canonical structure, especially of the second model. Moreover, one shows that the Poincar\'e group can always be used consistently as a gauge group for gravitational theories in two dimensions. "
"Although no asymptotic heavy quark spin symmetry, and even more no flavor symmetry, are expected for systems such as quarkonium, a numerical discussion shows that for some processes and in a preasymptotic region which may roughly include charmonium and bottomonium, the use of the spin-symmetry may be useful in conjunction with chiral symmetry for light hadrons (soft-exchange- approximation regime, SEA). We continue our discussion of hadronic transitions in the SEA-regime by studying in particular chiral breaking transitions such as $~^3P' \to ~^3P\pi^0$, $~^3P\eta$, level splittings and transitions which break both chiral and spin symmetry, such as $\psi ' \to J/\psi \pi^0$, $J/\psi \eta$, and $~^1P_1 \to J/\psi \pi^0$. "
I present a new determination of the total cross section for proton-proton collisions from the recent Akeno results on absorption of the cosmic ray protons in the p-Air collisions. Extrapolation to the SSC energy suggests $\sigma_{tot}(p-p) \approx (160-170) mb$. I also comment on a possible sensitivity of the p-Air cross section determinations to assumptions on the inelasticity of nuclear collisions at high energy. 
"The one-loop effective action corresponding the general model of dilaton gravity given by the Lagrangian $L=-\sqrt{g} \left[ \frac{1}{2}Z(\Phi ) g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \Phi \partial_\nu \Phi + C(\Phi ) R + V (\Phi )\right]$, where $Z(\Phi )$, $ C(\Phi )$ and $V (\Phi )$ are arbitrary functions of the dilaton field, is found. The question of the quantum equivalence of classically equivalent dilaton gravities is studied. By specific calculation of explicit examples it is shown that classically equivalent quantum gravities are also perturbatively equivalent at the quantum level, but only on-shell. The renormalization group equations for the generalized effective couplings $Z(\Phi )$, $ C(\Phi )$ and $V (\Phi )$ are written. An analysis of the equations shows, in particular, that the Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger model is not a fixed point of these equations. "
We present a study of the $SU(3)$ glueball spectrum for all $J^{PC}$ values at lattice spacings down to $a^{-1}=3.73 (6)$ GeV ($\beta=6.4$) using lattices of size up to $32^4$. We extend previous studies and show that the continuum limit has effectively been reached. The number of clearly identified $J^{PC}$ states has been substantially increased. There are no clear signals for spin-exotic glueballs below 3 GeV. A comparison with current experimental glueball candidates is made. 
"We systematically derived hydrodynamic equations and transport coefficients for a class of multi-speed lattice Boltzmann models in D dimensions, using the multi-scale technique. The constitutive relation of physical fluid is recovered by a modified equilibrium distribution in Maxwell-Boltzmann type. With the use of the rest particles and the particle reservoir, we were able to add one degree of freedom into the sound speed of the modeled fluid. When the sound speed is tuned small enough, the compressible region of fluid flow can be reached. An example 2-D model is presented, together with the numerical verification for its transport coefficients. "
"This paper establishes a general framework for describing hybrid dynamical systems which is particularly suitable for numerical simulation. In this context, the data structures used to describe the sets and functions which comprise the dynamical system are crucial since they provide the link between a natural mathematical formulation of a problem and the correct application of standard numerical algorithms. We describe a partial implementation of the design methodology and use this simulation tool for a specific control problem in robotics as an illustration of the utility of the approach for practical applications. "
"The thermal Bogoliubov transformation in thermo field dynamics is generalized in two respects. First, a generalization of the $\alpha$--degree of freedom to tilde non--conserving representations is considered. Secondly, the usual $2\times2$ Bogoliubov matrix is extended to a $4\times4$ matrix including mixing of modes with non--trivial multiparticle correlations. The analysis is carried out for both bosons and fermions. "
"An exact numerical calculation of neutrino emissivity of two and three flavour quark matter have been carried out. We find that the neutrino emissivity obtained from the Iwamoto formula is in qualitative agreement with our calculation for two flavour quark matter. For three flavour case, on the other hand we find that the Iwamoto formula overestimates the numerical values by $\sim$2 orders of magnitude or more for d decay and agrees with the s decay results within a factor of 3-4. The dependence of the emissivity on temperature, strong coupling constant and baryon density is also quite different from the Iwamoto formula. "
"We propose two new realizations of the N=4, $\hat{c}=4$ superconformal system based on the compact and non-compact versions of parafermionic algebras. The target space interpretation of these systems is given in terms of four-dimensional target spaces with non-trivial metric and topology different from the previously known four-dimensional semi-wormhole realization. The proposed $\hat{c}=4$ systems can be used as a building block to construct perturbatively stable superstring solutions with covariantized target space supersymmetry around non-trivial gravitational and dilaton backgrounds. "
"(some errors corrected, slightly extended) "
"We have tested Haldane's ``fractional-Pauli-principle'' description of excitations around the $\nu = 1/3$ state in the FQHE, using exact results for small systems of electrons. We find that Haldane's prediction $\beta = \pm 1/m$ for quasiholes and quasiparticles, respectively, describes our results well with the modification $\beta_{qp} = 2-1/3$ rather than $-1/3$. We also find that this approach enables us to better understand the {\it energetics\/} of the ``daughter'' states; in particular, we find good evidence, in terms of the effective interaction between quasiparticles, that the states $\nu = 4/11$ and 4/13 should not be stable. "
"We show that the leading double spectral density in sum rules for Compton-like processes can be obtained by simple properties of the Borel transform, extending an approach widely used in the literature on sum rules, and known to be valid only for the spectral densities of form factors. The extension is illustrated in the scalar case, where it is shown to be consistent with Cutkosky rules. Using arguments based on the analiticity properties of the vertex and the box diagrams, we show that Compton scattering is, however, a favourable case and indeed possible disagreements between the two methods are likely to be encountered in more general situations. "
"The possibility that the interactions of the third generation of quarks and leptons may violate universality by a small amount remains an open experimental question. The model of Li and Ma, which naturally accommodates such violations, is found to be highly constrained by newly obtained, high precision electroweak and $\tau$-lepton data once full Standard Model radiative corrections are incorporated into the analysis. A comparison of the predictions of this model with existing data and the expectations for future colliders is presented. "
"We examine several phenomena beyond the scope of Fermi-gas models that affect the quasielastic scattering (from oxygen) of neutrinos in the 0.1 -- 3.0 GeV range. These include Coulomb interactions of outgoing protons and leptons, a realistic finite-volume mean field, and the residual nucleon-nucleon interaction. None of these effects are accurately represented in the Monte Carlo simulations used to predict event rates due to $\mu$ and $e$ neutrinos from cosmic-ray collisions in the atmosphere. We nevertheless conclude that the neglected physics cannot account for the anomalous $\mu$ to $e$ ratio observed at Kamiokande and IMB, and is unlikely to change absolute event rates by more than 10--15\%. We briefly mention other phenomena, still to be investigated in detail, that may produce larger changes. "
"Starting from the expression for the superdeterminant of (xI-M), where M is an arbitrary supermatrix, we propose a definition for the corresponding characteristic polynomial and we prove that each supermatrix satisfies its characteristic equation. Depending upon the factorization properties of the basic polynomials whose ratio defines the above mentioned determinant we are able to construct polynomials of lower degree which are also shown to be annihilated by the supermatrix. Some particular cases and examples are considered. "
"Wavelet based algorithms in numerical analysis are similar to other transform methods in that vectors and operators are expanded into a basis and the computations take place in this new system of coordinates. However, due to the recursive definition of wavelets, their controllable localization in both space and wave number (time and frequency) domains, and the vanishing moments property, wavelet based algorithms exhibit new and important properties. For example, the multiresolution structure of the wavelet expansions brings about an efficient organization of transformations on a given scale and of interactions between different neighbouring scales. Moreover, wide classes of operators which naively would require a full (dense) matrix for their numerical description, have sparse representations in wavelet bases. For these operators sparse representations lead to fast numerical algorithms, and thus address a critical numerical issue. We note that wavelet based algorithms provide a systematic generalization of the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) and its descendents. These topics will be the subject of the lecture. Starting from the notion of multiresolution analysis, we will consider the so-called non-standard form (which achieves decoupling among the scales) and the associated fast numerical algorithms. Examples of non-standard forms of several basic operators (e.g. derivatives) will be computed explicitly. "
We show the factorization of correlation functions of tachyon operators in 2D string theory using the discretized approach of Moore. Our demonstration of the factorization is more general than that of the paper of Sakai and Tanii. We obtain the rules for the factorization of tachyon amplitudes. Our results can be understood in terms of the operator product expansion of tachyon operators. We also give a systematic way of computing correlation functions of tachyon operators and succeed in summarizing the results of the computation in compact form for some simple cases. We confirm that these tachyon amplitudes indeed satisfy our factorization rule. 
"We consider modifications to general relativity due to non-local string effects by using perturbation theory about the 4-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole metric. In keeping with our interpretation in previous works of black holes as quantum p-branes we investigate non-local effects due to a critical bosonic string compactified down to 4 dimensions. We show that non-local effects do not alter the spacetime topology (at least perturbatively), but they do lead to violations of the area law of black hole thermodynamics and to Hawking's first law of black hole thermodynamics. We also consider a simple analytic continuation of our perturbaive result into the non-perturbative region, which yields an ultraviolet-finite theory of quantum gravity. The Hawking temperature goes to zero in the non-perturbative region (zero string tension parameter), which is consistent with the view that Planck-size physics is quantum mechanical. "

"The detection of an intermediate mass charged Higgs boson at $\gamgam$ colliders via the modes $\gamgam \to H^+ H^- \to \nu \tau^+ \bar{\nu} \tau^-,~ c \bar{s} \bar{c} s,~$ and $ \nu \tau^+ \bar{c}s + c \bar{s} \bar{\nu} \tau^-$ is considered. $W^+ W^-$ boson pair production is the dominant background for these modes. The three modes may be used in a complementary fashion to detect a charged Higgs boson. The mixed leptonic-hadronic mode may be used to determine the charged Higgs mass by reconstructing the invariant hadronic mass. The sensitivity of Br$(H^+ \rightarrow c\bar s,\,\nu \tau^+)$ on the discovery limit of the charged Higgs boson is also discussed. "
"We consider the predictions of chiral perturbation theory for $SU(3)$ breaking in weak semileptonic and $s$-wave nonleptonic hyperon decays. By defining an expansion sensitive only to $SU(3)$ breaking, we show that the leading corrections give rise to moderate corrections to $SU(3)$ relations ($\lsim 20\%$), even though the {\it chiral} symmetry $SU(3) \times SU(3)$ appears to be rather badly broken. This explains why $SU(3)$ fits to weak hyperon decays work well even though chiral-symmetry breaking corrections are large. Applying these $SU(3)$-breaking corrections to the analysis of the EMC data, we find that the predicted value of $\bra p\mybar s\gamma_\mu\gamma_5 s\ket p$ is reduced by $\simeq 35\%$, suggesting that the ``EMC effect'' may be less striking than commonly thought. "
"We calculate the perturbative correction to every cluster coefficient of a gas of anyons through second order in the anyon coupling constant, as described by Chern-Simons field theory. "
"I show that anomaly cancellation conditions are sufficient to determine the two most important topological numbers relevant for Calabi-Yau compactification to six dimensions. This reflects the fact that K3 is the only non-trivial CY manifold in two complex dimensions. I explicitly construct the Green-Schwarz counterterms and derive sum rules for charges of additional enhanced U(1) factors and compare the results with all possible Abelian orbifold constructions of K3. This includes asymmetric orbifolds as well, showing that it is possible to regain a geometrical interpretation for this class of models. Finally, I discuss some models with a broken $E_7$ gauge group which will be useful for more phenomenological applications. "
"An earlier construction by the authors of sequences of globally regular, asymptotically flat initial data for the Einstein vacuum equations containing trapped surfaces for large values of the parameter is extended, from the time symmetric case considered previously, to the case of maximal slices. The resulting theorem shows rigorously that there exists a large class of initial configurations for non-time symmetric pure gravitational waves satisfying the assumptions of the Penrose singularity theorem and so must have a singularity to the future. "
"We study moduli spaces of nonlinear sigma-models on Calabi-Yau manifolds, using the one-loop semiclassical approximation. The data being parameterized includes a choice of complex structure on the manifold, as well as some ``extra structure'' described by means of classes in H^2. The expectation that this moduli space is well-behaved in these ``extra structure'' directions leads us to formulate a simple and compelling conjecture about the action of the automorphism group on the K\""ahler cone. If true, it allows one to apply Looijenga's ``semi-toric'' technique to construct a partial compactification of the moduli space. We explore the implications which this construction has concerning the properties of the moduli space of complex structures on a ``mirror partner'' of the original Calabi-Yau manifold. We also discuss how a similarity which might have been noticed between certain work of Mumford and of Mori from the 1970's produces (with hindsight) evidence for mirror symmetry which was available in 1979. [The author is willing to mail hardcopy preprints upon request.] "
"The nonlinear chiral extension of colour dielectric model has been used in the present work to study the properties of quark stars. Assuming that the square of meson fields develop nonzero expectation value, the thermodynamic potential for charge neutral interacting two and three flavour quark matter, in beta equilibrium, has been calculated up to second order in quark gluon interaction term in the Lagrangian. The equation of state has been found to be softer for higher quark masses and interaction strength. The quark stars properties are found to be dependent on EOS. The mass, radius, moment of inertia and gravitational red shift decrease as the equation of state becomes more soft. "
"Using the self-dual lattice method, we make a systematic search for modular invariant partition functions of the affine algebras $g\*{(1)}$ of $g=A_2$, $A_1+A_1$, $G_2$, and $C_2$. Unlike previous computer searches, this method is necessarily complete. We succeed in finding all physical invariants for $A_2$ at levels $\le 32$, for $G_2$ at levels $\le 31$, for $C_2$ at levels $\le 26$, and for $A_1+A_1$ at levels $k_1=k_2\le 21$. This work thus completes a recent $A_2$ classification proof, where the levels $k=3,5,6,9,12,15,21$ had been left out. We also compute the dimension of the (Weyl-folded) commutant for these algebras and levels. "
"The relativistic Toda lattice equation is decomposed into three Toda systems, the Toda lattice itself, B\""acklund transformation of Toda lattice and discrete time Toda lattice. It is shown that the solutions of the equation are given in terms of the Casorati determinant. By using the Casoratian technique, the bilinear equations of Toda systems are reduced to the Laplace expansion form for determinants. The $N$-soliton solution is explicitly constructed in the form of the Casorati determinant. "
"Properties of the simplest class of self-similar potentials are analyzed. Wave functions of the corresponding Schr\""odinger equation provide bases of representations of the $q$-deformed Heisenberg-Weyl algebra. When the parameter $q$ is a root of unity the functional form of the potentials can be found explicitly. The general $q^3=1$ and the particular $q^4=1$ potentials are given by the equianharmonic and (pseudo)lemniscatic Weierstrass functions respectively. "
"Using a recent next-to-leading-order calculation of the photoproduction double differential cross section for heavy quarks, we study the possibility of extracting the gluon density of the proton from heavy-quark photoproduction data. We discuss the theoretical uncertainties connected with this method, and we conclude that they are well under control in a wide $x$ domain. "
"A semiclassical analysis is made of the origin of an undulating pattern in the smoothed level density for a reflection-asymmetric superdeformed oscillator potential. It is suggested that, when the octupole-type deformation increases, an interference effect between two families of periodic orbit with the ratio of periods approximately 2:1 becomes stronger and thus a pronounced ``supershell'' structure appears. "
"Low-lying excited states of the spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with an impurity bond are investigated in terms of domain-wall excitations by means of analytical methods as well as a method of numerical diagonalization. It is shown that 1) the impurity bond brings about a massive triplet mode in the Haldane gap, 2) the triplet state comprises three of the four ground states of an open chain, 3) the excited states with the domain wall trapped at the impurity bond, including the massive triplet mode, exhibit a N\'eel-type configuration of the magnetic moment around the impurity bond. On the basis of the present results, we propose a new energy versus magnetic-field diagram. "
"We examine the quantization of the motion of two charged vortices in a Ginzburg--Landau theory for the fractional quantum Hall effect recently proposed by the first two authors. The system has two second-class constraints which can be implemented either in the reduced phase space or Dirac-Gupta-Bleuler formalism. Using the intrinsic formulation of statistics, we show that these two ways of implementing the constraints are inequivalent unless the vortices are quantized with conventional statistics; either fermionic or bosonic. "
We described a $q$-deformation of a quantum dynamics in one dimension. We prove that there exists only one essential deforamtion of quantum dynamics. 
"Instead of using a simple reggeon-exchange model, we provide a model-independent estimate of high-energy contribution to the Adler-Weisberger sum-rule. Results and conclusions of the paper remain unchanged. "
"The one-Higgs-doublet standard model is necessarily incomplete because of the triviality of the scalar symmetry-breaking sector. If the Higgs mass is approximately 600 GeV or higher, there must be additional dynamics at a scale $\Lambda$ which is less than a few TeV. In this case the properties of the Higgs resonance can differ substantially from those predicted by the standard model. In this letter we construct an effective Lagrangian description of a theory with a non-standard Higgs boson and analyze the features of a theory with such a resonance coupled to the Goldstone Bosons of the breaking of $\su$. This Lagrangian describes the most general theory in which the Higgs and the Goldstone Bosons are the only particles with a mass small compared to $\Lambda$. We compute the leading corrections to the decay width of the Higgs boson and the contribution to the Peskin-Takeuchi parameter $S$ and present results for the corrections to Goldstone Boson scattering. We find that the most prominent effects are due to one new parameter, which is directly related to the Higgs boson width. "
"The theory of the perturbative pomeron, due to Lipatov and collaborators, is used to compute the probability of observing parton-parton elastic scattering and rapidity gaps between jets in hadron collisions at very high energies. "
All classical Lie algebras can be realized \`a la Schwinger in terms of fermionic oscillators. We show that the same can be done for their $q$-deformed counterparts by simply replacing the fermionic oscillators with anyonic ones defined on a two dimensional lattice. The deformation parameter $q$ is a phase related to the anyonic statistical parameter. A crucial r\^ole in this construction is played by a sort of bosonization formula which gives the generators of the quantum algebras in terms of the underformed ones. The entire procedure works even on one dimensional chains; in such a case $q$ can also be real. 
"In minimal SUSY-GUT models with $M_{SUSY}\ltap 1$ TeV, the renormalization group equations have a solution dominated by the infrared fixed point of the top Yukawa coupling. This fixed point predicts $m_t=(200\; {\rm GeV})\sin \beta $; combined with the LEP results it excludes $m_t\ltap 130$ GeV. For $m_t$ in the range 130-160 GeV, we discuss the sensitivity of the $m_t$ fixed point result to GUT threshold corrections and point out the implications for Higgs boson searches. The lightest scalar $h$ has mass 60-85 GeV and will be detectable at LEPII. At SSC/LHC, each of the five scalars $h$, $H$, $A$, $H^{\pm }$ may be detectable, but not all of them together; in one parameter region none will be detectable. "
"The electric dipole response of the halo nucleus $^{11}$Li is calculated in a hyperspherical three-body formulation, and is studied as a function of the interaction employed for $n-^9$Li to reflect the Pauli principle. Strength concentrations at lower energies are found but no narrow resonances. Only one possible scenario of $^{11}$Li structure is in close correspondence with MSU and RIKEN experimental data. "
"The statistics of $q$-oscillators, quons and to some extent, of anyons are studied and the basic differences among these objects are pointed out. In particular, the statistical distributions for different bosonic and fermionic $q$-oscillators are found for their corresponding Fock space representations in the case when the hamiltonian is identified with the number operator. In this case and for nonrelativistic particles, the single-particle temperature Green function is defined with $q$-deformed periodicity conditions. The equations of state for nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic bosonic $q$-gases in an arbitrary space dimension are found near Bose statistics, as well as the one for an anyonic gas near Bose and Fermi statistics. The first corrections to the second virial coefficients are also evaluated. The phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation in the $q$-deformed gases is also discussed. "
"We discuss the restricted linear group in infinite dimensions modeled by the Schatten class of rank $2p=4$ which contains $(3+1)$-dimensional analog of the loop groups and is closely related to Yang-Mills theory with fermions in $(3+1)$-dimensions. We give an alternative to the construction of the ``highest weight'' representation of this group found by Mickelsson and Rajeev. Our approach is close to quantum field theory, with the elements of this group regarded as Bogoliubov transformations for fermions in an external Yang-Mills field. Though these cannot be unitarily implemented in the physically relevant representation of the fermion field algebra, we argue that they can be implemented by sesquilinear forms, and that there is a (regularized) product of forms providing an appropriate group structure. On the Lie algebra level, this gives an explicit, non-perturbative construction of fermion current algebras in $(3+1)$ space-time dimensions which explicitly shows that the ``wave function renormalization'' required for a consistent definition of the currents and their Lie bracket naturally leads to the Schwinger term identical with the Mickelsson-Rajeev cocycle. Though the explicit form of the Schwinger term is given only for the case $p=2$, our arguments apply also to the restricted linear groups modeled by Schatten classes of rank $2p=6,8,\ldots$ corresponding to current algebras in $(d+1)$- dimensions, $d=5,7,\ldots$. "
"The 331 model offers an explanation of flavor by anomaly cancellation between three families. It predicts three exotic quarks, $Q=D$, $S$, $T$, and five extra gauge bosons comprising an additional neutral $Z_2$ and four charged dileptonic gauge bosons $(Y^{--},Y^-)$, $(Y^{++},Y^+)$. Production of $Q\overline{Q}$, $QY$, $YY$ and $Z_2$ at the SSC is calculated, and signatures are discussed. "
The coefficient of the O(a)-improved Sheikholeslami-Wohlert action for Wilson fermions are perturbatively determined at one-loop level and estimated at two-loop level. 
We review some aspects of the non-perturbative formulation of 2-dim. string theory in terms of non-relativistic fermions. We derive the bosonization using $W_\infty$ coherent states in the path-integral formulation. We discuss the classical limit and indicate the precise nature of the truncation of the full theory that leads to collective field theory. As applications we briefly discuss classical solutions reponsible for stringy non-perturbative effects and the 2-dim. black-hole. 
We studies the high energy elastic scattering of quark anti-quark with an exchange of a mesonic state in the $t$ channel with $-t/\Lambda^{2} \gg 1$. Both the normalization factor and the Regge trajectory can be calculated in PQCD in cases of fixed (non-running) and running coupling constant. The dependence of the Regge trajectory on the coupling constant is highly non-linear and the trajectory is of order of $0.2$ in the interesting physical range. 
"Karolyhazy's hazy space-time model, invented for breaking down macroscopic interferences, employs wave-like gravity disturbances. If so, then electric charges would radiate permanently. Here we discuss the observational consequences of the radiation. We find that such radiation is excluded by common experimental situations. "
We study lateral tunneling through a quantum box including electron-electron interactions in the presence of a magnetic field which breaks single particle degeneracies. The conductance at zero temperature as a function of the Fermi energy in the leads consists of a set of peaks related to changing by one the electron occupancy in the box. We find that the position and heights of the peaks are controlled by many-body effects. We compute the conductance up to 8 electrons for several cases where correlation effects dominate. In the range of intermediate fields spin selection rules quench some peaks. At low and high fields the behavior of the conductance as a function of the number of electrons is very different due to big changes in the many-body ground state wavefunctions. 
Elliptic diagonal solutions for the reflection matrices associated to the elliptic $R$ matrix of the eight vertex free fermion model are presented. They lead through the second derivative of the open chain transfer matrix to an XY hamiltonian in a magnetic field which is invariant under a quantum deformed Clifford--Hopf algebra. 
"Coulomb effects on the edge states of a two dimensional electron gas in the presence of a high magnetic field are studied for different widths of the boundaries. Schr\""odinger and Poisson equations are selfconsistently solved in the integer Quantum Hall regime. Regions of flat bands at the Fermi level appear for smooth interfaces in order to minimize the electrostatic energy related to the existence of dipoles induced by the magnetic field. These plateaus determine the phase separation in stripes of compressible and incompressible electron liquids. "
"Recent numerical results on the fractal structure of two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to $c=-2$ matter are reviewed. Analytic derivation of the fractal dimensions based on the Liouville theory and diffusion equation is also discussed. Excellent agreements between the numerical and theoretical results are obtained. Some problems on the non-universal nature of the fractal structure in the continuum limit are pointed out. ============================================================================ This is a review paper on \lq\lq Fractal Structure of Quantum Gravity in Two Dimension. Talk given at Nishinomiya-Yukawa Simposium, Nov. 1992. Figures are available from the author directly as hard copies. "
"We construct BRST operators for certain higher-spin extensions of the Virasoro algebra, in which there is a spin-$s$ gauge field on the world sheet, as well as the spin-2 gauge field corrresponding to the two-dimensional metric. We use these BRST operators to study the physical states of the associated string theories, and show how they are related to certain minimal models. "
We investigate the magnetic field behaviour of an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1 chain with the most general single-ion anisotropy. We discuss the regime in which the magnetic field is below the transition value. The splitting of the Haldane triplet is obtained as a function of a field applied in an arbitrary orientation by means of a Lancz\H os exact diagonalization of chains of up to 16 spins. Our results are nicely summarized in terms of a first-order perturbation theory. We explain various level crossings that occur by the existence of discrete symmetries. A discussion is given of the electron spin resonance and neutron scattering experiments on the compound Ni(C$_2$H$_8$N$_2$)$_2$NO$_2$ClO$_4$ (NENP). 
"Typical nuclear equations of state and a quark bag model, surprisingly, allow compact stars with alternate layers of neutrons and quarks. One can determine on the basis of the Gibbs free energy which phase, nuclear or quark, is energetically favorable. Using the nuclear equation of state of Wiringa, and a quark equation of state given by Freedman and McLerran, the allowed quark parameter space for such layer stars is searched. This paper differs from past work in that configurations are found in which quark matter is located exterior and interior to shells of nuclear matter, i.e., dependent on quark parameters, a star may contain several alternating layers of quark and nuclear matter. Given the uncertainty in the quark parameter space, one can estimate the probability for finding pure neutron stars, pure quark stars (strange stars), stars with a quark core and a nucleon exterior, or layer stars. Several layer models are presented. The physical characteristics, stability, and results of a thorough search of the quark parameter space are presented. "
"The $q^2$ dependence of the $\rho-\omega$ mixing amplitude is analyzed with the use of the QCD sum rules and the dispersion relation. Going off shell the mixing decreases, changes sign at $q^2 \simeq 0.4 m_{\rho}^2 > 0$ and is negative in the space like region. Implications of this result to the isospin breaking part of the nuclear force are discussed. "
"We pursue the study of families of functions on the natural numbers, with emphasis here on the bounded families. The situation being more complicated than the unbounded case, we attack the problem by classifying the families according to their bounding and dominating numbers, the traditional scheme for gaps. Many open questions remain. "
"We give a new interpretation and proof of the dilogarithm identities, associated to the affine Kac-Moody algebra sl(2)^, using the path description of the corresponding crystal basis. We also discuss connections with algebraic K-theory. "
"Effects on C$_{60}$ by thermal fluctuations of phonons, misalignment of C$_{60}$ molecules in a crystal, and other intercalated impurities (remaining C$_{70}$, oxygens, and so on) are simulated by disorder potentials. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger--type electron-phonon model for doped C$_{60}$ is solved with gaussian bond disorders and also with site disorders. Sample average is performed over sufficient number of disorder configurations. The distributions of bond lengths and electron densities are shown as functions of the disorder strength and the additional electron number. Stability of polaron excitations as well as dimerization patterns is studied. Polarons and dimerizations in lightly doped cases (C$_{60}^{-1,-2}$) are relatively stable against disorders, indicated by peak structures in distribution functions. In more heavily doped cases, the several peaks merge into a single peak, showing the breakdown of polaron structures as well as the decrease of the dimerization strength. Possibility of the observation of polaronic lattice distortions and electron structures in doped C$_{60}$ is discussed. "
"A purely left-chiral model of the weak interactions is used to show that the total parity-violating asymmetry in quark-quark scattering must grow with increasing energy. In the absence of other new physics, non-observation of a large asymmetry can therefore be used to infer an upper bound on the mass scale for new right-chiral weak vector bosons. Applying this idea to actual nucleon-nucleon scattering requires more involved calculations, as the dominant contribution appears to come from a component of diquark-quark scattering related to, but not identical to, wavefunction-mixing. Earlier criticism of this model by Simonius and Unger is refuted and a new calculation is proposed as an additional check on the result. Finally, we argue that the so-called `spin crisis' does not affect our conclusions. (Talk given at the BNL workshop on future directions in particle and nuclear physics at multi-GeV hadron beam facilities, March 4--6, 1993.) "
"If supersymmetry exists at low energies, it is necessary to understand why the squark spectrum exhibits sufficient degeneracy to suppress flavor changing neutral currents. In this note, we point out that gauged horizontal symmetries can yield realistic quark mass matrices, while at the same time giving just barely enough squark degeneracy to account for neutral $K$-meson phenomenology. This approach suggests likely patterns for squark masses, and indicates that there could be significant supersymmetric contributions to $B-\bar{B}$ and $D-\bar{D}$ mixing and CP violation in the $K$ and $B$ systems. "
"We study the renormalization group flow properties of the Wess-Zumino-Witten model in the region of couplings between $g^2=0$ and $g^2=4\pi/k$, by evaluating the two-loop Zamolodchikov's $c$-function. We also discuss the region of negative couplings. "
"We discuss topological Landau-Ginzburg theories coupled to the 2-dimensional topological gravity. We point out that the basic recursion relations for correlation functions of the 2-dimesional gravity have exactly the same form as the Gauss-Manin differential equations for the period integrals of superpotentials. Thus the one-point functions on the sphere of the Landau-Ginzburg theories are given exactly by the period integrals. We discuss various examples, A-D-E minimal models and the $c=3$ topological theories. "
"We calculate the range of eigenfrequencies of radial pulsations of stable strange quark stars, using the general relativistic pulsation equation and adopting realistic equation of state for degenerate strange quark matter. "
"The $G/G$ gauged supergroup valued WZNW theory is considered. It is shown that for $G=\OSP$, the $G/G$ theory tensoring a ($b$, $c$, $\beta$, $\gamma$) system is equivalent to the non-critical fermionic theory. The relation between integral or half integral moded affine superalgebra and its reduced theory, the NS or R superconformal algebra, is discussed in detail. The physical state space, i.e. the BRST semi-infinite cohomology, is calculated, for the $\OSP/\OSP$ theory. "
"Following a suggestion made by Tseytlin, we investigate the case when one replaces the transverse part of the bosonic action by an $n=2$ supersymmetric sigma-model with a symmetric homogeneous K\""ahlerian target space. As conjectured by Tseytlin, the metric is shown to be exactly known since the beta function is known to reduce to its one-loop value. "
"In this note I discuss some aspects of a formulation of quantum mechanics based entirely on the Jordan algebra of observables. After reviewing some facts of the formulation in the \CS -approach I present a Jordan-algebraic Hilbert space construction (inspired by the usual GNS-construction), thereby obtaining a real Hilbert space and a (Jordan-) representation of the algebra of observables on this space. Taking the usual case as a guideline I subsequently derive a Schr\""odinger equation on this Hilbert space. "
"We clarify the notion of the DS --- generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov --- reduction approach to classical ${\cal W}$-algebras. We first strengthen an earlier theorem which showed that an $sl(2)$ embedding ${\cal S}\subset {\cal G}$ can be associated to every DS reduction. We then use the fact that a $\W$-algebra must have a quasi-primary basis to derive severe restrictions on the possible reductions corresponding to a given $sl(2)$ embedding. In the known DS reductions found to date, for which the $\W$-algebras are denoted by ${\cal W}_{\cal S}^{\cal G}$-algebras and are called canonical, the quasi-primary basis corresponds to the highest weights of the $sl(2)$. Here we find some examples of noncanonical DS reductions leading to $\W$-algebras which are direct products of ${\cal W}_{\cal S}^{\cal G}$-algebras and `free field' algebras with conformal weights $\Delta \in \{0, {1\over 2}, 1\}$. We also show that if the conformal weights of the generators of a ${\cal W}$-algebra obtained from DS reduction are nonnegative $\Delta \geq 0$ (which is "
"A strong-weak coupling duality symmetry of the string equations of motion has been suggested in the literature. This symmetry implies that vacua occur in pairs. Since the coupling constant is a dynamical variable in string theory, tunneling solutions between strong and weak coupling vacua may exist. Such solutions would naturally lead to nonperturbative effects with anomalous coupling dependence. A highly simplified example is given. "
"We show that non-oriented coloured polymers (self--avoiding walks with different types of links) are in the same universality class of the ordinary self--avoiding walks, while the oriented coloured are not. "
"We investigate a recently proposed model for a full quantum description of two-dimensional black hole evaporation, in which a reflecting boundary condition is imposed in the strong coupling region. It is shown that in this model each initial state is mapped to a well-defined asymptotic out-state, provided one performs a certain projection in the gravitational zero mode sector. We find that for an incoming localized energy pulse, the corresponding out-going state contains approximately thermal radiation, in accordance with semi-classical predictions. In addition, our model allows for certain acausal strong coupling effects near the singularity, that give rise to corrections to the Hawking spectrum and restore the coherence of the out-state. To an asymptotic observer these corrections appear to originate from behind the receding apparent horizon and start to influence the out-going state long before the black hole has emitted most of its mass. Finally, by putting the system in a finite box, we are able to derive some algebraic properties of the scattering matrix and prove that the final state contains all initial information. "
"We investigate $N=2$ supersymmetric sigma model orbifolds of the sphere in the large radius limit. These correspond to $N=2$ superconformal field theories. Using the equations of topological-anti-topological fusion for the topological orbifold, we compute the generalized Dynkin diagrams of these theories - i.e., the soliton spectrum - which was used in the classification of massive superconformal theories. They correspond to the extended Dynkin diagrams associated to finite subgroups of $SO(3).$ "
"We consider the Statistical Mechanics of systems of particles satisfying the $q$-commutation relations recently proposed by Greenberg and others. We show that although the commutation relations approach Bose (resp.\ Fermi) relations for $q\to1$ (resp.\ $q\to-1$), the partition functions of free gases are independent of $q$ in the range $-1<q<1$. The partition functions exhibit Gibbs' Paradox in the same way as a classical gas without a correction factor $1/N!$ for the statistical weight of the $N$-particle phase space, i.e.\ the Statistical Mechanics does not describe a material for which entropy, free energy, and particle number are extensive thermodynamical quantities. "
"It is shown that that for every Darboux function $F$ there is a non-constant continuous function $f$ such that $F+f$ is still Darboux. It is shown to be consistent --- the model used is iterated Sacks forcing --- that for every Darboux function $F$ there is a nowhere constant continuous function $f$ such that $F+f$ is still Darboux. This answers questions raised by B.~Kirchiem and T.~Natkaniec who have shown that in various models of set theory there are universally bad Darboux functions, Darboux functions whose sum with any nowhere constant, continuous function fails to be Darboux. "
"We explore the one-loop electroweak radiative corrections in the minimal $SU(5)$ and the no-scale flipped $SU(5)$ supergravity models via explicit calculation of vacuum polarization contributions to the $\epsilon_{1,2,3}$ parameters. Experimentally, $\epsilon_{1,2,3}$ are obtained from a global fit to the LEP observables, and $M_W/M_Z$ measurements. We include $q^2$-dependent effects which have been neglected in most previous ``model-independent"" analyses of this type. These effects induce a large systematic negative shift on $\epsilon_{1,2,3}$ for light chargino masses ($m_{\chi^\pm_1}\lsim70\GeV$). In agreement with previous general arguments, we find that for increasingly large sparticle masses, the heavy sector of both models rapidly decouples, \ie, the values for $\epsilon_{1,2,3}$ quickly asymptote to the Standard Model values with a {\it light} Higgs ($m_{H_{SM}}\sim100\GeV$). Specifically, at present the $90\%$ CL upper limit on the top-quark mass is $m_t\lsim175\GeV$ in the no-scale flipped $SU(5)$ supergravity model. These bounds can be strengthened for increasing chargino masses in the $50-100\GeV$ interval. In particular, for $m_t\gsim160\GeV$, the Tevatron may be able to probe through gluino($\tilde g$) and squark($\tilde q$) production up to $m_{\tilde g}\approx m_{\tilde q}\approx250\GeV$, exploring at least half of the parameter space in this model. "
"An experiment that would measure non--commuting quantum mechanical observables without collapsing the wave function has been recently proposed by Y Aharonov and J Anandan. These authors argue that this ""protected measurement"" may give indication on ""the reality of the wave function"". We argue that, depending of the precise version of the experiment considered, either the author's prediction is incorrect and the wave function does collapse, or the measurement is not a measurement on a quantum system. In either case, the experiment does not provide a way for measuring non--commuting observables without collapse, and it does not bear on the issue of the ""reality of the wave function"". "
"Modules over affine Lie superalgebras ${\cal G}$ are studied, in particular, for ${\cal G}=\hat{OSP(1,2)}$. It is shown that on studying Verma modules, much of the results in Kac-Moody algebra can be generalized to the super case. Of most importance are the generalized Kac-Kazhdan formula and the Malikov-Feigin-Fuchs construction, which give the weights and the explicit form of the singular vectors in the Verma module over affine Kac-Moody superalgebras. We have also considered the decomposition of the admissible representation of $\hat{OSP(1,2)}$ into that of $\hat{SL(2)}\otimes$Virasoro algebra, through which we get the modular transformations on the torus and the fusion rules. Different boundary conditions on the torus correspond to the different modings of the current superalgebra and characters or super-characters, which might be relevant to the Hamiltonian reduction resulting in Neveu-Schwarz or Ramond superconformal algebras. Finally, the Felder BRST complex, which consists of Wakimoto modules by the free field realization, is constructed. "
"A variant of Kauffman's model of cellular metabolism is presented. It is a randomly generated network of boolean gates, identical to Kauffman's except for a small bias in favor of boolean gates that depend on at most one input. The bias is asymptotic to 0 as the number of gates increases. Upper bounds on the time until the network reaches a state cycle and the size of the state cycle, as functions of the number of gates $n$, are derived. If the bias approaches 0 slowly enough, the state cycles will be smaller than $n^c$ for some $c<1$. This lends support to Kauffman's claim that in his version of random network the average size of the state cycles is approximately $n^{1/2}$. "
"Recently, Griffiths presented a generalization of the consistent history approach to quantum mechanics. I can easily construct all possible complete families satisfying Griffiths' ""noninterference conditions"". Since only trivial families exist one may conclude that Griffiths' proposal has not got farther than the ordinary theory of quantum measurement. "
"In the Fractional Quantum Hall state, we introduce a bi-local mean field and get vortex mean field solutions. Rotational invariance is imposed and the solution is constructed by means of numerical self-consistent method. It is shown that vortex has a fractional charge, a fractional angular momentum and a magnetic field dependent energy. In $\nu=1/3$ state, we get finite energy gap at $B=10,15,20[T]$. We find that the gap vanishes at $B=5.5[T]$ and becomes negative below it. The uniform mean field becomes unstable toward vortex pair production below $B=5.5[T]$. "
"We develop a general method for power spectrum analysis of three dimensional redshift surveys. We present rigorous analytical estimates for the statistical uncertainty in the power and we are able to derive a rigorous optimal weighting scheme under the reasonable (and largely empirically verified) assumption that the long wavelength Fourier components are Gaussian distributed. We apply the formalism to the updated 1-in-6 QDOT IRAS redshift survey, and compare our results to data from other probes: APM angular correlations; the CfA and the Berkeley 1.2Jy IRAS redshift surveys. Our results bear out and further quantify the impression from e.g.\ counts-in-cells analysis that there is extra power on large scales as compared to the standard CDM model with $\Omega h\simeq 0.5$. We apply likelihood analysis using the CDM spectrum with $\Omega h$ as a free parameter as a phenomenological family of models; we find the best fitting parameters in redshift space and transform the results to real space. Finally, we calculate the distribution of the estimated long wavelength power. This agrees remarkably well with the exponential distribution expected for Gaussian fluctuations, even out to powers of ten times the mean. Our results thus reveal no trace of periodicity or other non-Gaussian behavior. "
"The formation of bound states of holes in an antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 background is studied using numerical techniques applied to the ${\rm t-J}$ Hamiltonian on clusters with up to 26 sites. An analysis of the binding energy as a function of cluster size suggests that a two hole bound state is formed for couplings larger than a ``critical'' value ${\rm J/t]_c}$. The symmetry of the bound state is $\dx2y2$. We also observed that its ``quasiparticle'' weight ${\rm Z_{2h}}$ (defined in the text), is finite for all values of the coupling ${\rm J/t}$. Thus, in the region ${\rm J/t \geq J/t]_c}$ the bound state of two holes behaves like a quasiparticle with charge $Q=2e$, spin $S=0$, and $\dx2y2$ internal symmetry. The relation with recent ideas that have suggested the possibility of d-wave pairing in the high temperature cuprate superconductors is briefly discussed. "
"If massive compact halo objects (\ms) are detected in ongoing searches, then \tsmctlmc, the ratio of the optical depth toward the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, will be a robust indicator of the flattening of the Galactic dark matter halo. For a spherical halo, \tsmctlmc\ is about 1.45, independent of details of the shape of the Galactic rotation curve, the assumed mass of the Galactic disk and spheroid, and the truncation distance (if any) of the dark halo. For an E6 halo (axis ratio $c/a = 0.4$), the ratio of optical depths is \tsmctlmc\ $\sim 0.95$, again independent of assumptions about Galactic parameters. This ratio can be measured with a precision as good as $\sim 10\%$ depending on the typical mass of the MACHOs. If the halo is highly flattened (\eg E6) and closely truncated (\eg at twice the solar galactocentric radius), then the optical depth toward the LMC can be reduced by a factor of about two. For these extreme parameters, and the assumption of a heavy Galactic disk and spheroid, the upper limit of the \m\ mass range to which ongoing experiments are sensitive is reduced from ${\cal O}(10^6)\,M_\odot$ to ${\cal O}(10)\,M_\odot$. "
"We address the problem of constructing the family of (4,4) theories associated with the sigma-model on a parametrized family ${\cal M}_{\zeta}$ of Asymptotically Locally Euclidean (ALE) manifolds. We rely on the ADE classification of these manifolds and on their construction as HyperK\""ahler quotients, due to Kronheimer. So doing we are able to define the family of (4,4) theories corresponding to a ${\cal M}_{\zeta}$ family of ALE manifolds as the deformation of a solvable orbifold ${\bf C}^2 \, / \, \Gamma$ conformal field-theory, $\Gamma$ being a Kleinian group. We discuss the relation among the algebraic structure underlying the topological and metric properties of self-dual 4-manifolds and the algebraic properties of non-rational (4,4)-theories admitting an infinite spectrum of primary fields. In particular, we identify the Hirzebruch signature $\tau$ with the dimension of the local polynomial ring ${\cal R}=\o {{\bf C}[x,y,z]}{\partial W}$ associated with the ADE singularity, with the number of non-trivial conjugacy classes in the corresponding Kleinian group and with the number of short representations of the (4,4)-theory minus four.

"Pairing correlations in rotating nuclei are discussed within the Lipkin-Nogami method. The accuracy of the method is tested for the Krumlinde-Szyma\'nski R(5) model. The results of calculations are compared with those obtained from the standard mean field theory and particle-number projection method, and with exact solutions. "
We glue together two branched spheres by sewing of two Ramond (dual) two-fermion string vertices and present a rigorous analytic derivation of the closed expression for the four-fermion string vertex. This method treats all oscillator levels collectively and the obtained answer verifies that the closed form of the four vertex previously argued for on the basis of explicit results restricted to the first two oscillator levels is the correct one. 
"For generic squark masses, box diagrams with squarks and gluinos give unacceptably large contributions to neutral meson ($K$, $B$ and $D$) mixing. The standard solution to this problem is to assume that squarks are degenerate to a very good approximation. We suggest an alternative mechanism to suppress squark contributions to flavor changing neutral currents: the alignment of quark with squark mass matrices. This mechanism arises naturally in the framework of Abelian horizontal symmetries. "
"The formation of cusps on long cosmic strings is discussed and the probability of cusp formation is estimated. The energy distribution of the gamma-ray background due to cusp annihilation on long strings is calculated and compared to observations. Under optimistic assumptions about the cusp formation rate, we find that strings with a mass per unit length $\mu$ less than ${G\mu} = 10^{-14}$ will have an observable effect. However, it is shown that the gamma-ray bursters can not be attributed to long ordinary strings (or loops). "
"We study the possibility of detecting the Higgs boson in the intermediate mass range via its two jet channel. We consider only Higgs bosons produced in association with a $t \bar{t}$ pair. Both $t$ and $\bar{t}$ are required to decay semileptonically to reduce the QCD background. The signal is compared with the main background, $t \bar{t} + 2$ jets, after appropriate cuts. A sizable signal above background is seen in our simulation at the parton level. Use of the $t\bar{t}Z$ channel with $ Z$ decaying to $l^+ l^-$ is suggested for eliminating theoretical uncertainties in determining the $t \bar{t}H$ signal. "
"We present several topics involving the computation of dynamical systems. The emphasis is on work in progress and the presentation is informal -- there are many technical details which are not fully discussed. The topics are chosen to demonstrate the various interactions between numerical computation and mathematical theory in the area of dynamical systems. We present an algorithm for the computation of stable manifolds of equilibrium points, describe the computation of Hopf bifurcations for equilibria in parametrized families of vector fields, survey the results of studies of codimension two global bifurcations, discuss a numerical analysis of the Hodgkin and Huxley equations, and describe some of the effects of symmetry on local bifurcation. "
"I briefly review the properties of classical affine Toda field theories and indicate how some of this features survive in the quantum theory on-shell. I demonstrate how this knowledge can be extended off-shell, i.e. how to compute correlation functions for completely integrable models via the form factor approach. For the latter I present an axiomatic system and two explicit computation (the Sinh-Gordon theory and the Bullough-Dodd model) which provide a consistent solution of it. (Talk presented at the VII Andr\'e Swieca Summer School, Campos do Jord\~ao, Brasil, 1993) "
"In previous work we have developed a relativistic quark model of mesons which is consistent with all QCD constraints at zeroth and first order in the heavy quark expansion. Here we obtain first order model predictions for the differential decay spectrum, the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$ and the $D^{\ast}$ polarization parameter $\alpha$ in the decay $B\to D^{\ast}\ell\nu$. We compare these with the predictions of QCD sum rules at first order. The model suggests why the corrections allowed at first order are small, concurrently with substantial corrections at second order. "
"We evaluate, in the high-energy limit, $s\gg|t|\gg m^2\gg\lambda^2$, the sum of amplitudes corresponding to a class of Feynman diagrams describing two-loop virtual photonic corrections to Bhabha scattering. The diagrams considered are box and crossed box diagrams with a vacuum polarization insertion in one of the photon lines. "
"The motion of massive test particles in dark matter is studied. It is shown that if the energy density of the dark matter making up a galactic halo has a large $r$ behavior of $1/r^2$, then contrary to intuition the motion of these test particles are not govern by Newtonian gravity, but rather by the equations of geodesic motion from Einstein's theory of general relativity. Moreover, the rotational velocity curves of orbiting massive test particles in this energy density do not approach a constant value at large $r$ but will instead always increase with the radius of the orbit $r_c$. "
"By generalizing the Feynman proof of the Lorentz force law, recently reported by Dyson, we derive equations of motion for particles possessing internal degrees of freedom $I^a$ which do not, in general, generate a finite algebra. We obtain consistency criteria for fields which interact with such particles. It is argued that when a particle with internal $SU_q(2)$ degrees of freedom is coupled to $SU(2)$ gauge fields, $SU(2)$ gauge invariance is broken to $U(1)$. We further claim that when such an $SU_q(2)$ particle acts as a source for the field theory, the second rank antisymmetric field tensor, in general, cannot be globally defined. "
"In this paper we present a mode-matching technique to study the transmission coefficient of mesoscopic devices such as electron waveguides in the presence of high magnetic fields for different situations. A detailed study of the difficulties rising due to the presence of the magnetic field is given and the differences with the zero magnetic field case are stressed. We apply this technique to calculate the transmission at non-zero magnetic field of two completely different systems: a) a quantum box built up on a quantum wire (or electron waveguide) by means of two barriers and b) a meandering quantum wire, {\em i.e.}, a wire with changes in the guiding direction. In the former case we analyze the so-called {\em Coulomb Blockade} and {\em Aharanov-Bohm} regimes and in the latter one we focus on the realistic case of soft, circular bends joining the different sections of the wire. "
"We apply the Green function formalism for $t-\bar t$ production and decay near threshold in a study of the effects due to the momentum dependent width for such a system. We point out that these effects are likely to be much smaller than expected from the reduction of the available phase space. The Lippmann--Schwinger equation for the QCD chromostatic potential is solved numerically for $S$ partial wave. We compare the results on the total cross section, top quark intrinsic momentum distributions and on the energy spectra of $W$ bosons from top quark decays with those obtained for the constant width. "
Relativistic covariance requires that in the constituent quark model for mesons the positive energy states as well as the negative energy states are included. Using relativistic quasi-potential equations the contribution of the negative energy states is studied for the light and charmonium mesons. It is found that these states change the meson mass spectrum significantly but leave its global structure untouched. 
"We study the XY model on a lattice with fluctuating connectivity. The expectation is that at an appropriate critical point such a system corresponds to a compactified boson coupled to 2d quantum gravity. Our simulations focus, in particular, on the important topological features of the system. The results lend strong support to the two phase structure predicted on the basis of analytical calculations. A careful finite size scaling analysis yields estimates for the critical exponents in the low temperature phase. "
The Askey-Wilson algebra $AW(3)$ with three generators is shown to serve as a hidden symmetry algebra underlying the Racah and (new) generalized Clebsch-Gordan problems for the quantum algebra $sl_q(2)$. On the base of this hidden symmetry a simple method to calculate corresponding coefficients in terms of the Askey-Wilson polynomials is proposed. 
"The connection between supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the Korteweg- de Vries (KdV) equation is discussed, with particular emphasis on the KdV conservation laws. It is shown that supersymmetric quantum mechanics aids in the derivation of the conservation laws, and gives some insight into the Miura transformation that converts the KdV equation into the modified KdV equation. The construction of the $\tau$-function by means of supersymmetric quantum mechanics is discussed. "
"Extra symmetries are shown to exist in the effective theory of heavy quarks when both quarks and anti-quarks with the same velocity are included. These symmetries mix the quark with the anti-quark sector and they resemble axial-type of symmetries. Together with the known flavor and spin symmetries they form a $u(4)$ algebra when a single flavor is considered. It is shown that the full $U(4)$ set of symmetries breaks spontaneously down to $ U(2) \otimes U(2)$. The Goldstone modes corresponding to the spontaneously broken currents are identified. Finally, the precise connection of this theory with the fundamental QCD is derived and it is investigated under some approximations. Some physical processes where these extra symmetries may be relevant are pointed out. "
"We make use of the information obtained from semileptonic decays of $B$ and $D$ mesons, within an effective lagrangian description based on heavy quark theory and on chiral expansion, to study the radiative decays $B \to K^\star \gamma$ and $B_S \to \phi\gamma$, and the pair conversion processes $B \to K e^+e^-$ and $B \to K^\star e^+e^-$. We discuss with care the required extrapolations from zero recoils. We obtain a BR($B\to K^\star\gamma$) between $1.3\times 10^{-5}$ and $4.1\times 10^{-5}$ and BR($B_s \to\phi\gamma$) between $1.4\times 10^{-5}$ and $4.5\times 10^{-5}$, with errors mainly arising from the present uncertainty in the Kobayashi-Maskawa element $|V_{ts}|$. For the pair conversion processes we study in particular the lepton effective mass distributions whose measurements would allow for an understanding both long distance and short distance contributions to such processes. "
"We present the general theory of clean, two-dimensional, quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets which are close to the zero-temperature quantum transition between ground states with and without long-range N\'{e}el order. For N\'{e}el-ordered states, `nearly-critical' means that the ground state spin-stiffness, $\rho_s$, satisfies $\rho_s \ll J$, where $J$ is the nearest-neighbor exchange constant, while `nearly-critical' quantum-disordered ground states have a energy-gap, $\Delta$, towards excitations with spin-1, which satisfies $\Delta \ll J$. Under these circumstances, we show that the wavevector/frequency-dependent uniform and staggered spin susceptibilities, and the specific heat, are completely universal functions of just three thermodynamic parameters. Explicit results for the universal scaling functions are obtained by a $1/N$ expansion on the $O(N)$ quantum non-linear sigma model, and by Monte Carlo simulations. These calculations lead to a variety of testable predictions for neutron scattering, NMR, and magnetization measurements. Our results are in good agreement with a number of numerical simulations and experiments on undoped and lightly-doped $La_{2-\delta} Sr_{\delta}Cu O_4$. "
The general $\sigma$-model-type string action including both massless and massive higher spins background fields is suggested. Field equations for background fields are followed from the requirement of quantum Weyl invariance. It is shown that renormalization of the theory can be produced level by level. The detailed consideration of background fields structure and corresponding fields equations is given for the first massive level of the closed bosonic string. 
"This paper is generally concerned with understanding how the uncertainty principle arises in formulations of quantum mechanics, such as the decoherent histories approach, whose central goal is the assignment of probabilities to histories. We first consider histories characterized by position or momentum projections at two moments of time. Both exact and approximate (Gaussian) projections are studied. Shannon information is used as a measure of the uncertainty expressed in the probabilities for these histories. We derive a number of inequalities in which the uncertainty principle is expressed as a lower bound on the information of phase space distributions derived from the probabilities for two-time histories. We go on to consider histories characterized by position samplings at $n$ moments of time. We derive a lower bound on the information of the joint probability for $n$ position samplings. Similar bounds are derived for histories characterized by samplings of other variables. All lower bounds on the information of histories have the general form $\ln \left( V_H / V_S \right) $, where $V_H$ is a volume element of history space, which we define, and $V_S$ is the volume of that space probed by the projections. We thus obtain a concise and general form of the uncertainty principle referring directly to the histories description of the system, and making no reference to notions of phase space. "
"We show how to simulate U(1) gauge fields coupled to three-dimensional quantum gravity and then examine the phase diagram of this system. Quenched mean field theory suggests that a transition separates confined and deconfined phases (for the gauge matter) in both the negative curvature phase and the positive curvature phase of the quantum gravity, but numerical simulations find no evidence for such transitions. "
"The field identification problem, including fixed point resolution, is solved for the non-hermitian symmetric $N=2$ superconformal coset theories. Thereby these models are finally identified as well-defined modular invariant CFTs. As an application, the theories are used as subtheories in tensor products with $c=9$, which in turn are taken as the inner sector of heterotic superstring compactifications. All string theories of this type are classified, and the chiral ring as well as the number of massless generations and anti-generations are computed with the help of the extended Poincare polynomial. Several equivalences between a priori different non-hermitian cosets show up; in particular there is a level-rank duality for an infinite series based on $C$ type Lie algebras. Further, some general results for generic $N=2$ cosets are proven: a simple formula for the number of identification currents is found, and it is shown that the set of Ramond ground states of any $N=2$ coset model is invariant under charge conjugation. "
"Effective Lagrangians containing arbitrary interactions of massive vector fields are quantized within the Hamiltonian path integral formalism. It is proven that correct Hamiltonian quantization of these models yields the same result as naive Lagrangian quantization (Matthews's theorem). This theorem holds for models without gauge freedom as well as for (linearly or nonlinearly realized) spontaneously broken gauge theories. The Stueckelberg formalism, a procedure to rewrite effective Lagrangians in a gauge invariant way, is reformulated within the Hamiltonian formalism as a transition from a second class constrained theory to an equivalent first class constrained theory. The relations between linearly and nonlinearly realized spontaneously broken gauge theories are discussed. The quartically divergent Higgs self interaction is derived from the Hamiltonian path integral. "
"We perform large-space shell-model calculations for the low-lying energy spectra of a few light nuclei, $^4\mbox{He}$, $^5\mbox{He}$, $^6\mbox{Li}$ and $^7\mbox{Li}$, in a no-core model space with a realistic effective two-body interaction (Brueckner G-matrix). Our G-matrices are calculated for the Reid-soft-core potential in a harmonic oscillator basis. Single-particle ``-U'' insertions are replaced by two-particle ``-U'' insertions and are included in the G matrix calculations, which sum them to all orders. With the starting energy of the G-matrix chosen to give approximately the experimental binding energy, we obtain nuclear energy spectra which are in reasonable agreement with experiment. We also investigate the dependence of our results on the size of the model space and on the harmonic oscillator basis parameter ($\hbar\Omega$). "
"We point out two flaws in the recent test of nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials conducted by Stoks and de Swart. First, in some cases, the neutron-proton ($np$) version of an NN potential was compared to the proton-proton ($pp$) data, which is improper and yields (large) $\chi^2$ that are essentially meaningless. Second, for a proper test of the quantitative nature of a NN potential, it is insufficient to compare to $pp$ data only, since this leaves the T=0 potential untested. Thus, it can happen that the $pp$ version of a potential predicts the $pp$ data accurately, while the $np$ version of that same potential is poor in $np$ (where also the T=0 potential is involved). An example for this is the Nijmegen potential, which predicts the $pp$ data well with a $\chi^2$/datum of 2.0, but yields a $\chi^2$/datum of 6.5 in $np$. "
"It is shown that, for any K\""ahler manifold, there exist parametrizations such that the metric takes a block-form identical to the light-cone metric introduced by Polyakov for two-dimensional gravity. Besides its possible relevence for various aspects of K\""ahlerian geometry, this fact allows us to change gauge in W gravities, and explicitly go from the conformal (Toda) gauge to the light-cone gauge using the W-geometry we proposed earlier (this will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming article). "
"In all mass cases needed for quark and gluon self-energies, the two-loop master diagram is expanded at large and small $q^2$, in $d$ dimensions, using identities derived from integration by parts. Expansions are given, in terms of hypergeometric series, for all gluon diagrams and for all but one of the quark diagrams; expansions of the latter are obtained from differential equations. Pad\'{e} approximants to truncations of the expansions are shown to be of great utility. As an application, we obtain the two-loop photon self-energy, for all $d$, and achieve highly accelerated convergence of its expansions in powers of $q^2/m^2$ or $m^2/q^2$, for $d=4$. "
"We formulate a general set of consistency requirements, which are expected to be satisfied by the scattering matrices in the presence of reflecting boundaries. In particular we derive an equivalent to the boostrap equation involving the W-matrix, which encodes the reflection of a particle off a wall. This set of equations is sufficient to derive explicit formulas for $W$, which we illustrate in the case of some particular affine Toda field theories. "
"A common first step in time series signal analysis involves digitally filtering the data to remove linear correlations. The residual data is spectrally white (it is ``bleached''), but in principle retains the nonlinear structure of the original time series. It is well known that simple linear autocorrelation can give rise to spurious results in algorithms for estimating nonlinear invariants, such as fractal dimension and Lyapunov exponents. In theory, bleached data avoids these pitfalls. But in practice, bleaching obscures the underlying deterministic structure of a low-dimensional chaotic process. This appears to be a property of the chaos itself, since nonchaotic data are not similarly affected. The adverse effects of bleaching are demonstrated in a series of numerical experiments on known chaotic data. Some theoretical aspects are also discussed. "
It is shown that Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory has a countable family of static globally regular solutions which are purely magnetic but uncharged. The discrete spectrum of masses of these solutions is bounded from above by the mass of extremal Gibbons-Maeda solution. As follows from linear stability analysis all solutions are unstable. 
"We introduce a lattice Boltzmann computational scheme capable of modeling thermohydrodynamic flows of monatomic gases. The parallel nature of this approach provides a numerically efficient alternative to traditional methods of computational fluid dynamics. The scheme uses a small number of discrete velocity states and a linear, single-time-relaxation collision operator. Numerical simulations in two dimensions agree well with exact solutions for adiabatic sound propagation and Couette flow with heat transfer. "
We give a complete analysis of the projective unitary irreducible representations of the Poincar\'e group in 1+2 dimensions applying Mackey theorem and using an explicit formula for the universal covering group of the Lorentz group in 1+2 dimensions. We provide explicit formulae for all representations. 
Casimir invariants for quantized affine Lie algebras are constructed and their eigenvalues computed in any irreducible highest weight representation. 
"We show that it is possible to measure Schrodinger wave of a single quantum system. This provides a strong argument for associating physical reality with the quantum state of a single system, and challenges the usual assumption that the quantum state has physical meaning only for an ensemble of identical systems. "
"We discuss in some detail the self-similar potentials of Shabat and Spiridonov which are reflectionless and have an infinite number of bound states. We demonstrate that these self-similar potentials are in fact shape invariant potentials within the formalism of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. In particular, using a scaling ansatz for the change of parameters, we obtain a large class of new, reflectionless, shape invariant potentials of which the Shabat-Spiridonov ones are a special case. These new potentials can be viewed as q-deformations of the single soliton solution corresponding to the Rosen-Morse potential. Explicit expressions for the energy eigenvalues, eigenfunctions and transmission coefficients for these potentials are obtained. We show that these potentials can also be obtained numerically. Included as an intriguing case is a shape invariant double well potential whose supersymmetric partner potential is only a single well. Our class of exactly solvable Hamiltonians is further enlarged by examining two new directions: (i) changes of parameters which are different from the previously studied cases of translation and scaling; (ii) extending the usual concept of shape invariance in one step to a multi-step situation. These extensions can be viewed as q-deformations of the harmonic oscillator or multi-soliton solutions corresponding to the Rosen-Morse potential. "
"We carry out the quantization of the full type I and II Bianchi models following the non-perturbative canonical quantization program. These homogeneous minisuperspaces are completely soluble, i.e., it is possible to obtain the general solution to their classical equations of motion in an explicit form. We determine the sectors of solutions that correspond to different spacetime geometries, and prove that the parameters employed to describe the different physical solutions define a good set of coordinates in the phase space of these models. Performing a transformation from the Ashtekar variables to this set of phase space coordinates, we endow the reduced phase space of each of these systems with a symplectic structure. The symplectic forms obtained for the type I and II Bianchi models are then identified as those of the cotangent bundles over ${\cal L}^+_{(+,+)}\times S^2\times S^1$ and ${\cal L}^+_{(+,+)}\times S^1$, respectively. We construct a closed *-algebra of Dirac observables in each of these reduced phase spaces, and complete the quantization program by finding unitary irreducible representations of these algebras. The real Dirac observables are represented in this way by self-adjoint operators, and the spaces of quantum physical states are provided with a Hilbert structure. "
"We obtain new fermionic sum representations for the Virasoro characters of the confromal field theory describing the ferromagnetic three-state Potts spin chain. These arise from the fermionic quasi-particle excitations derived from the Bethe equations for the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian. In the conformal scaling limit, the Bethe equations provide a description of the spectrum in terms of one genuine quasi-particle, and two ``ghost'' excitations with a limited microscopic momentum range. This description is reflected in the structure of the character formulas, and suggests a connection with the integrable perturbation of dimensions (2/3,2/3)$^+$ which breaks the $S_3$ symmetry of the conformal field theory down to $Z_2$. "
"The affine Toda field theories based on the non simply-laced Lie algebras are discussed. By rewriting the S-matrix formulae found by Delius et al, a universal form for the coupling-constant dependence of these models is obtained, and related to various general properties of the classical couplings. This is illustrated via the S-matrix associated with the dual pair of algebras $f_4^{(1)}$ and $e_6^{(2)}$. "
"A bilocal field theory having M\""{o}bius gauge invariance is proposed. In four dimensions there exists a zero momentum state of the first quantized model, which belongs to a non-trivial BRS cohomology class. A field theory lagrangian having a gauge invariance only in four dimensions is constructed. "
"Let $U_q(\hat{\cal G})$ be a quantized affine Lie algebra. It is proven that the universal R-matrix $R$ of $U_q(\hat{\cal G})$ satisfies the celebrated conjugation relation $R^\dagger=TR$ with $T$ the usual twist map. As applications, braid generators are shown to be diagonalizable on arbitrary tensor product modules of integrable irreducible highest weight $U_q(\hat{\cal G})$-module and a spectral decomposition formula for the braid generators is obtained which is the generalization of Reshetikhin's and Gould's forms to the present affine case. Casimir invariants are constructed and their eigenvalues computed by means of the spectral decomposition formula. As a by-product, an interesting identity is found. "
"We examine the effects of hydrodynamics on the late stage kinetics in spinodal decomposition. From computer simulations of a lattice Boltzmann scheme we observe, for critical quenches, that single phase domains grow asymptotically like $t^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha \approx .66$ in two dimensions and $\alpha \approx 1.0$ in three dimensions, both in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. "
"Black hole formation/evaporation in two-dimensional dilaton gravity can be described, in the limit where the number $N$ of matter fields becomes large, by a set of second-order partial differential equations. In this paper we solve these equations numerically. It is shown that, contrary to some previous suggestions, black holes evaporate completely a finite time after formation. A boundary condition is required to evolve the system beyond the naked singularity at the evaporation endpoint. It is argued that this may be naturally chosen so as to restore the system to the vacuum. The analysis also applies to the low-energy scattering of $S$-wave fermions by four-dimensional extremal, magnetic, dilatonic black holes. "
"We do a semiclassical analysis for two or three spins which are coupled antiferromagnetically to each other. The semiclassical wave functions transform correctly under permutations of the spins if one takes into account the Wess-Zumino term present in the path integral for spins. The Wess-Zumino term here is a total derivative which has no effect on the energy spectrum. The semiclassical problem is related to that of anyons moving on a sphere with the statistics parameter $\theta$ being $2 \pi S$ for two spins and $3 \pi S$ for three spins. Finally, we present a novel way of deriving the semiclassical wave functions from the spin wave functions. "
"In these lectures I discuss various unsolved problems of string theory and their relations to quantum gravity, 3d Ising model, large N QCD, and quantum cosmology. No solutions are presented but some new and perhaps useful approaches are suggested. "
"We study the importance of hydrodynamic effects on the evolution of coalescing binary neutron stars. Using an approximate energy functional constructed from equilibrium solutions for polytropic binary configurations, we incorporate hydrodynamic effects into the calculation of the orbital decay driven by gravitational wave emission. In particular, we follow the transition between the quasi-static, secular decay of the orbit at large separation and the rapid dynamical evolution of configurations approaching contact. We show that a purely Newtonian hydrodynamic instability can significantly accelerate the coalescence at small separation. Such an instability occurs in all close binary configurations containing sufficiently incompressible stars. Calculations are performed for various neutron star masses, radii, spins, and effective polytropic indices. Typically, we find that the radial infall velocity just prior to contact is about 10\% of the tangential orbital velocity. Post-Newtonian effects can move the stability limit to a larger binary separation, and may induce an even larger radial velocity. We also consider the possibility of mass transfer from one neutron star to the other. We show that stable mass transfer is impossible except when the mass of one of the components is very small (less than about 0.4 solar mass) and the viscosity is high enough to maintain corotation. "
"We give a wide class of Lie-Poisson systems for which explicit, Lie-Poisson integrators, preserving all Casimirs, can be constructed. The integrators are extremely simple. Examples are the rigid body, a moment truncation, and a new, fast algorithm for the sine-bracket truncation of the 2D Euler equations. "
"We search for rational, four-dimensional maps of standard type (x_{n+1} - 2x_n + x_{n-1} = eps f(x,eps)) possessing one or two polynomial integrals. There are no non-trivial maps corresponding to cubic oscillators, but we find a four-parameter family of such maps corresponding to quartic oscillators. This seems to be the only such example. "
"In a minimal extension of the Standard Model, in which new neutral fermions have been introduced, we show that the requirement of vanishing anomalies fixes the hypercharges of all fermions uniquely. This naturally leads to electric charge quantization in this minimal scenario which has features similar to the Standard Model: invariance under the gauge group $SU(2)_L\otimes U(1)_Y$, conservation of the total lepton number and masslessness for the ordinary neutrinos. Such minimal models might arise as low-energy realizations of some heterotic superstring models or $SO(10)$ grand unified theories. "
"There have been several recent suggestions that the Milky Way has rotating bar-like features based on HI and star count data. In this paper, I show that such features cause distinctive stellar kinematic signatures near OLR and ILR. The effects of these resonances may be observable far from the peak density of the pattern and relatively nearby the solar position. The details of the kinematic signatures depend on the evolutionary history of the `bar' and therefore velocity data, both systemic and velocity dispersion, may be used to probe the evolutionary history as well as the present state of the Galaxy. Kinematic models for a variety of simple scenarios are presented. Models with evolving pattern speeds show significantly stronger dispersion signatures than those with static pattern speeds, suggesting that useful observational constraints are possible. The models are applied to the proposed rotating spheroid and bar models; we find: 1) none of these models chosen to represent the proposed large-scale rotating spheroid are consistent with the stellar kinematics; and 2) a Galactic bar with semimajor axis of $3\kpc$ will cause a large increase in velocity dispersion in the vicinity of OLR ($\sim5\kpc$) with little change in the net radial motion and such a signature is suggested by K-giant velocity data. Potential future observations and analyses are discussed. "
"Inclusive eta production at hadron colliders is considered,based on evaluation of eta fragmentation functions at next to leading order. Absolute predictions at LHC and SSC are presented, including the ratio $\eta/\pi^0$, together with the estimate of the theoretical uncertainty, as a possible neutral background to the $H\to \gamma\gamma$ detection. "
"To detect brown dwarfs in the dark galactic halo through gravitational lensing, experiments follow the luminosity of millions of stars to observe a few lensing events par year. The luminosity of a star too faint to be continuously followed can be temporarily increased above the detection limit by a lensing. The detection of these invisible stars would increase the number of events by a factor 2 to 7, and moreover their presence would confirm the lensing interpretation of events due to continuously monitored stars. "
"Fragmentation of the planetesimals is found to play a role whose importance is greater than previously believed and depends on the average characteristic size of the primordial planetesimals but not on their mass distribution. In the small size range the mass spectrum is strongly modified with the formation of a small bodies tail but, on the other hand, the growth of the most massive objects is significantly slowed down. The formation of planetary embryos much more massive than the rest of the swarm is delayed; nevertheless the time-scale problem for the growth of the outer planets is not revived. "
We calculate the splitting between fermion and anti-fermion effective masses in high temperature gauge theories in the presence of a non-vanishing chemical potential due to the $CP$-asymmetric fermionic background. In particular we consider the case of left-handed leptons in the $SU(2)\otimes U(1)$ theory when the temperature is above $250$ GeV and the gauge symmetry is restored. 
"We study how the effects of quantum corrections lead to notions of irreversibility and clustering in quantum field theory. In particular, we consider the virtual ``charge"" distribution generated by quantum corrections and adopt for it a statistical interpretation. Then, this virtual charge is shown to ($a$) describe a system where the equilibrium state is at its classical limit ($\hbar \rightarrow 0$), ($b$) give rise to spatial diffusion of the virtual cloud that decays as the classical limit is approached and ($c$) lead to a scenario where clustering takes place due to quantum dynamics, and a natural transition from a ``fractal"" to a homogeneous regime occurs as distances increase. "
"Rotators interacting with a pendulum via small, velocity independent, potentials are considered. If the interaction potential does not depend on the pendulum position then the pendulum and the rotators are decoupled and we study the invariant tori of the rotators system at fixed rotation numbers: we exhibit cancellations, to all orders of perturbation theory, that allow proving the stability and analyticity of the dipohantine tori. We find in this way a proof of the KAM theorem by direct bounds of the $k$--th order coefficient of the perturbation expansion of the parametric equations of the tori in terms of their average anomalies: this extends Siegel's approach, from the linearization of analytic maps to the KAM theory; the convergence radius does not depend, in this case, on the twist strength, which could even vanish ({\it ""twistless KAM tori""}). The same ideas apply to the case in which the potential couples the pendulum and the rotators: in this case the invariant tori with diophantine rotation numbers are unstable and have stable and unstable manifolds ({\it ""whiskers""}): instead of studying the perturbation theory of the invariant tori we look for the cancellations that must be present because the homoclinic intersections of the whiskers are {\it ""quasi flat""}, if the rotation velocity of the quasi periodic motion on the tori is large. We rederive in this way the result that, under suitable conditions, the homoclinic splitting is smaller than any power in the period of the forcing and find the exact asymptotics in the two dimensional cases ({\it e.g.} in the case of a periodically forced pendulum). The technique can be applied to study other quantities: we mention, as another example, the {\it homoclinic scattering phase shifts}.} "
"It is frequently useful to construct dual descriptions of theories containing antisymmetric tensor fields by introducing a new potential whose curl gives the dual field strength, thereby interchanging field equations with Bianchi identities. We describe a general procedure for constructing actions containing both potentials at the same time, such that the dual relationship of the field strengths arises as an equation of motion. The price for doing this is the sacrifice of manifest Lorentz invariance or general coordinate invariance, though both symmetries can be realized nonetheless. There are various examples of global symmetries that have been realized as symmetries of field equations but not actions. These can be elevated to symmetries of the action by our method. The main example that we focus on is the low-energy effective action description of the heterotic string theory compactified on a six-torus to four dimensions. We show that the SL(2,R) symmetry, whose SL(2,Z) subgroup has been conjectured to be an exact symmetry of the full string theory, can be realized on the action in a way that brings out a remarkable similarity to the target space duality symmetry O(6,22). Our analysis indicates that SL(2,Z) symmetry may arise naturally in a dual formulation of the theory. "
"A model field theory, in which the interaction between quarks is mediated by dressed vector boson exchange, is used to analyse the pionic sector of QCD. It is shown that this model, which incorporates dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, asymptotic freedom and quark confinement, allows one to calculate $f_\pi$, $m_\pi$, $r_\pi$ and the partial wave amplitudes in $\pi$-$\pi$ scattering and obtain good agreement with the experimental data, with the latter being well described up to energies \mbox{$E\simeq 700$ MeV}. "
"The gauge equivalence between basic KP hierarchies is discussed. The first two Hamiltonian structures for KP hierarchies leading to the linear and non-linear $\Winf$ algebras are derived. The realization of the corresponding generators in terms of two boson currents is presented and it is shown to be related to many integrable models which are bi-Hamiltonian. We can also realize those generators by adding extra currents, coupled in a particular way, allowing for instance a description of multi-layered Benney equations or multi-component non-linear Schroedinger equation. In this case we can have a second Hamiltonian bracket structure which violates Jacobi identity. We consider the reduction to one-boson systems leading to KdV and mKdV hierarchies. A Miura transformation relating these two hierarchies is obtained by restricting gauge transformation between corresponding two-boson hierarchies. Connection to Drinfeld-Sokolov approach is also discussed in the $SL(2,\IR)$ gauge theory. (Lectures presented at the VII J.A. Swieca Summer School, Section: Particles and Fields, Campos do Jord\~ao - Brasil - January/93) "
"The structure of the moduli spaces $\M := \A/\G$ of (all, not just flat) $SL(2,C)$ and $SU(1,1)$ connections on a n-manifold is analysed. For any topology on the corresponding spaces $\A$ of all connections which satisfies the weak requirement of compatibility with the affine structure of $\A$, the moduli space $\M$ is shown to be non-Hausdorff. It is then shown that the Wilson loop functionals --i.e., the traces of holonomies of connections around closed loops-- are complete in the sense that they suffice to separate all separable points of $\M$. The methods are general enough to allow the underlying n-manifold to be topologically non-trivial and for connections to be defined on non-trivial bundles. The results have implications for canonical quantum general relativity in 4 and 3 dimensions. "
"A perturbatively renormalized Abelian Higgs-Kibble model with a chirally coupled fermion is considered. The Slavnov identity is fulfilled to all orders of perturbation theory, which is crucial for renormalizability in models with vector bosons. BRS invariance, i.e. the validity of the identity, forces the chiral anomaly to be cancelled by Wess-Zumino counterterms. This procedure preserves the renormalizability in the one-loop approximation but it violates the Froissart bounds for partial wave amplitudes above some energy and destroys renormalizability from the second order in h bar onwards due to the counterterms. (The paper has 3 figs. in postscript which are not included; send request to the author's e-mailbox with subject: figures . The author is willing to mail hard copies of the paper.) "
"Previously suggested definitions of averagely trapped surfaces are not well-defined properties of 2-surfaces, and can include surfaces in flat space-time. A natural definition of averagely trapped surfaces is that the product of the null expansions be positive on average. A surface is averagely trapped in the latter sense if and only if its area $A$ and Hawking mass $M$ satisfy the isoperimetric inequality $16\pi M^2 > A$, with similar inequalities existing for other definitions of quasi-local energy. "
Mesonic fluctuations off the chiral soliton of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model are investigated. The hedgehog configuration is proven to represent a local extremum of the action. The method is applied to flavor SU(3) and the energy eigenvalue of the kaon bound state in the soliton background is evaluated which is the key ingredient for the Callan-Klebanov approach to hyperons. The energy eigenvalue of the corresponding strange-valence-quark is found to be 183MeV higher than the energy eigenvalue of the up-valence-quark when 400MeV is assumed for the up-quark constituent mass. 
"We present real--space renormalization group (RG) calculations of the critical properties of the random--field Ising model on a cubic lattice in three dimensions. We calculate the RG flows in a two--parameter truncation of the Hamiltonian space. As predicted, the transition at finite randomness is controlled by a zero temperature, disordered critical fixed point, and we exhibit the universal crossover trajectory from the pure Ising critical point. We extract scaling fields and critical exponents, and study the distribution of barrier heights between states as a function of length scale. "
"From the point of view of canonical quantum gravity, it has become imperative to find a framework for quantization which provides a {\em general} prescription to find the physical inner product, and is flexible enough to accommodate non-canonical variables. In this dissertation I consider an algebraic formulation of the Dirac approach to the quantization of constrained systems, due to A. Ashtekar. The Dirac quantization program is augmented by a general principle to find the inner product on physical states. Essentially, the Hermiticity conditions on physical operators determine this inner product. I also clarify the role in quantum theory of possible algebraic identities between the elementary variables. I use this approach to quantize various finite dimensional systems. Some of these models test the new aspects of the algebraic framework. Others bear qualitative similarities to \gr, and may give some insight into the pitfalls lurking in \qg. In (spatially compact) general relativity, the Hamiltonian is constrained to vanish. I present various approaches one can take to obtain an interpretation of the quantum theory of such ``dynamically constrained'' systems. I apply some of these ideas to the Bianchi I cosmology, and analyze the issue of the initial singularity in quantum theory. "
"The appropriate generalization of the isotropic impurity Anderson model for valence fluctuations between two magnetic multiplets $l^n$ and $l^{n+1}$ is solved in the strong-coupling limit of Wilson's renormalization group for $l\leq$ 3. Except in the extreme case of $j-j$ coupling, the ground state is degenerate, the impurity magnetic moment is very small and is overscreened by the conduction electrons. The strong-coupling fixed point turns out to be unstable. Thus, at low enough temperatures the physics of the systems should be governed by an intermediate coupling fixed point and non Fermi-liquid behavior is expected. "
"We perform a numerical calculation of the total cross section $\sigma(e^+e^- \rightarrow W^+W^-)$ as a function of energy, taking into account the finite width of the $W$ and the most important radiative corrections. We present these results, in tabular form, for several values of $M_W$. Using these results, we investigate running strategies for integrated luminosities that might be available at LEP~200 and estimate the accuracy to which it will be possible to determine the mass of the $W$ by measuring this cross section near threshold. With an integrated luminosity of $100\ {\rm pb}^{-1}$ it should be possible to achieve a precision of $100\ {\rm MeV}$, and with an integrated luminosity of $500\ {\rm pb}^{-1}$, a precision of $60\ {\rm MeV}$. "
"We consider the one-dimensional random field Ising model, where the spin-spin coupling, $J$, is ferromagnetic and the external field is chosen to be $+h$ with probability $p$ and $-h$ with probability $1-p$. At zero temperature, we calculate an exact expression for the correlation length of the quenched average of the correlation function $\langle s_0 s_n \rangle - \langle s_0 \rangle \langle s_n \rangle$ in the case that $2J/h$ is not an integer. The result is a discontinuous function of $2J/h$. When $p = {1 \over 2}$, we also place a bound on the correlation length of the quenched average of the correlation function $\langle s_0 s_n \rangle$. "
"We present a definition of the non-abelian generalisations of affine Toda theory related from the outset to vertex operator constructions of the corresponding Kac-Moody algebra $\gh$. Reuslts concerning conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of the finite Lie algebra $\fing$ to embeddings of $A_1$ in $\fing$ are used both to present the theories, and to elucidate their soliton spectrum. We confirm the conjecture of \cite{OSU93} for the soliton specialisation of the Leznov-Saveliev solution. The energy-momentum tensor of such theories is shown to split into a total derivative part and a part dependent only on the free fields which appear in the general solution, and vanish for the soliton solutions. Analogues are provided of the results known for the classical solitons of abelian Toda theories. "
"We study a non linear sigma model $O(N)\otimes O(2)/O(N-2)\otimes O(2)$ describing the phase transition of N-components helimagnets up to two loop order in $D=2+\epsilon$ dimensions. It is shown that a stable fixed point exists as soon as $N$ is greater than 3 (or equal). In the N=3 case, the symmetry of the system is dynamically enlarged at the fixed point to O(4) We show that the order parameter for Heisenberg helimagnets involves a tensor representation of $O(4)$. We show that for large $N$ and in the neighborhood of two dimensions this nonlinear sigma model describes the same critical theory as the Landau-Ginzburg linear theory. We deduce that there exists a dividing line $N_c (D)$ in the plane $(N, D)$ separating a first-order region containing the Heisenberg point at $D=4$ and a second-order region containing the whole $D=2$ axis. We conclude that the phase transition of Heisenberg helimagnets in dimension 3 is either first order or second order with $O(4)$ exponents involving a tensor representation or tricritical. "
"We show that tidal interaction among galaxy clusters can account for their observed alignments and very marked elongation and, consequently, that these characteristics of clusters are actually consistent with them being formed in hierarchical clustering. The well-established distribution of projected axial ratios of clusters with richness class $R\ge 0$ is recovered very satisfactorily by means of a simple model with no free parameters. The main perturbers are relatively rich ($R\ge 1$) single clusters and/or groups of clusters (superclusters) of a wider richness class ($R\ge 0$) located within a distance of about 65 $h^{-1}$ Mpc from the perturbed cluster. This makes the proposed scheme be also consistent with all reported alignment effects involving clusters. We find that this tidal interaction is typically in the saturate regime (\ie the maximum elongation allowed for systems in equilibrium is reached), which explains the very similar intrinsic axial ratio shown by all clusters. Tides would therefore play an important role in the dynamics of large scale structures, in particular, they should be taken into account when estimating the virial mass of clusters. "
"The standard model of particle physics is marvelously successful. However, it is obviously not a complete or final theory. I shall argue here that the structure of the standard model gives some quite concrete, compelling hints regarding what lies beyond. "
We show that instantaneous configurations of 180 degree domain walls constructed on a square lattice in a two-dimensional and S=1/2 Ising-type model exhibit fractal structure. The fractal dimension depends on the coupling parameters and it is a continious function of the temperature. The wall thickness in the neighbourhood of Tc presents scaling properties in good agreement with the classical theory by Landau. 
The induced lattice gauge theory with various types of inducing fields in fundamental representation of $SU(N_{c})$ is considered. In a simple case of one-plaquette lattice the model is solved in the large $N_{c}$ limit by means of loop equations. Comparison with the solution of usual QCD shows the equivalence of induced and Wilson QCD providing that a mass and a number of flavours of inducing fields are sufficiently large. The possibility to take an asymptotically free continuum limit of induced QCD is discussed. 
"Actions for $D=2$, $N=2$ supergravity coupled to a scalar field are calculated, and it is shown that the most general power-counting renormalizable dilaton gravity action has an $N=2$ locally supersymmetric extension. The presence of chiral terms in the action leads one to hope that non-renormalization theorems similar to those in global SUSY will apply; this would eliminate some of the renormalization ambiguities which plague ordinary bosonic (and $N=1$) dilaton gravity. To investigate this, the model is studied in superconformal gauge, where it is found that one chiral term becomes nonchiral, so that only one term is safe from renormalization. "
"In the measurement of a continuous observable Q, the pure components of the reduced state do, in general, depend on the initial state. For measurements which attempt to localize the measured system in a certain region R, the localized wave functions are proportional to the original wave function outside of R. This `quantum memory' effect shows that it is not possible to perfectly localize a quantum particle. "
"We extend the methods of Yennie, Frautschi and Suura to QCD for the summation of soft gluon effects in which infrared singularities are cancelled to all orders in $\alpha_s$. An explicit formula for the respective \rngp improved exponentiated cross section is obtained for $q+\bbar{{q'}}\to q+\bbar{{q'}}+ n(G)$ at SSC energies. Possible applications are discussed. "
"In this short note we show that for a Markovian open quantum system it is always possible to construct a unique set of perfectly consistent Schmidt paths, supporting quasi-classicality. Our Schmidt process, elaborated several years ago, is the $\Delta t\to 0$ limit of the Schmidt chain constructed very recently by Paz and Zurek. "
I present a new way to solve the Wheeler--de Witt equation using the invariance of the classical lagrangian under reparametrization. This property allows one to introduce an arbitrary function for each degree of freedom of the wave function $\Psi$: this arbitrariness can be used to fix the asymptotic behaviour of $\Psi$ so as to obtain a wave function representing a closed universe or a wormhole. These considerations are applied in detail to the Kantowsky--Sachs spacetime. 
"The gravitating matter is studied within the framework of the non-commutative geometry. The non-commutative Einstein-Hilbert action on the product of a four dimensional manifold with a discrete space gives the models of matter fields coupled to the standard Einstein gravity.The matter multiplet is encoded in the Dirac operator which yields the representation of the algebra of the universal forms. The general form of the Dirac operator depends on a choice of the grading of the corresponding spinor bundle. A choice is given, which leads to the nonlinear vector sigma-model coupled to the Einstein gravity. "
"The Isgur-Wise functions for the ground state to ground state semileptonic decays involving $b \rightarrow c$ transitions are calculated from the (modified) MIT bag model. It is checked that the results for the decays $\overline{B} \rightarrow D l \overline\nu$ and $\overline{B} \rightarrow D^* l \overline\nu$ agree well with experiment. Predictions for the decays $\Lambda_b \rightarrow \Lambda_c l \overline\nu$, $\overline{B}_s \rightarrow D_s l \overline\nu$ and $\overline{B}_s \rightarrow D^*_s l \overline\nu$ are given and discussed. "
"An ADM mass formula is derived for a wide class of black solutions with certain spherical symmetry. By applying this formula, we calculate the ADM masses for recently discovered black strings and $p$-branes in diverse dimensions. By this, the Bogolmol'nyi equation can be shown to hold explicitly. A useful observation is made for non-extremal black $p$-branes that only for $p = 0$, i.e. for a black hole, can its ADM mass be read directly from the asymptotic behaviour of the metric component $g_{00}$. "
"We show that the Hilbert space basis that defines the Ponzano-Regge- Turaev-Viro-Ooguri combinatorial definition of 3-d Quantum Gravity is the same as the one that defines the Loop Representation. We show how to compute lengths in Witten's 3-d gravity and how to reconstruct the 2-d geometry from a state of Witten's theory. We show that the non-degenerate geometries are contained in the Witten's Hilbert space. We sketch an extension of the combinatorial construction to the physical 4-d case, by defining a modification of Regge calculus in which areas, rather than lengths, are taken as independent variables. We provide an expression for the scalar product in the Loop representation in 4-d. We discuss the general form of a nonperturbative quantum theory of gravity, and argue that it should be given by a generalization of Atiyah's topological quantum field theories axioms. "
"We show that a cosmological baryon asymmetry generated at the GUT scale, which would be destroyed at lower temperatures by sphalerons and possible new B- or L-violating effects, can naturally be preserved by an asymmetry in the number of right-handed electrons. This results in a significant softening of previously derived baryogenesis-based constraints on the strength of exotic B- or L-violating interactions. "
"The first ``Convegno Informale su Quantum Groups'' was held in Florence from February 3 to 6, 1993. This Convegno was conceived as an informal meeting to bring together all the italian people working in the field of quantum groups and related topics. We are very happy indeed that about 30 theoretical physicists decided to take part presenting many aspects of this interesting and live subject of research. We thank all the participants for the stimulating and nice atmosphere that has characterized the meeting. This paper has the intent to give a quick review in english of the contributions and related references. We think useful to include the complete addresses and coordinate data of the participants. It is our intention to diffuse these proceedings by e-mail trough electronic data banks. "
We introduce a path-dependent hamiltonian representation (the path representation) for SU(2) with fermions in 3 + 1 dimensions. The gauge-invariant operators and hamiltonian are realized in a Hilbert space of open path and loop functionals. We obtain two new types of Mandelstam identities one that connects open path operators with loop operators and other involving the end points of the paths. 
"We discuss solutions of the heterotic string theory which are analogous to bosonic and superstring backgrounds related to coset conformal field theories. A class of exact `left-right symmetric' solutions is obtained by supplementing the metric, antisymmetric tensor and dilaton of the superstring solutions by the gauge field background equal to the generalised Lorentz connection with torsion. As in the superstring case, these backgrounds are $\a'$-independent, i.e. have a `semiclassical' form. The corresponding heterotic string sigma model is obtained from the combination of the (1,0) supersymmetric gauged WZNW action with the action of internal fermions coupled to the target space gauge field. The pure (1,0) supersymmetric gauged WZNW theory is anomalous and does not describe a consistent heterotic string solution. We also find (to the order $\alpha'^3$) a two-dimensional perturbative heterotic string solution with the trivial gauge field background. To the leading order in $\alpha'$ it coincides with the known $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ bosonic or superstring solutions. This solution does not correspond to a `heterotic' combination of the left superstring and right bosonic $L_0$-operators at the conformal field theory level. Some duality properties of the heterotic string solutions are studied. "
"The Cartan-Maurer equations for any $q$-group of the $A_{n-1}, B_n, C_n, D_n$ series are given in a convenient form, which allows their direct computation and clarifies their connection with the $q=1$ case. These equations, defining the field strengths, are essential in the construction of $q$-deformed gauge theories. An explicit expression $\om ^i\we \om^j= -\Z {ij}{kl}\om ^k\we \om^l$ for the $q$-commutations of left-invariant one-forms is found, with $\Z{ij}{kl} \om^k \we \om^l \qonelim \om^j\we\om^i$. "
"Invariant connections with torsion on simple group manifolds $S$ are studied and an explicit formula describing them is presented. This result is used for the dimensional reduction in a theory of multidimensional gravity with curvature squared terms on $M^{4} \times S$. We calculate the potential of scalar fields, emerging from extra components of the metric and torsion, and analyze the role of the torsion for the stability of spontaneous compactification. "
"In this paper the evolution of a quantum system drived by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian depending on slowly-changing parameters is studied by building an universal high-order adiabatic approximation(HOAA) method with Berry's phase ,which is valid for either the Hermitian or the non-Hermitian cases. This method can be regarded as a non-trivial generalization of the HOAA method for closed quantum system presented by this author before. In a general situation, the probabilities of adiabatic decay and non-adiabatic transitions are explicitly obtained for the evolution of the non-Hermitian quantum system. It is also shown that the non-Hermitian analog of the Berry's phase factor for the non-Hermitian case just enjoys the holonomy structure of the dual linear bundle over the parameter manifold. The non-Hermitian evolution of the generalized forced harmonic oscillator is discussed as an illustrative examples. "
"A finite dimensional system with a quadratic Hamiltonian constraint is Dirac quantized in holomorphic, antiholomorphic and mixed representations. A unique inner product is found by imposing Hermitian conjugacy relations on an operator algebra. The different representations yield drastically different Hilbert spaces. In particular, all the spaces obtained in the antiholomorphic representation violate classical expectations for the spectra of certain operators, whereas no such violation occurs in the holomorphic representation. A subset of these Hilbert spaces is also recovered in a configuration space representation. A propagation amplitude obtained from an (anti)holomorphic path integral is shown to give the matrix elements of the identity operators in the relevant Hilbert spaces with respect to an overcomplete basis of representation-dependent generalized coherent states. Relation to quantization of spatially homogeneous cosmologies is discussed in view of the no-boundary proposal of Hartle and Hawking and the new variables of Ashtekar. "
"A Cayley tree model of idiotypic networks that includes both B cell and antibody dynamics is formulated and analyzed. As in models with B cells only, localized states exist in the network with limited numbers of activated clones surrounded by virgin or near-virgin clones. The existence and stability of these localized network states are explored as a function of model parameters. As in previous models that have included antibody, the stability of immune and tolerant localized states are shown to depend on the ratio of antibody to B cell lifetimes as well as the rate of antibody complex removal. As model parameters are varied, localized steady-states can break down via two routes: dynamically, into chaotic attractors, or structurally into percolation attractors. For a given set of parameters, percolation and chaotic attractors can coexist with localized attractors, and thus there do not exist clear cut boundaries in parameter space that separate regions of localized attractors from regions of percolation and chaotic attractors. Stable limit cycles, which are frequent in the two-clone antibody B cell (AB) model, are only observed in highly connected networks. Also found in highly connected networks are localized chaotic attractors. As in experiments by Lundkvist et al. (1989), injection of $Ab_1$ antibodies into a system operating in the chaotic regime can cause a cessation of fluctuations of $Ab_1$ and $Ab_2$ antibodies, a phenomenon already observed in the two-clone AB model. Interestingly, chaotic fluctuations continue at higher levels of the tree, a phenomenon observed by Lundkvist et al. but not accounted for previously. "
"It is shown that it is possible to measure the Schr\""odinger wave of a single quantum system. This provides a strong argument for associating physical reality with a quantum state of a single system in sharp contrast with the usual approach in which the physical meaning of a quantum state is related only to an ensemble of identical systems. An apparent paradox between measurability of a quantum state of a single system and the relativistic causality is resolved. "
"We prove that up to birational equivalence, there exists only a finite number of families of Calabi-Yau threefolds (i.e. a threefold with trivial canonical class and factorial terminal singularities) which have an elliptic fibration to a rational surface. This strengthens a result of B. Hunt that there are only a finite number of possible Euler characteristics for such threefolds. "
"Using the 1-loop reduced 3D action of the Abelian Higgs-model we discuss the order of its finite temperature phase transition. A two-variable saddle point approximation is proposed for the evaluation of the effective potential. The strength of the first order case scales like \sim e^{3-6}. Analytic asymptotic weak coupling and numerical small coupling solutions are compared with special emphasis on the cancellation of divergences. (Figures are not included, can be sent upon request from jako@hercules.elte.hu .) "
"The anisotropy and polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) induced by the scalar and tensor metric perturbations are computed in the long-wavelength limit. It is found that the large-scale polarization of CMBR induced by the decaying tensor mode can reach a few percents. This is different from the scalar or inflation-induced tensor mode, whereas the polarization is at least two orders of magnitude lower. The effect of matter re-ionization on CMBR is also considered. We conclude that measuring the polarization of CMBR on large-angular scales can probe the ionization history of the early Universe, and test different cosmological models. "
"We solve the equations of motion of the tachyon and the discrete states in the background of Witten's semiclassical black hole and in the exact 2D dilaton-graviton background of Dijkgraaf et al. We find the exact solutions for weak fields, leading to conclusions in disagreement with previous studies of tachyons in the black hole. Demanding that a state in the black hole be well behaved at the horizon implies that it must tend asymptotically to a combination of a Seiberg and an anti-Seiberg c=1 state. For such a state to be well behaved asymptotically, it must satisfy the condition that neither its Seiberg nor its anti-Seiberg Liouville momentum is positive. Thus, although the free-field BRST cohomologies of the underlying SL(2,R)/U(1) theory is the same as that of a c=1 theory, the black hole spectrum is drastically truncated: THERE ARE NO W_INFINITY STATES, AND ONLY TACHYONS WITH X-MOMENTA | P_TACH | <= | M_TACH | ARE ALLOWED. In the Minkowski case only the static tachyon is allowed. The black hole is stable to the back reaction of these remaining tachyons, so they are good perturbations of the black hole, or ``hair''. However, this leaves only 3 tachyonic hairs in the black hole and 7 in the exact solution! Such sparse hair is clearly irrelevant to the maintenance of coherence during black hole evaporation. "
"The gravitational properties of the neutrino is studied in the weak field approximation. By imposing the hermiticity condition, CPT and CP invariance on the \em tensor matrix element, we shown that the allowed gravitational form factors for Dirac and Majorana neutrinos are very different. In a CPT and CP invariant theory, the \em tensor for a Dirac neutrino of the same specie is characterized by four gravitational form factors. As a result of CPT invariance, the \em tensor for a Majorana neutrino of the same specie has five form factors. In a CP invariant theory, if the initial and final Majorana neutrinos have the same (opposite) CP parity, then only tensor (pseudo-tensor) type transition are allowed. "
"We consider the predictions of chiral perturbation theory for $SU(3)$ breaking in the axial vector form factor $g_1$ measured in semileptonic hyperon decays. We confirm that if only octet baryon intermediate states are included, the non-analytic corrections are $\sim 100\%$. These corrections are dominated by an $SU(3)$-symmetric wavefunction renormalization, which explains the fact that the ``corrected'' predictions still fit the data well. We argue that the large corrections are nonetheless strong evidence that this chiral expansion is breaking down. Following a recent suggestion of Jenkins and Manohar, we then include contributions from decuplet baryon intermediate states. Unlike these authors, we do not neglect the octet--decuplet mass difference $\Delta$. We find that the effects of $\Delta \ne 0$ significantly change the pattern of corrections: we still find that the decuplet corrections can cancel the large octet contributions in a non-trivial way, but the corrections no longer favor the $SU(6)$ values of the axial couplings. We also argue that $D$ and $F$ axial couplings cannot be reliably extracted from calculations which keep only the non-analytic corrections. "
"We discuss the integrable hierarchies that appear in multi--matrix models. They can be envisaged as multi--field representations of the KP hierarchy. We then study the possible reductions of this systems via the Dirac reduction method by suppressing successively one by one part of the fields. We find in this way new integrable hierarchies, of which we are able to write the Lax pair representations by means of suitable Drinfeld--Sokolov linear systems. At the bottom of each reduction procedure we find an $N$--th KdV hierarchy. We discuss in detail the case which leads to the KdV hierarchy and to the Boussinesque hierarchy, as well as the general case in the dispersionless limit. "
"We discuss the relationship of the forward matrix element of the operator $\bar\psi\psi$, related to the so-called sigma term, to the quark number. We show that in the naive quark model in the canonical formalism these quantities coincide in the limit of small average quark momenta. In the QCD parton model defined through light-front quantization this result is preserved at leading perturbative order but it receives radiative corrections. We analyze the theoretical and phenomenological consequences of this result, which provides a bridge between a current algebra quantity, the sigma term, and a deep-inelastic quantity, the parton number. "
In this letter we study chaotic dynamical properties of an asymmetrically coupled one-dimensional chain of maps. We discuss the existence of coherent regions in terms of the presence of defects along the chain. We find out that temporal chaos is instantaneously localized around one single defect and that the tangent vector jumps from one defect to another in an apparently random way. We quantitatively measure the localization properties by defining an entropy-like function in the space of tangent vectors. 
"Recent results on the vacuum polarization induced by a thin string of magnetic flux lead us to suggest an analogue of the Copenhagen `flux spaghetti' QCD vacuum as a possible mechanism for avoiding the divergence of perturbative QED, thus permitting consistent completion of the full, nonperturbative theory. The mechanism appears to operate for spinor, but not scalar, QED. "
The Ashtekar-Renteln Ansatz gives the self-dual solutions to the Einstein equation. A direct generalization of the Ashtekar-Renteln An\-satz to N=1 supergravity is given both in the canonical and in the covariant formulation and a geometrical property of the solutions is pointed out. (Changes: the covariant formulation and some comments about a wave function has been added) 
"We consider the Earth effect in the MSW analysis of the Homestake, Kamiokande, GALLEX, and SAGE solar neutrino experiments. Using the time-averaged data and assuming two-flavor oscillations, the large-angle region of the combined fit extends to much smaller angles (to $\sin^22\theta \simeq 0.1$) than when the Earth effect is ignored. However, the additional constraint from the Kamiokande II day-night data excludes most of the parameter space sensitive to the Earth effect independent of astrophysical uncertainties, and leaves only a small large-angle region close to maximal mixing at 90\% C.L. The nonadiabatic solution remains unaffected by the Earth effect and is still preferred. Both theoretical and experimental uncertainties are included in the analysis. "
"The dominant production mechanism for ${\bar b} c$ bound states in high energy processes is the production of a high energy ${\bar b}$ or $c$ quark, followed by its fragmentation into the ${\bar b} c$ state. We calculate the fragmentation functions for the production of the S-wave states $B_c$ and $B_c^*$ to leading order in the QCD coupling constant. The fragmentation probabilities for ${\bar b} \rightarrow B_c$ and ${\bar b} \rightarrow B_c^*$ are approximately $2.2 \times 10^{-4}$ and $3.1 \times 10^{-4}$, while those for $c \rightarrow B_c$ and $c \rightarrow B_c^*$ are smaller by almost two orders of magnitude. "
A novel manifestation of nonlocality of quantum mechanics is presented. It is shown that it is possible to ascertain the existence of an object in a given region of space without interacting with it. The method might have practical applications for delicate quantum experiments. 
"A higher derivative term is introduced in the kinetic energy of the Higgs Lagrangian in the minimal Standard Model. A logically consistent and {\it finite} field theory is obtained when some excitations of the Higgs field are quantized with indefinite metric in the Hilbert space. The Landau ghost phenomenon of the conventional triviality problem is replaced by the state vectors of a complex ghost pair at a finite mass scale with observable physical consequences. It is shown that the ghost states exhibit unusual resonance properties and correspond to a complex conjugate pair of Pauli-Villars regulator masses in the euclidean path integral formulation of the theory. An argument is given that microscopic acausality effects associated with the ghost pair remain undetectable in scattering processes with realistic wave packects, and the S-matrix should exhibit unitarity in the observable sector of the Hilbert space.

"A 3d generally covariant field theory having some unusual properties is described. The theory has a degenerate 3-metric which effectively makes it a 2d field theory in disguise. For 2-manifolds without boundary, it has an infinite number of conserved charges that are associated with graphs in two dimensions and the Poisson algebra of the charges is closed. For 2-manifolds with boundary there are additional observables that have a Kac-Moody Poisson algebra. It is further shown that the theory is classically integrable and the general solution of the equations of motion is given. The quantum theory is described using Dirac quantization, and it is shown that there are quantum states associated with graphs in two dimensions. "
"The original \bnum -(or $\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$-) energy spectrum from the gravitational collapse of a star has a larger average energy than the spectrum for \bnue since the opacity of \bnue exeeds that of \bnum (or $\nu_{\tau}$). Flavor neutrino conversion, \bnue $\leftrightarrow$ \bnum, induced by lepton mixing results in partial permutation of the original \bnue and \bnum spectra. An upper bound on the permutation factor, $p \leq 0.35$ (99$\%$ CL) is derived using the data from SN1987A and the different models of the neutrino burst. The relation between the permutation factor and the vacuum mixing angle is established, which leads to the upper bound on this angle. The excluded region, $\sin^2 2\theta > 0.7 - 0.9$, covers the regions of large mixing angle solutions of the solar neutrino problem: ``just-so"" and, partly, MSW, as well as part of region of $\nu_{e} - \nu_{\mu}$ oscillation space which could be responsible for the atmospheric muon neutrino deficit. These limits are sensitive to the predicted neutrino spectrum and can be strengthened as supernova models improve. "
"In this paper we generalize the classical Noether-Lefschetz Theorem to arbitrary smooth projective threefolds. Let $X$ be a smooth projective threefold over complex numbers, $L$ a very ample line bundle on $X$. Then we prove that there is a positive integer $n_0(X,L)$ such that for $n \geq n_0(X,L)$, the Noether-Lefschetz locus of the linear system $H^0(X,L^n)$ is a countable union of proper closed subvarieties of $\P(H^0(X,L^n)^*)$ of codimension at least two. In particular, the {\em general singular member} of the linear system $H^0(X,L^n)$ is not contained in the Noether-Lefschetz locus. As an application of our main theorem we prove the following result: Let $X$ be a smooth projective threefold, $L$ a very ample line bundle. Assume that $n$ is very large. Let $S=\P(H^0(X,L^n)^*)$, let $K$ denote the function field of $S$. Let ${\cal Y}_K$ be the generic hypersurface corresponding to the sections of $H^0(X,L^n)$. Then we show that the natural map on codimension two cycles $$ CH^2(X_{\C}) \to CH^({\cal Y}_K) $$ is injective. This is a weaker version of a conjecture of M. V. Nori, which generalises the Noether-Lefschetz theorem on codimension one cycles on a smooth projective threefolds to arbitrary codimension "
"The QED effective action at finite temperature and density is calculated to all orders in an external homogeneous and time-independent magnetic field in the weak coupling limit. The free energy, obtained explicitly, exhibit the expected de\ Haas -- van\ Alphen oscillations. An effective coupling at finite temperature and density is derived in a closed form and is compared with renormalization group results. "
"High temperature series expansions of the spin-spin correlation function for the plane rotator (or XY) model on the sc lattice are extended by three terms through order $\beta^{17}$. Tables of the expansion coefficients are reported for the correlation function spherical moments of order $l=0,1,2$. Our analysis of the series leads to fairly accurate estimates of the critical parameters. "
"We consider isospin correlations of pions produced in a relativistic nuclear collision, using an effective theory of the chiral order parameter. Our theory has (1+1) Lorentz invariance as appropriate for the central rapidity region. We argue that in certain regions of space correlations of the chiral order parameter are described by the fixed point of the (1+1) WZNW model. The corresponding anomalous dimension determines scaling of the probability to observe a correlated cluster of pions with the size of this cluster in rapidity. Though the maximal size of clusters for which this scaling is applicable is cut off by pion mass, such clusters can still include sufficiently many particles to make the scaling observable. "
Newtonian dynamical systems which accept the normal shift on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold are considered. For them the determinating equations making the weak normality condition are derived. The expansion for the algebra of tensor fields is constructed. 
"The triviality Higgs mass bound is studied with a higher derivative regulator in the spontaneously broken phase of the four dimensional O(4) symmetric scalar field theory with quartic self-interaction. The phase diagram of the O(4) model is determined in a Monte Carlo simulation which interpolates between the hypercubic lattice regulator and the higher derivative regulator in continuum space-time. The same method can be used to calculate the Higgs mass bound in continuum space-time. In a large-N analysis, when compared with a hypercubic lattice, we find a relative increase in the triviality bound of the higher derivative regulator suggesting a strongly interacting Higgs sector in the TeV region with negligible dependence on regulator parameters. When the higher derivative regulator mass is brought close to the Higgs mass the model requires a more elaborate analysis of complex ghost states in scattering amplitudes.

A geometric global formulation of the higher-order Lagrangian formalism for systems with finite number of degrees of freedom is provided. The formalism is applied to the study of systems with groups of Noetherian symmetries. 
"Motivated by recent experimental studies of Bodenschatz et al. [E. Bodenschatz, J.R. de Bruyn, G. Ahlers and D.S. Cannell, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 67}, 3078 (1991) ], we present a numerical study of a generalized two dimensional Swift-Hohenberg equation to model pattern formation in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in a non-Boussinesq fluid. It is shown that many of the features observed in these experiments can be reproduced by this generalized model that explicitly includes non-Boussinesq and mean flow effects. The spontaneous formation of hexagons, rolls, and a rotating spiral pattern is studied, as well as the transitions and competition among them. Mean flow, non-Boussinesq effects, the geometric shape of the lateral wall, and sidewall forcing are all shown to be crucial in the formation of the rotating spirals. We also study nucleation and growth of hexagonal patterns and find that the front velocity in this two dimensional model is consistent with the prediction of marginal stability theory for one dimensional fronts.

"The renormalization group method is employed to study the effective potential in curved spacetime with torsion. The renormalization-group improved effective potential corresponding to a massless gauge theory in such a spacetime is found and in this way a generalization of Coleman-Weinberg's approach corresponding to flat space is obtained. A method which works with the renormalization group equation for two-loop effective potential calculations in torsionful spacetime is developed. The effective potential for the conformal factor in the conformal dynamics of quantum gravity with torsion is thereby calculated explicitly. Finally, torsion-induced phase transitions are discussed.

"A model consisting of oxygen-occupied and -vacant chains is considered, with repulsive first and second nearest-neighbor interactions V1 and V2, respectively. The statistical mechanics and the diffraction spectrum of the model is solved exactly and analytically with the only assumption V1 >> V2. At temperatures T ~ V1 only a broad maximum at (1/2,0,0) is present, while for ABS(delta - 1/2) > 1/14 at low enough T, the peak splits into two. The simple expression for the diffraction intensity obtained for T << V1 represents in a more compact form previous results of Khachaturyan and Morris[1],extends them to all delta and T/V2 and leads to a good agreement with experiment.

"{}From a finite-size scaling (FSS) theory of cumulants of the order parameter at phase coexistence points, we reconstruct the scaling of the moments. Assuming that the cumulants allow a reconstruction of the free energy density no better than as an asymptotic expansion, we find that FSS for moments of low order is still complete. We suggest ways of using this theory for the analysis of numerical simulations. We test these methods numerically through the scaling of cumulants and moments of the magnetization in the low-temperature phase of the two-dimensional Ising model.

"In a recent paper on SU(16) grand unification, because of the presence of intermediate-energy gauge groups containing products of U(1) factors which are not orthogonal among themselves, the renormalization-group treatment has a few small errors. I correct it. I emphasize that one should not switch gauge couplings at the various thresholds. It is easier, and it avoids errors, to use throughout the gauge couplings of the standard model, and compute at each threshold, in the usual way, the extra contributions to the beta functions from the extra non-decoupled fields. I also point out that the SU(16) grand unification theory, due to the large number of scalars present in it, is not asymptotically free. It becomes a strong-coupling theory at energies only slightly larger than the unification scale. "
"The effective potential for the local composite operator $\phi^{2}(x)$ in $\lambda \phi^{4}$-theory is investigated at finite temperature in an approach based on path-integral linearisation of the $\phi^4 $-interaction. At zero temperature, the perturbative vacuum is unstable, because a non-trivial phase with a scalar condensate $\langle \phi ^{2} \rangle _{0}$ has lower effective action. Due to field renormalisation, $\langle \lambda \phi ^{2} \rangle _{0}$ is renormalisation group invariant and leads to the correct scale anomaly. At a critical temperature $T_{c}$ the non-perturbative phase becomes meta-stable implying a first order phase-transition to the perturbative phase. The ratio $\langle\lambda \phi^{2} \rangle _{0} / T_{c}^{2} \approx 62$ turns out to be a universal constant. "
"Unitarily implementable Bogoliubov transformations for charged, relativistic bos\-ons and fermions are discussed, and explicit formulas for the 2-cocycles appearing in the group product of their implementers are derived. In the fermion case this provides a simple field theoretic derivation of the well-known cocycle of the group of unitary Hilbert space operators modeled on the Hilbert Schmidt class and closely related to the loop groups. In the boson case the cocycle is obtained for a similar group of pseudo-unitary (symplectic) operators. I also derive explcite formulas for the phases of one-parameter groups of implementers and, more generally, families of implementers which are unitary propagators with parameter dependent generators.

"We calculate perturbatively the pressure of a dilute gas of anyons through second order in the anyon coupling constant, as described by Chern-Simons field theory. Near Bose statistics , the divergences in the perturbative expansion are exactly cancelled by a two-body $\delta$-function potential which is not required near Fermi statistics. To the order considered, we find no need for a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. (This paper precedes the article ''Three loop calculation of the full anyonic partition function'', by R. Emparan and M. Valle Basagoiti, hep-th/9304103) "
"We give a derivation of the Verlinde formula for the $G_{k}$ WZW model from Chern-Simons theory, without taking recourse to CFT, by calculating explicitly the partition function $Z_{\Sigma\times S^{1}}$ of $\Sigma\times S^{1}$ with an arbitrary number of labelled punctures. By a suitable gauge choice, $Z_{\Sigma\times S^{1}}$ is reduced to the partition function of an Abelian topological field theory on $\Sigma$ (a deformation of non-Abelian BF and Yang-Mills theory) whose evaluation is straightforward. This relates the Verlinde formula to the Ray-Singer torsion of $\Sigma\times S^{1}$. We derive the $G_{k}/G_{k}$ model from Chern-Simons theory, proving their equivalence, and give an alternative derivation of the Verlinde formula by calculating the $G_{k}/G_{k}$ path integral via a functional version of the Weyl integral formula. From this point of view the Verlinde formula arises from the corresponding Jacobian, the Weyl determinant. Also, a novel derivation of the shift $k\ra k+h$ is given, based on the index of the twisted Dolbeault complex. "
"In this paper, we examine the analogy between topological string theory and equivariant cohomology. We also show that the equivariant cohomology of a topological conformal field theory carries a certain algebraic structure, which we call a gravity algebra.

"It is suggested that the axino mass in the 1 MeV region and gravitino mass in the eV region can provide an axino lifetime of order of the time of photon decoupling. In this case, some undecayed axinos act like cold dark matters and some axino decay products (gravitinos and hot axions) act like hot dark matters at the time of galaxy formation. "
"Although there is now a good measure of agreement between Monte Carlo and high-temperature series expansion estimates for Ising ($n=1$) models, published results for the critical temperature from series expansions up to 12{\em th} order for the three-dimensional classical Heisenberg ($n=3$) and XY ($n=2$) model do not agree very well with recent high-precision Monte Carlo estimates. In order to clarify this discrepancy we have analyzed extended high-temperature series expansions of the susceptibility, the second correlation moment, and the second field derivative of the susceptibility, which have been derived a few years ago by L\""uscher and Weisz for general $O(n)$ vector spin models on $D$-dimensional hypercubic lattices up to 14{\em th} order in $K \equiv J/k_B T$. By analyzing these series expansions in three dimensions with two different methods that allow for confluent correction terms, we obtain good agreement with the standard field theory exponent estimates and with the critical temperature estimates from the new high-precision MC simulations. Furthermore, for the Heisenberg model we reanalyze existing series for the susceptibility on the BCC lattice up to 11{\em th} order and on the FCC lattice up to 12{\em th} order. "
We write down the anomalous dimensions of the fields of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model or chiral Gross Neveu model with a continuous global chiral symmetry for the two cases $U(1)$ $\times$ $U(1)$ and $SU(M)$ $\times$ $SU(M)$ at $O(1/N^2)$ in a $1/N$ expansion. 
"We suggest that, similar to the many applications of chiral effective Lagrangian made recently to semileptonic decays of heavy hadrons involving Goldstone bosons, chiral symmetry can also be applied to many-body nonleptonic decays of heavy hadrons. As examples we establish the chiral effective Hamiltonian for some typical many-body nonleptonic decays of bottom hadrons. We discuss the lowest-order contributions coming from such a Hamiltonian. We emphasize that wide applications of this method are possible. "
"The static path approximation to the path integral representation of partition function provides a natural microscopic basis to deal with thermal fluctuations around mean field configurations. Using this approach for one-dimensional cranking Hamiltonian with quadrupole- quadrupole interaction term we have studied a few properties like energy, level density, level density parameter($a$) and moment of inertia as a function of temperature and spin for $^{64}Zn$ taking it as an illustrative example. We have also investigated the effects of variation in interaction strength on the level density and the parameter $a$ as a function of temperature. The moment of inertia, $\cal I$ versus rotational frequency, $\omega$ plot shows a sudden rise in the value of $\cal I$ due to rotation alignment of $0g_{9/2}$ orbitals at $\omega\approx 1.0$ MeV for a small temperature T $\sim 0.5$ MeV. At high T $\sim$ 2.0 MeV about 40-45$\%$ of each angular momentum is generated by alignment of $0g_{9/2}$ orbitals with an interesting result that at $\omega\sim 1.0$ MeV and spin J $\sim$ 16 the moment of inertia has almost a constant, temperature independent value.

"We calculate ground-state properties of a many-quark system in the string-flip model using variational Monte Carlo methods. The many-body potential energy of the system is determined by finding the optimal grouping of quarks into hadrons. This (optimal) assignment problem is solved by using the stochastic optimization technique of simulated annealing. Results are presented for the energy and length-scale for confinement as a function of density. These results show how quarks clustering decreases with density and characterize the nuclear- to quark-matter transition. We compare our results to a previously published work with a similar model which uses, instead, a pairing approach to the optimization problem. "
We introduce a ``pre-Bethe-Ansatz'' system of equations for three dimensional vertex models. We bring to the light various algebraic curves of high genus and discuss some situations where these curves simplify. As a result we describe remarkable subvarieties of the space of parameters. 
"Through numerical examples we show that the complex scaling method is suited to explore the pole structure in multichannel scattering problems. All poles lying on the multisheeted Riemann energy surface, including shadow poles, can be revealed and the Riemann sheets on which they reside can be identified. "
This work was initially motivated by Miranda's work on elliptic Weierstrass threefolds. Miranda [Mi] describes a smooth equidimensional (flat) model for any elliptic Weierstrass threefold; such models occur naturally in the study of moduli spaces. In this paper we use minimal model theory to link birational maps of log surfaces (log contractions) to equidimensional fibrations of elliptic threefolds. As a corollary we show that an elliptic fibration of positive Kodaira dimension has a minimal model with an equidimensional birationally equivalent elliptic fibration satisfying certain good properties that naturally generalize the case of elliptic fibrations of surfaces. We apply the results to the case of Weierstrass models and give a global explanation of Miranda's algorithm. 
"Riemannian geometry in four dimensions naturally leads to an SL(3) connection that annihilates a basis for self-dual two-forms. Einstein's equations may be written in terms of an SO(3) connection, with SO(3) chosen as an appropriate subgroup of SL(3). We show how a set of ""neighbours"" of Einstein's equations arises because the subgroup may be chosen in different ways. An explicit example of a non-Einstein metric obtained in this way is given. Some remarks on three dimensional space-times are made. "
We have implemented different algorithms for generating Poissonian and vectorizable random lattices. The random lattices fulfil the Voronoi/Delaunay construction. We measure the performance of our algorithms for the two types of random lattices and find that the average computation time is proportional to the number of points on the lattice. 
"We discuss the upper bound on the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass in the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model within the framework of a low energy renormalisation group analysis. We find $m_h$ < 146 GeV for $m_t$ = 90 GeV, decreasing to $m_h$ < 123 GeV for $m_t$ = 180 GeV. "
"A general formula for the entropy of stationary black holes in Lovelock gravity theories is obtained by integrating the first law of black hole mechanics, which is derived by Hamiltonian methods. The entropy is not simply one quarter of the surface area of the horizon, but also includes a sum of intrinsic curvature invariants integrated over a cross section of the horizon. "
We propose a way to reconcile the Standard Model of leptons with a purely vectorial theory. The observed neutrino is predicted to be massless. The unobservability of its partner and the $V-A$ structure of the weak currents are given the same origin. 
"Multiloop superstring amplitudes are calculated in the explicit form by the solution of Ward identities. A naive generalization of Belavin-Knizhnik theorem to the superstring is found to be incorrect since the period matrix turns out to be depended on the spinor structure over the terms proportional to odd moduli. These terms appear because fermions mix bosons under the two-dim. supersymmetry transformations. The closed, oriented superstring turns out to be finite, if it possesses the ten-dimensional supersymmetry, as well as the two-dimentional one. This problem needs a further study. "
"We have derived explicit expressions in the 1-d Ising model for multiplicity distributions $P_{\del\xi}(n)$ and factorial moments $F_q(\del\xi)$. We identify the salient features of $P_{\del\xi}(n)$ that lead to scaling, $F_q(\del\xi)=\F_q[F_2]$, and universality. These results compare well with the presently available high-energy data of $\bar{p}p$ and $e^+e^-$ reactions. We point out the important features that should be studied in future higher-energy experiments of multiparticle productions in $pp$, $\bar{p}p$, $ep$, $e^+e^-$, and $NN$. We also make comments on comparisons with KNO and negative-binomial distributions. "
"I discuss the properties of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model, in the case in which there is a dynamical breakdown of the electroweak symmetry induced by the formation of condensates of the third generation of quarks and their supersymmetric partners. The top quark and Higgs mass predictions derived within this scheme are essentially equivalent to those ones obtained from the requirement of bottom-tau Yukawa coupling unification in a supersymmetric grand unified scenario, if the compositeness scale is identified with the grand unification scale. I give an explanation of this interesting result, for which the relevance of the infrared quasi fixed point on the top quark Yukawa coupling is emphasized. "
"We explicitly show that the Landau gauge supersymmetry of Chern-Simons theory does not have any physical significance. In fact, the difference between an effective action both BRS invariant and Landau supersymmetric and an effective action only BRS invariant is a finite field redefinition. Having established this, we use a BRS invariant regulator that defines CS theory as the large mass limit of topologically massive Yang-Mills theory to discuss the shift $k \to k+\cv$ of the bare Chern-Simons parameter $k$ in conncection with the Landau supersymmetry. Finally, to convince ourselves that the shift above is not an accident of our regularization method, we comment on the fact that all BRS invariant regulators used as yet yield the same value for the shift. "
"I present an extension of the thin layer approximation to non-axisymmetric bow shocks. By choosing a suitable set of curvilinear coordinates that matches the geometry of a generally distorted bow shock surface, I derive the fluid equations for the flow. Analytical expansions are given for the matter flow near the bow shock stagnation point. Numerical solutions are also obtained, by using a revised Runge-Kutta method. This numerical method results to be computationally stable and fast. When two winds interact, axisymmetric bow shocks are expected to form only if both winds are spherically symmetric. But stellar winds often present strong anisotropies: for all these cases a non-axisymmetric model of bow shock is required. "
"We review recent progress in our understanding of the physics of energetic particles in our Galaxy, in active galaxies such as starburst galaxies, in active galactic nuclei and in the jets and radio hot spots of powerful radio galaxies and radioloud quasars. We propose that cosmic rays originate mainly in three sites, a) normal supernova explosions into the approximately homogeneous interstellar medium, b) supernova explosions into stellar winds, and c) hot spots of powerful radio galaxies. The predictions based on this proposition have been tested successfully against airshower data over the particle energy range from 10 TeV to 100 EeV. The low energy cosmic ray particles carried out by galactic winds to the intergalactic medium may ionize and heat this medium consistent with all known constraints. Furthermore we propose that radioloud quasars accelerate nuclei to high energies in shocks in the inner sections of their jets, and thus initiate hadronic cascades which produce the $\gamma$-ray emission observed with GRO. Radio observations of the Galactic center compact source suggest that there is a jet similar to that in quasars, but very much weaker in its emission; simple modelling suggests that the power carried by this jet is of order similar to the accretion disk luminosity. By analogy we speculate that also radioweak quasars have jets which carry a large proportion of the accretion power, and which accelerate particles to high energy. "
"The finite temperature effective potential of the Abelian Higgs Model is studied using the self-consistent composite operator method, which sums up the contributions of daisy and superdaisy diagrams. The effect of the momentum dependence of the effective masses is estimated by using a Rayleigh-Ritz variational approximation. "
"We study the production of single isolated leptons at large transverse momentum, $p_T^\ell > M_W/2$. The dominant source of such leptons is production of an on-shell $W$ boson recoiling against a hard jet. Vetoing this jet forces the $W$ boson to be produced off resonance and significantly reduces the standard model cross section, thereby enhancing the discovery prospects for non standard model physics. A significant number of events have the topologically interesting signature of a large $p_T$ lepton balancing a jet with little measured missing transverse energy. "
"Ge, Rusjan, and Zweifel (J. Stat. Phys. 59, 1265 (1990)) introduced a binary tree which represents all the periodic windows in the chaotic regime of iterated one-dimensional unimodal maps. We consider the scaling behavior in a modified tree which takes into account the self-similarity of the window structure. A non-universal geometric convergence of the associated superstable parameter values towards a Misiurewicz point is observed for almost all binary sequences with periodic tails. There are an infinite number of exceptional sequences, however, which lead to superexponential scaling. The origin of such sequences is explained. "
"In this paper we show that a relativistic membrane admits an equivalent representation in terms of the Kalb-Ramond gauge field $F_{\mu\nu\rho}=\partial_{\,[\,\mu}B_{\nu\rho]}$ encountered in string theory. By `` equivalence '' we mean the following: if $x=X(\xi)$ is a solution of the classical equations of motion derived from the Dirac-Nambu-Goto action, then it is always possible to find a differential form of {\it rank three}, satisfying Maxwell-type equations. The converse proposition is also true. In the first part of the paper, we show that a relativistic membrane, regarded as a mechanical system, admits a Hamilton-Jacobi formulation in which the H-J function describing a family of classical membrane histories is given by $\displaystyle{F=dB=dS^1\wedge dS^2\wedge dS^3}$. In the second part of the paper, we introduce a {\it new} lagrangian of the Kalb-Ramond type which provides a {\it first order} formulation for both open and closed membranes. Finally, for completeness, we show that such a correspondence can be established in the very general case of a p-brane coupled to gravity in a spacetime of arbitrary dimensionality. "
"Based on 1) a conjecture about the mean free path for particle scattering in perpendicular shock geometries, and 2) a model for Wolf Rayet star winds, we argue that explosions of Wolf Rayet stars can lead through diffusive particle acceleration to particle energies up to 3 10^9 GeV. As a test we first demonstrate that the magnetic fields implied by this argument are compatible with the dynamo limit applied to the convective interior of the main sequence stars which are predecessors of Wolf Rayet stars; second we show that this implies the same strength of the magnetic fields as is suggested by the magnetically driven wind theory. Third, we use data from radio supernovae to check the spectrum, luminosity and time dependence which suggest that the magnetic fields again have to be as high as suggested by the magnetically driven wind theory. This constitutes evidence for the magnetic field strengths required to accelerate particles to 3 10^9 GeV. Fourth, we demonstrate that within our picture the nonthermal radio emission from OB and Wolf Rayet stars can reproduce the proper radio spectra, time variability and radio luminosities. Fifth, the comparison of Wolf Rayet stars and radio supernovae suggests that electron injection into the acceleration process is a step function of efficiency with the shock speed as the independent parameter. "
"Electromagnetic properties of diquarks are investigated in the framework of a color-octet Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, which describes baryons as bound states of diquarks and quarks. We calculate the electromagnetic form factors of scalar and axial vector diquark bound states using the gauge--invariant proper--time regularization. The nucleon charge radii and magnetic moments are estimated in a simple additive diquark--quark model. This picture reproduces the qualitative features such as the negative charge radius of the neutron. Within this model axial vector diquarks are seen to be important. "

"The amplitude of production of $n$ on-mass-shell scalar bosons by a highly virtual field $\phi$ is considered in a $\lambda \phi^4$ theory with weak coupling $\lambda$ and spontaneously broken symmetry. The amplitude of this process is known to have an $n!$ growth when the produced bosons are exactly at rest. Here it is shown that for $n \gg 1/\lambda$ the process goes through `quantum bubbles', i.e. quantized droplets of a different vacuum phase, which are non-perturbative resonant states of the field $\phi$. The bubbles provide a form factor for the production amplitude, which rapidly decreases above the threshold. As a result the probability of the process may be heavily suppressed and may decrease with energy $E$ as $\exp (-const \cdot E^a)$, where the power $a$ depends on the number of space dimensions. Also discussed are the quantized states of bubbles and the amplitudes of their formation and decay. "
"A new approach is provided to determine the dilaton--antisymmetric tensor coupling in a supergravity theory by considering the static supersymmetric field configuration around a super extended object, which is consistently formulated in a curved superspace. By this, the corresponding SUSY transformation rules can also be determined for vanishing fermionic fields as well as bosonic fields other than those in the determined coupling. Therefore, we can, in turn, use this determined part of the supergravity theory to study all the related vacuum-like solutions. We have determined the dilaton--antisymmetric tensor couplings, in which each of the antisymmetric tensors is a singlet of the automorphism group of the corresponding superalgebra, for every supergravity multiplet. This actually happens only for $N \leq 2$ supergravity theories, which agrees completely with the spin-content analysis and the classified $N \leq 2$ super $p$-branes, therefore giving more support to the existence of the fundamental Type II $p$-branes. A prediction is made of the $D = 9, N = 2$ supergravity which has not yet been written down so far. "
"We present the results of our recent calculation of $\epsilon^{\prime}/ \epsilon$ at the Next-to-Leading (NLO) order in QCD and QED, in the framework of $\DSone$ Effective Hamiltonians. The operator matrix elements are taken from lattice QCD, at a scale $\mu=2\,\,\mbox{GeV}$. NLO corrections seem to lower the value of $\epsilon^{\prime}/\epsilon$, favouring the experimental result of E731. Contributions from different operators are analyzed and dependence on $\mt$, $\mu$ and $\Lambda_{\sss QCD}$ discussed.

"Recent observations suggest appreciable star formation activity in early-type galaxies down to redshift $z\sim 0.5$. If so, there is likely to be dust in these galaxies. We consider the possibility that obscuration by dust can reconcile the observed frequency of gravitational lensing of quasar images with the considerably larger rate predicted in a low density cosmologically flat universe dominated by a cosmological constant.

"We discuss the large radiative corrections to the masses of supersymmetric Higgs bosons in the MSSM and in its simplest extension, the NMSSM, with particular attention paid to the bounds on the lightest CP-even Higgs mass found in both models. In the case of the MSSM, these corrections are found to be primarily associated with the effects top quark and stop squark loops, while for extended models they also include significant contributions from Higgs and Higgsino loops. (Talk presented at SUSY-93, Boston, March 1993) "
Within the framework of the minimum quadratic Poincare gauge theory of gravity in the Riemann-Cartan spacetime we study the influence of gravitational vacuum energy density (a cosmological constant) on the dynamics of various gravitating systems. It is shown that the inclusion of the cosmological term can lead to gravitational repulsion. For some simple cases of spatially homogeneous cosmological models with radiation we obtain non-singular solutions in form of elementary functions and elliptic integrals. 
"A democratic form version of the Rosner-Worah quark mass matrix is discussed from a phenomenological point of view. It is pointed out that an ansatz of ""maximal CP violation"" can provide reasonable values of the Kobayashi-Maskawa mixings. "
"Possible anomalous couplings of the top-quark to on-shell photons and gluons are constrained by the recent results of the CLEO Collaboration on both inclusive and exclusive radiative $B$ decays. We find that the process \bsg\ can lead to reasonable bounds on both the anomalous electric and magnetic dipole moments of the top-quark, while essentially no limits are obtained on the corresponding chromoelectric and chromomagnetic moments, which enter the expression for the decay rate only through operator mixing.

"A general two-dimensional spin model with U$(N)$ invariance, interpolating between $\CPN$ and ${\rm O}(2N)$ models, is studied in detail in order to illustrate both the general features of the $1/N$ expansion on the lattice and the specific techniques devised to extract scaling (field-theoretical) behavior. The continuum version of the model is carefully analyzed deriving quantitative $O(1/N)$ physical predictions in order to establish a benchmark for lattice computations. The $1/N$ expansion on the lattice, including second-nearest-neighbor interactions, is set up by constructing explicitly effective propagators and vertices. The technique of asymptotic expansion of the lattice propagators, basic to the derivation of analytical results in the scaling domain, is presented in full detail and applied to the model. Physical quantities, like the free energy and different definitions of correlation length, are evaluated. The lattice renormalization-group trajectories are identified and universality among different lattice (and continuum) schemes in the scaling region is explicitly proven. A review of other developments based on the lattice $1/N$ expansion is presented. "
A representation of the quantum affine algebra $U_{q}(\widehat{sl}_3)$ of an arbitrary level $k$ is constructed in the Fock module of eight boson fields. This realization reduces the Wakimoto representation in the $q \rightarrow 1$ limit. The analogues of the screening currents are also obtained. They commute with the action of $U_{q}(\widehat{sl}_3)$ modulo total differences of some fields. 
"We give the description of discretized moduli spaces (d.m.s.) $\Mcdisc$ introduced in \cite{Ch1} in terms of a discrete de Rham cohomologies for each moduli space $\Mgn$ of a genus $g$, $n$ being the number of punctures. We demonstrate that intersection indices (cohomological classes) calculated for d.m.s. coincide with the ones for the continuum moduli space $\Mc$ compactified by Deligne and Mumford procedure. To show it we use a matrix model technique. The Kontsevich matrix model is a generating function for these indices in the continuum case, and the matrix model with the potential $N\alpha \tr {\bigl(- \fr 12 \L X\L X +\log (1-X)+X\bigr)}$ is the one for d.m.s. In the last case the effects of reductions become relevant, but we use the stratification procedure in order to express integrals over open spaces $\Mdisc$ in terms of intersection indices which are to be calculated on compactified spaces. The coincidence of the cohomological classes for both continuum and d.m.s. models enables us to propose the existence of a quantum group structure on d.m.s. Then d.m.s. are nothing but cyclic (exceptional) representations of a quantum group related to a moduli space $\Mc$. Considering the explicit expressions for integrals of Chern classes over $\Mc$ and $\Mcdisc$ we conjecture that each moduli space $\Mc$ in the Kontsevich parametrization can be presented as a coset $\Mc ={\bf T}^d/G$, $d=3g-3+n$, where ${\bf T}^d$ is some $d$--dimensional complex torus and $G$ is a finite order symmetry group of ${\bf T}^d$. "
"We demonstrate how the virtual photoproduction of vector mesons on nuclei scans the wave function of vector mesons from the large non-perturbative transverse size $\rho \sim R_{V}$ down to the small perturbative size $\rho \sim 1/\sqrt{Q^{2}}$. Thee mechanism of scanning is based on color transparency and QCD predicted spatial wave function of quark-antiquark fluctuations of virtual photons. A rich, energy- and $Q^{2}$-dependent, pattern of the nuclear shadowing and antishadowing is predicted, which can be tested at the European Electron Facility and SLAC. "
The general theory of the branching processes is used for establishing the relation between the parameters $k$ and $\bar n$ of the negative binomial distribution. This relation gives the possibility to describe the overall data on multiplicity distributions in $pp (p\bar p)$-collisions for energies up to 900 GeV and to make several interesting predictions for higher energies. This general approach is free from ambiguities associated with the extrapolation of the parameter $k$ to unity. 
"The burning of a neutron star by strange matter is analyzed using relativistic combustion theory with a planar geometry. It is shown that such burning is probably neither slow combustion nor simple detonation. Fast combustion without detonation is possible under certain circumstances, but would involve very efficient heat transfer mechanisms. It is found, however, that the burning is most likely absolutely unstable with no well defined burn front. "
"Four-dimensional heavy-fermion QED is studied in light-cone coordinates with (anti-)periodic field boundary conditions. We carry out a consistent light-cone canonical quantization of this model using the Dirac algorithm for a system with first- and second-class constraints. To examine the role of the zero modes, we consider the quantization procedure in {the }zero-mode {and the non-zero-mode} sectors separately. In both sectors we obtain the physical variables and their canonical commutation relations. The physical Hamiltonian is constructed via a step-by-step exclusion of the unphysical degrees of freedom. An example using this Hamiltonian in which the zero modes play a role is the verification of the correct Coulomb potential between two heavy fermions. "
"We give a definition for the notion of statistics in the lattice-theoretical (or propositional) formulation of quantum mechanics of Birchoff, von Neumann and Piron. We show that this formalism is compatible only with two types of statistics: Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac. Some comments are made about the connection between this result and the existence of exotic statistics (para-statistics, infinite statistics, braid statistics). "
The cross section for coherent nuclear processes in which an incident meson or photon dissociates diffractively into two jets of high relative transverse momentum (between about 1 and 3 GeV/c) is found to be proportional in QCD to $A^2$ in a wide kinematical region. The leading correction to this is a significant positive term $\propto A^{7/3}$ caused by nuclear multiple-scattering. We find also that shadowing of hard diffractive processes reappears as a leading twist effect in the TeV energy range. 
A gravitational instanton is found that can tunnel into a new more stable vacuum phase where diffeomorphism invariance is broken and pitchfork bifurcations develop. This tunnelling process involves a double sphaleron-like transition which is associated with an extra level of quantization which is above that is contained in quantum field theory. 
"Bogomolny's formula for energy-smoothed scars is applied for the first time to a non-specific, non-scalable Hamiltonian, a 2-D anharmonic oscillator. The semiclassical theory reproduces well the exact quantal results over a large spatial and energy range. "
"In these introductory notes I explain some basic ideas in string field theory. These include: the concept of a string field, the issue of background independence, the reason why minimal area metrics solve the problem of generating all Riemann surfaces with vertices and propagators, and how Batalin-Vilkovisky structures arise from the state spaces of conformal field theories including ghosts. More advanced topics and recent developments are summarized. (To appear in the proceedings of the 1992 Summer School at Les Houches.)} "
"Static black holes in two-dimensional string theory can carry tachyon hair. Configurations which are non-singular at the event horizon have non-vanishing asymptotic energy density. Such solutions can be smoothly extended through the event horizon and have non-vanishing energy flux emerging from the past singularity. Dynamical processes will not change the amount of tachyon hair on a black hole. In particular, there will be no tachyon hair on a black hole formed in gravitational collapse if the initial geometry is the linear dilaton vacuum. There also exist static solutions with finite total energy, which have singular event horizons. Simple dynamical arguments suggest that black holes formed in gravitational collapse will not have tachyon hair of this type. "
"Using finite size scaling and histogram methods we obtain numerical results from lattice simulations indicating the logarithmic triviality of scalar quantum electrodynamics, even when the bare gauge coupling is chosen large. Simulations of the non-compact formulation of the lattice abelian Higgs model with fixed length scalar fields on $L^{4}$ lattices with $L$ ranging from $6$ through $20$ indicate a line of second order critical points. Fluctuation-induced first order transitions are ruled out. Runs of over ten million sweeps for each $L$ produce specific heat peaks which grow logarithmically with $L$ and whose critical couplings shift with $L$ picking out a correlation length exponent of $0.50(5)$ consistent with mean field theory. This behavior is qualitatively similar to that found in pure $\lambda\phi^{4}$. "
"We calculate production rates for massless $(u,d)$ and massive $(s,c,b)$ quarks in pure glue and quark gluon plasmas to leading order in the strong coupling constant $g$. The leading contribution comes from gluon decay into $q\bar q$ pairs, using a thermal gluon propagator with finite thermal mass and damping rate. The rate behaves as $\alpha_S^2(\ln 1/\alpha_S)^2 T^4$ when $m, \alpha_S \rightarrow 0$ and depends linearly on the transverse gluon damping rate for all values of the quark mass $m$. The light quark ($u$, $d$, $s$) chemical equilibration time is approximately 10-100 $T^{-1}$ for $g=$2-3, so that quarks are likely to remain far from chemical equilibrium in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions. "
"We study the cosmological solutions of the one loop corrected superstring effective action, in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background, and in the presence of the dilaton and modulus fields. A particularly interesting class of solutions is found which avoid the initial singularity and are consistent with the perturbative treatment of the effective action. "
"Let L be an ample line bundle on a log variety (V, D) having only log terminal singularities.The Kodaira energy of such a triple (V, D, L) is defined as follows: \kappa\epsilon=-Inf{t\in Q | K(V,D)+tL is big}. Here K(V,D)=K_V+D is the log canonical bundle of (V,D) and ""big"" means \kappa=dim V. We first show that the rationality of \kappa\epsilon, when it is negative, follows from log Flip theorems (thus it is proved for dim V\le 3 at present). Second we consider the case in which D=0, dim V=3 and V has only terminal singularities. Let S be the set of all the possible values of Kodaira energies of such polarized log threefolds. We prove that S has no negative limit point. This result is closely related to the boundedness of Fano 3-folds. "
The isomonodromic deformations underlying the Painlev\'e transcendants are interpreted as nonautonomous Hamiltonian systems in the dual $\gR^*$ of a loop algebra $\tilde\grg$ in the classical $R$-matrix framework. It is shown how canonical coordinates on symplectic vector spaces of dimensions four or six parametrize certain rational coadjoint orbits in $\gR^*$ via a moment map embedding. The Hamiltonians underlying the Painlev\'e transcendants are obtained by pulling back elements of the ring of spectral invariants. These are shown to determine simple Hamiltonian systems within the underlying symplectic vector space. 
"Heavy quark symmetry relations for $B\rightarrow De\bar \nu_e$ and $B\rightarrow D^*e \bar \nu_e$ form factors receive corrections suppressed by powers of the charm quark mass. For small up and down quark massed the leading corrections of order $(1/m_c)^{n+2}~n = 0,1,2,...$ have a nonanalytic dependence on the light quark masses of the form $\ell n m_\pi^2$ for $n = 0$ and $(1/m_\pi)^n$ for $n = 1,2, ...$~. These corrections arise from very low momentum physics (i.e., well below the chiral symmetry breaking scale) and are computed using chiral perturbation theory. They are typically of order a few percent. "
We present an algorithm for the construction of the branching functions in the vacuum sector for affine Lie algebras based on the string hypothesis solution to a system of Bethe equations for generalized RSOS models. We also mention how the ground state structure and features of the excitation spectra like the Brillouin zone schemes of these models (and those in the same universality classes) can be extracted from combinatoric arguments and encoded in Lie algebraic terms. 
"If a quantum system of Hilbert space dimension $mn$ is in a random pure state, the average entropy of a subsystem of dimension $m\leq n$ is conjectured to be $S_{m,n}=\sum_{k=n+1}^{mn}\frac{1}{k}-\frac{m-1}{2n}$ and is shown to be $\simeq \ln m - \frac{m}{2n}$ for $1\ll m\leq n$. Thus there is less than one-half unit of information, on average, in the smaller subsystem of a total system in a random pure state. "
"A detailed reexamination is made of the exact operator formalism of two-dimensional Liouville quantum gravity in Minkowski spacetime with the cosmological term fully taken into account. Making use of the canonical mapping from the interacting Liouville field into a free field, we focus on the problem of how the Liouville exponential operator should be properly defined. In particular, the condition of mutual locality among the exponential operators is carefully analyzed, and a new solution, which is neither smoothly connected nor relatively local to the existing solution, is found. Our analysis indicates that, in Minkowski spacetime, coupling gravity to matter with central charge $d<1$ is problematical. For $d=1$, our new solution appears to be the appropriate one; for this value of $d$, we demonstrate that the operator equation of motion is satisfied to all orders in the cosmological constant with a certain regularization. As an application of the formalism, an attempt is made to study how the basic generators of the ground ring get modified due to the inclusion of the cosmological term. Our investigation, although incomplete, suggests that in terms of the canonically mapped free field the ground ring is not modified. "
"We study the dynamical evolution of idealised stellar systems by averaging results from many $N$-body simulations, each having modest numbers of stars. For isolated systems with stars of uniform mass, we discuss aspects of evolution up to the point of core collapse: relaxation and its $N$-dependence, the evolution of the density profile, the development of the velocity dispersion and anisotropy, and the rate of stellar escape. "
"We analyze the statistical properties of bubble models for the large-scale distribution of galaxies. To this aim, we realize static simulations, in which galaxies are mostly randomly arranged in the regions surrounding bubbles. As a first test, we realize simulations of the Lick map, by suitably projecting the three-dimensional simulations. In this way, we are able to safely compare the angular correlation function implied by a bubbly geometry to that of the APM sample. We find that several bubble models provide an adequate amount of large-scale correlation, which nicely fits that of APM galaxies. Further, we apply the statistics of the count-in-cell moments to the three-dimensional distribution and compare them with available observational data on variance, skewness and kurtosis. Based on our purely geometrical constructions, we find that a well defined hierarchical scaling of higher order moments up to scales $\sim 70\hm$. The overall emerging picture is that the bubbly geometry is well suited to reproduce several aspects of large-scale clustering. "
"If the standard electroweak gauge model is embedded in a larger theory which is supersymmetric and the latter breaks down to the former at some mass scale, then the reduced Higgs potential at the electroweak mass scale may differ from that of the well-known minimal supersymmetric extension. Specifically, if the larger theory is based on $\rm {SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)}$, an interesting alternative exists for two Higgs doublets. "
"Previous theories of dilute polymer solutions have failed to distinguish clearly between two very different ways of taking the long-chain limit: (I) $N \to\infty$ at fixed temperature $T$, and (II) $N \to\infty$, $T \to T_\theta$ with $x \equiv N^\phi (T-T_\theta)$ fixed. I argue that the modern two-parameter theory (continuum Edwards model) applies to case II --- not case I --- and in fact gives exactly the crossover scaling functions for $x \ge 0$ modulo two nonuniversal scale factors. A Wilson-type renormalization group clarifies the connection between crossover scaling functions and continuum field theories. [Also contains a general discussion of the connection between the Wilson and field-theoretic renormalization groups. Comments solicited.] "
(Revised LaTex version).The structure of free field representation and some correlation functions of the SU(3) CFT are considered. 
"We study by non perturbative techniques a vector, axial--vector theory characterized by a parameter which interpolates between pure vector and chiral Schwinger models. Main results are two windows in the space of parameters which exhibit acceptable solutions. In the first window we find a free massive and a free massless bosonic excitations and interacting left--right fermions endowed with asymptotic \hbox{states}, which feel however a long range interaction. In the second window the massless bosonic excitation is a negative norm state which can be consistently expunged from the ``physical"" Hilbert space; fermions are confined. An intriguing feature of our model occurs in the first window where we find that fermionic correlators scale at both short and long distances, but with different critical exponents. The infrared limit in the fermionic sector is nothing but a dynamically generated massless Thirring model. "
A method to obtain explicit and complete topological solution of SU(2) Chern-Simons theory on $S^3$ is developed. To this effect the necessary aspects of the theory of coloured-oriented braids and duality properties of conformal blocks for the correlators of $SU(2)_k$ Wess-Zumino conformal field theory are presented. A large class of representations of the generators of the groupoid of coloured-oriented braids are obtained. These provide a whole lot of new link invariants of which Jones polynomials are the simplest examples. These new invariants are explicitly calculated as illustrations for knots upto eight crossings and two-component multicoloured links upto seven crossings. 
"One of the crucial aspects of density perturbations that are produced by the standard inflation scenario is that they are Gaussian where seeds produced by topological defects tend to be non-Gaussian. The three point correlation function of the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CBR) provides a sensitive test of this aspect of the primordial density field. In this paper, this function is calculated in the general context of various allowed non-Gaussian models. It is shown that by COBE and the forthcoming South Pole and Balloon CBR anisotropy data may be able to test provide a crucial test of Gaussianity. "
"The three-state Potts model is numerically investigated on three-dimensional simple cubic lattices of up to \(128^3\) volume, concentrating on the neighborhood of the first-order phase transition separating the ordered and disordered phases. In both phases clusters of like spins are observed with irregular boundaries. In the ordered phase the two different non-favored spins are found to attract each other with a long but finite range. As a result, the neighborhoods of the non-favored spins are interpreted as domains of the disordered phase. This explains why the first-order phase transitions associated with the global \(Z_3\) symmetry, including the SU(3) pure-gauge one, are so weak. "
"We study the efficiency of a neural-net filter and deconvolution method for estimating jet energies and spectra in high-background reactions such as nuclear collisions at the relativistic heavy-ion collider and the large hadron collider. The optimal network is shown to be surprisingly close but not identical to a linear high-pass filter. A suitably constrained deconvolution method is shown to uncover accurately the underlying jet distribution in spite of the broad network response. Finally, we show that possible changes of the jet spectrum in nuclear collisions can be analyzed quantitatively, in terms of an effective energy loss with the proposed method. {} {Dong D W and Gyulassy M 1993}{Neural filters for jet analysis} {(LBL-31560) Physical Review E Vol~47(4) pp~2913-2922} "
"The coupling of topological matter to topological Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions is considered and a model is presented. It is shown that, contrary to the two-dimensional case, this coupling leads to a breaking of the topological symmetry. This means that the vacuum expectation values of the observables of the theory loose their invariance under small deformations of the metric while the action of the model possesses all the symmetries corresponding to the case with no coupling. "
Hadronic production of nonrelativistic boundstates of $b^{\prime}$ or isosinglet quarks D with suppressed weak decays is investigated for LHC and SSC energies. QCD corrections to production and decay rates are incorporated. Large rates for final states from $\eta_{b^{\prime}}\rightarrow HZ$ are predicted. 
"Hawking's 1974 calculation of thermal emission from a classical black hole led to his 1976 proposal that information may be lost from our universe as a pure quantum state collapses gravitationally into a black hole, which then evaporates completely into a mixed state of thermal radiation. Another possibility is that the information is not lost, but is stored in a remnant of the evaporating black hole. A third idea is that the information comes out in nonthermal correlations within the Hawking radiation, which would be expected to occur at too slow a rate, or be too spread out, to be revealed by any nonperturbative calculation. "
"For a class of first order gauge theories it was shown that the proper solution of the BV-master equation can be obtained straightforwardly. Here we present the general condition which the gauge generators should satisfy to conclude that this construction is relevant. The general procedure is illustrated by its application to the Chern-Simons theory in any odd-dimension. Moreover, it is shown that this formalism is also applicable to BRST field theories, when one replaces the role of the exterior derivative with the BRST charge of first quantization. "
"Carrying out perturbations around a lattice topological field theory in two dimensions, we show that it is on a first order phase transition fixed point with multiplicity ${n(n-1)/2}$, where $n$ is the number of its independent physical observables. We discuss about the order parameters and the finite size effect for the free energy. The finite size effect is described by the topological field theory. We investigate also the renormalization group flow near the fixed point, and show that the flow agrees with that of the Nienhuis-Nauenberg criterion. "
"We study the electromagnetic vertex of a nucleon in next-to-leading order chiral perturbation theory (CPT). We consider the case where one of the nucleons at the $\gamma$NN vertex is off its mass shell. We define relevant measures for the off-shell dependence in the limited kinematical range allowed, and analyze their expansion in the pion mass. The leading nonanalytic contributions are calculated to estimate their size. "
"We study a model based on $N$ scalar complex fields coupled to a scalar real field, where all fields are treated classically as c-numbers. The model describes a composite particle made up of $N$ constituents with bare mass $m_0$ interacting both with each other and with themselves via the exchange of a particle of mass $\mu_0$. The stationary states of the composite particle are described by relativistic Hartree's equations. Since the self-interaction is included, the case of an elementary particle is a nontrivial special case of this model. Using an integral transform method we derive the exact ground state solution and prove its local stability. The mass of the composite particle is calculated as the total energy in the rest frame. For the case of a massless exchange particle the mass formula is given in closed form. The mass, as a function of the coupling constant, possesses a well pronounced minimum for each value of $\mu_0/m_0$, while the absolute minimum occurs at $\mu_0=0$. "
We investigate a dynamically triangulated random surface action that consists of a gaussian term plus the modulus of the intrinsic scalar curvature. We find that the flips are frozen out and the internal geometry is regularized as the coefficient of the latter term is increased. Such a term thus provides a way of interpolating between dynamically triangulated (ie fluid) and crystalline random surfaces. 
"The Coulomb-Higgs phase transition of the four dimensional Z$_8$ gauge model is studied. We find clear first order properties in contradiction with the previously stressed second order behavior. That transition point may be regarded as the end of a transition line of the U(1)-Higgs model with charge $q=8$, that has been also assumed of second order. We show that this line is first order in a wide region, with a decreasing latent heat that goes to zero when closing to the 4--$d$ XY model limit. "
"Chiral symmetry and heavy quark symmetry constrain the interactions of mesons containing a single heavy quark with low-momentum pions. Chiral corrections to the Isgur-Wise function for $\bar B_s \rightarrow D_s^{(*)}$ versus $\bar B \rightarrow D^{(*)}$ semileptonic decay, the ratio of heavy meson decay constants $f_{D_s}/ f_D$ or $f_{B_s}/ f_B$, the amplitudes for $B_s - \bar B_s$ versus $B^0 - \bar B{\,}^0$ mixing, and the heavy meson mass splittings are calculated in chiral perturbation theory.

The influence of dilution with non--magnetic impurities on the order in the ground state of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet is investigated by Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Data of the spin correlation functions and thermodynamic properties for system sizes up to $L\times L=16\times16$ and for impurity concentrations up to $\delta=37.5\%$ are presented. In the low doping regime the correlation length shows similiar dependence on temperature as in the pure case. The staggered magnetization $\langle N_z^2(\delta)\rangle$ in the ground state which is the order parameter of the present model is estimated by extrapolating data at low temperatures. Impurity concentration dependence of $\langle N_z^2(\delta)\rangle$ is presented. $\langle N_z^2(\delta)\rangle$ decreases monotonically with impurity concentration and becomes very small around $\delta_c \sim 0.35$ which is much smaller than the classical percolation threshold. 
Using distributional techniques we calculate the energy--momentum tensor of the Schwarzschild geometry. It turns out to be a well--defined tensor--distribution concentrated on the $r=0$ region which is usually excluded from space--time. This provides a physical interpretation for the curvature of this geometry. 
"We give a direct proof of the new ""product"" expression for the Ramond sector characters of N=2 minimal models recently suggested by E. Witten. Our construction allows us to generalize these expressions to the D and E series of N=2 minimal models, as well as to other N=2 Kazama--Suzuki coset models such as $SU(N)\times SO(2(N-1))/SU(N-1)\times U(1)$. We verify that these expressions indeed coincide with the corresponding Landau--Ginzburg ""elliptic genus"", a certain topologically invariant twisted path integral with the effective Landau--Ginzburg action, which we obtain by using Witten's method. We indicate how our approach may be used to construct (or rule out) possible Landau--Ginzburg potentials for describing other N=2 superconformal theories. "
"It is shown that the two dimensional gravity, described either in the conformal gauge (the Liouville theory) or in the light cone gauge, when coupled to matter possesses an infinite number of twisted $N=2$ superconformal symmetries. The central charges of the $N=2$ algebra for the two gauge choices are in general different. Further, it is argued that the physical states in the light cone gauge theory can be obtained from the Liouville theory by a field redefinition. "
"General issues in the renormalization group evolution of fermion masses and mixings is discussed. An effective fixed point in the top quark Yukawa coupling can strongly constrain its value at the electroweak scale. Predictions following from Yukawa coupling unification are affected by threshold corrections at the grand unified scale. The Landau pole translates into an upper limit on the strong gauge coupling $\alpha _3(M_Z)$. Given the hierarchy in the fermion sector, the evolution of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix can be expressed in terms of a single scaling parameter $S$. Using this scaling factor and analogous scaling factors for the quark and lepton masses, we outline a systematic strategy that readily yields electroweak predictions for any GUT scale texture.} "
A formalism previously introduced by the author using tesselated Cauchy surfaces is applied to define a quantized version of gravitating point particles in 2+1 dimensions. We observe that this is the first model whose quantum version automatically discretizes time. But also spacelike distances are discretized in a very special way. 
"A slowly running technicolor coupling will affect the size of non-oblique corrections to the $Zb\bar b$ vertex from extended technicolor dynamics. We show that while ``walking technicolor'' reduces the magnitude of the corrections, they generally remain large enough to be seen at LEP. "
We define new quantizations of the Heisenberg group by introducing new quantizations in the universal enveloping algebra of its Lie algebra. Matrix coefficients of the Stone--von Neumann representation are preserved by these new multiplications on the algebra of functions on the Heisenberg group. Some of the new quantizations provide also a new multiplication in the algebra of theta functions; we obtain in this way Sklyanin algebras. 
"A classical solution to the Yang-Mills theory is given a new semiclassical interpretation in terms of particle scattering. It solves the complex time boundary value problem, which arises in the semiclassical approximation to a multi particle transition probability in the one-instanton sector at fixed energy. The imaginary part of the action of the solution on the complex time contour and its topological charge obey the same relation as the self-dual Euclidean configurations. Hence the solution is relevant for the problem of tunneling with fermion number violation in the electroweak theory. It describes transitions from an initial state with a smaller number of particles to a final state with a larger number of particles. The implications of these results for multi particle production in the electroweak theory are also discussed. "
Hamiltonian light-front dynamics of quantum fields may provide a useful approach to systematic non-perturbative approximations to quantum field theories. We investigate inequivalent Hilbert-space representations of the light-front field algebra in which the stability group of the light-front is implemented by unitary transformations. The Hilbert space representation of states is generated by the operator algebra from the vacuum state. There is a large class of vacuum states besides the Fock vacuum which meet all the invariance requirements. The light-front Hamiltonian must annihilate the vacuum and have a positive spectrum. We exhibit relations of the Hamiltonian to the nontrivial vacuum structure. 
"We develop a theory of photoluminescence using a time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximation that is appropriate for the two-dimensional Wigner crystal in a strong magnetic field. The cases of localized and itinerant holes are both studied. It is found that the photoluminescence spectrum is a weighted measure of the single particle density of states of the electron system, which for an undisturbed electron lattice has the intricate structure of the Hofstadter butterfly. It is shown that for the case of a localized hole, a strong interaction of the hole with the electron lattice tends to wipe out this structure. In such cases, a single final state is strongly favored in the recombination process, producing a single line in the spectrum. For the case of an itinerant hole, which could be generated in a wide quantum well system, we find that electron-hole interactions do not significantly alter the density of states of the Wigner crystal, opening the possibility of observing the Hofstadter gap spectrum in the electron density of states directly. At experimentally relevant filling fractions, these gaps are found to be extremely small, due to exchange effects. However, it is found that the hole, which interacts with the periodic potential of the electron crystal, has a Hofstadter spectrum with much larger gaps. It is shown that a finite temperature experiment would allow direct probing of this gap structure through photoluminescence. "
"We study the properties of ""generic"", in the sense of the Haar measure on the corresponding Grassmann manifold, subspaces of l^N_infinity of given dimension. We prove that every ""well bounded"" operator on such a subspace, say E, is a ""small"" perturbation of a multiple of identity, where ""smallness"" is defined intrinsically in terms of the geometry of E. In the opposite direction, we prove that such ""generic subspaces of l^N_infinity"" do admit ""nontrivial well bounded"" projections, which shows the ""near optimality"" of the first mentioned result, and proves the so called ""Pisier's dichotomy conjecture"" in the ""generic"" case. "
"We calculate the broadening of the transverse momentum distribution of a quark propagating through nuclear matter. Colour screening plays a fundamental role in that it cuts off quark-nucleon interactions with soft gluons. The mean transverse momentum of the quark acquired along its trajectory, observed via Drell-Yan pairs, is related to it the ratio of the total inelastic meson-nucleon cross section it to the meson mean squared radius. Parameter-free calculations agree with the data. "
"We consider the spherical limit of multi-matrix models on regular target graphs, for instance single or multiple Potts models, or lattices of arbitrary dimension. We show, to all orders in the low temperature expansion, that when the degree of the target graph $\Delta\to\infty$, the free energy becomes independent of the target graph, up to simple transformations of the matter coupling constant. Furthermore, this universal free energy contains contributions only from those surfaces which are made up of ``baby universes'' glued together into trees, all non-universal and non-tree contributions being suppressed by inverse powers of $\Delta$. Each order of the free energy is put into a simple, algebraic form. "
"Random boolean cellular automata are investigated, where each gate has two randomly chosen inputs and is randomly assigned a boolean function of its inputs. The effect of non-uniform distributions on the choice of the boolean functions is considered. The main results are that if the gates are more likely to be assigned constant functions than non-canalyzing functions, then with very high probability, the automaton will exhibit very stable behavior: most of the gates will stabilize, and the state cycles will be bounded in size. "
"$S$-matrices associated to the vector representations of the quantum groups for the classical Lie algebras are constructed. For the $a_{m-1}$ and $c_m$ algebras the complete $S$-matrix is found by an application of the bootstrap equations. It is shown that the simplest form for the $S$-matrix which generalizes that of the Gross-Neveu model is not consistent for the non-simply-laced algebras due to the existence of unexplained singularities on the physical strip. However, a form which generalizes the $S$-matrix of the principal chiral model is shown to be consistent via an argument which uses a novel application of the Coleman-Thun mechanism. The analysis also gives a correct description of the analytic structure of the $S$-matrix of the principle chiral model for $c_m$. "
"We show that a quantum deformation of quantum mechanics given in a previous work is equivalent to quantum mechanics on a nonlinear lattice with step size $\Delta x=~(1-q)x$. Then, based on this, we develop the basic formalism of quantum group Schr\""{o}dinger field theory in one spatial quantum dimension, and explicitly exhibit the $SU_{q}(2)$ covariant algebras satisfied by the $q$-bosonic and $q$-fermionic Schr\""{o}dinger fields. We generalize this result to an arbitrary number of fields. "
"In recent papers of the author, a method was developed for constructing quasitriangular Hopf algebras (quantum groups) of the quantum-double type. As a by-product, a novel non-standard example of the quantum double has been found. In the present paper, a closed expression (in terms of elementary functions) for the corresponding universal R-matrix is obtained. In reduced form, when the number of generators becomes two instead of four, this quantum group can be interpreted as a deformation of the Lie algebra [x,h]=2h in the context of Drinfeld's quantization program. "
"We describe the relationship between time-ordered and retarded response functions in a plasma. We obtain an expression, including the proper $i\epsilon$-prescription, for the induced current due to hard thermal loops in a non-Abelian theory, thus giving the non-Abelian generalization of the Kubo formula. The result is closely related to the eikonal for a Chern-Simons theory and is relevant for a gauge-invariant description of Landau damping in the quark-gluon plasma at high temperature. "
"We consider the role of chirally odd wave functions in hard exclusive reactions. Such wave functions have the quarks oriented in the opposite helicity configuration from those assumed in the short-distance limit and are generally associated with non-zero orbital angular momentum. Calculations in the impulse approximation allow for non-zero helicity flip amplitudes while the conventional factorization prescription for exclusive processes does not. By introducing a new approach, we show how helicity flip form factors are nevertheless calculable in QCD. "
"It is argued that color transparency in quasi elastic scattering of electrons and hadrons on nuclei is possible only due to Fermi-motion. We found a strong dependence of nuclear transparency on Bjorken x in (e,e'p), it is close to the Glauber model expectations at $x>1$, but increases and even exceeds one at $x<1$. It is argued that color transparency is accompanied by large longitudinal momentum transfer to nuclear matter during the passage of the small size wave packet. \vspace{\fill} "
"We report results from high-resolution particle-mesh (PM) N-body simulations of structure formation in an $\Omega=1$ cosmological model with a mixture of Cold plus Hot Dark Matter (C+HDM) having $\Omega_{\rm cold}=0.6$, $\Omega_\nu=0.3$, and $\Omega_{\rm baryon}=0.1$. We present analytic fits to the C+HDM power spectra for both cold and hot ($\nu$) components, which provide initial conditions for our nonlinear simulations. In order to sample the neutrino velocities adequately, these simulations included six times as many neutrino particles as cold particles. Our simulation boxes were 14, 50, and 200~Mpc cubes (with $H_0=50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$); we also did comparison simulations for Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in a 50~Mpc box. C+HDM with linear bias factor $b=1.5$ is consistent both with the COBE data and with the galaxy correlations we calculate. We find the number of halos as a function of mass and redshift in our simulations; our results for both CDM and C+HDM are well fit by a Press-Schechter model. The number density of galaxy-mass halos is smaller than for CDM, especially at redshift $z>2$, but the numbers of cluster-mass halos are comparable. We also find that on galaxy scales the neutrino velocities and flatter power spectrum in C+HDM result in galaxy pairwise velocities that are in good agreement with the data, and about 30\% smaller than in CDM with the same biasing factor. On scales of several tens of Mpc, the C+HDM streaming velocities are considerably larger than CDM. Thus C+HDM looks promising as a model of structure formation. "
"If a fourth generation of leptons exists, both the neutrino and its charged partner must be heavier than 45 GeV. We suppose that the neutrino is the heavier of the two, and that a global or discrete symmetry prohibits intergenerational mixing. In that case, non-renormalizable Planck scale interactions will induce a very small mixing; dimension five interactions will lead to a lifetime for the heavy charged lepton of $O(1-100)$ years. Production of such particles is discussed, and it is shown that a few thousands can be produced and collected at a linear collider. The possible uses of these heavy leptons is also briefly discussed. "
"Precision electroweak measurements at LEP currently check the validity of the Standard Model to about one part in a thousand. Any successful model of physics beyond the Standard Model must be consistent with these observations. The impact of radiative corrections on the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM) is considered. The influence of supersymmetric particles on precision electroweak measurements is generally negligible since radiative corrections mediated by supersymmetric particles are suppressed by a factor of order $m_Z^2/M_{\rm SUSY}^2$ (where $M_{\rm SUSY}$ is the scale characterizing the scale of supersymmetric particle masses). However, there are a few pertinent exceptions. For example, the radiative corrections to the rare decay $b\to s\gamma$ from charged Higgs and supersymmetric particle exchange can be of the same order as the Standard Model contribution. Large radiative corrections also lead to modifications of MSSM tree-level (natural) relations. The largest corrections of this type occur in the MSSM Higgs sector and are enhanced by powers of the top quark mass. The consequences of the radiatively corrected MSSM Higgs sector are briefly discussed. "
"We calculate the decay rate for a state prepared in a thermal density matrix centered on a metastable ground state. We find a rate that is intrinsically time {\it dependent}, as opposed to the {\it constant} rates of previous works. The rate vanishes at early times, rises to a maximum and eventually falls-off to zero as a consequence of unitary time evolution. Finally, we discuss extensions of this calculation to field theories and possible implications for both sphaleron mediated transitions and first order inflationary theories. "
"We investigate the possibility of kaon condensation in the dense interior of neutron stars through the s--wave interaction of kaons with nucleons. We include nucleon--nucleon interactions by using simple parametrizations of realistic forces, and include electrons and muons in $\beta$--equilibrium. The conditions under which kaon condensed cores undergo a transition to quark matter containing strange quarks are also established. The critical density for kaon condensation lies in the range (2.3--5.0)$~\rho_0$, where $\rho_0=0.16$~fm$^{-3}$ is the equilibrium density of nuclear matter. For too large a value of the strangeness content of the proton, matter with a kaon condensate is not sufficiently stiff to support the lower limit of $1.44 M_\odot$ for a neutron star. Kaon condensation dramatically increases the proton abundance of matter and even allows positrons to exist inside the core. We also consider the case when neutrinos are trapped in the matter. Neutrino trapping shifts both kaon condensation and the quark matter transition to higher densities than in the case of cold, catalyzed matter. A newly--formed neutron star is expected to have a rather low central density, the density rising only after mass accretion onto the star ends after a few seconds. Thus, it is likely that if kaon condensation and/or the quark--hadron phase transition occur, they do so only during or after the mass accretion and neutrino trapping stages. We suggest that neutrino observations from a galactic supernova may provide direct evidence for or against a condensate and/or a quark--hadron transition. "
"We study the half filled Hubbard model on a hypercubic lattice in infinite dimensions in the presence of a staggered magnetic field. An exact Ward-identity between vertex functions and self-energies is derived, that holds in any phase without broken symmetry for all values of $U$. Making the reasonable assumptions that for small enough on-site repulsion $U$ the high-temperature phase is a Fermi liquid, and that in the weak coupling regime the effective Anderson impurity model can be studied perturbatively, we proof that Hartree-Fock theory and the random-phase approximation are very accurate for small $U$, and that the system develops long-range antiferromagnetic order at a finite temperature. "
"This paper summarizes a research program that has been underway for a decade. The objective is to find a fast and accurate scheme for solving quantum problems which does not involve a Monte Carlo algorithm. We use an alternative strategy based on the method of finite elements. We are able to formulate fully consistent quantum-mechanical systems directly on a lattice in terms of operator difference equations. One advantage of this discretized formulation of quantum mechanics is that the ambiguities associated with operator ordering are eliminated. Furthermore, the scheme provides an easy way in which to obtain the energy levels of the theory numerically. A generalized version of this discretization scheme can be applied to quantum field theory problems. The difficulties normally associated with fermion doubling are eliminated. Also, one can incorporate local gauge invariance in the finite-element formulation. Results for some field theory models are summarized. In particular, we review the calculation of the anomaly in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (the Schwinger model). Finally, we discuss nonabelian gauge theories. "
"We consider a version of the notion of F-inverse semigroup (studied in the algebraic theory of inverse semigroups). We point out that an action of such an inverse semigroup on a locally compact space has associated a natural groupoid construction, very similar to the one of a transformation group. We discuss examples related to Toeplitz algebras on subsemigroups of discrete groups,to Cuntz-Krieger algebras, and to crossed-products by partial automorphisms in the sense of Exel. "
"Chiral vertex-operators are defined for continuous quantum-group spins $J$ from free-field realizations of the Coulomb-gas type. It is shown that these generalized chiral vertex operators satisfy closed braiding relations on the unit circle, which are given by an extension in terms of orthogonal polynomials of the braiding matrix recently derived by Cremmer, Gervais and Roussel. This leads to a natural extension of the Liouville exponentials to continuous powers that remain local. "
"We present an ab initio full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FLAPW) study of the structural and electronic properties of the two bulk unstable compounds FeSi (CsCl structure) and FeSi$_2$ (CaF$_2$ structure) which have recently been grown by molecular beam epitaxy on Si(111). We obtain equilibrium bulk lattice constants of 2.72 \AA\ and 5.32 \AA\ for FeSi and FeSi$_2$, respectively. The density of states (DOS) of FeSi agrees well with experiment, and shows metallic behavior. In agreement with a previous calculation the DOS of FeSi$_2$ shows a large density of $d$-states at the Fermi level, explaining the instability of the bulk phase. The electron charge distributions reveal a small charge transfer from Si to Fe atomic spheres in both compounds. While in FeSi the Fe-Si bond is indeed partially ionic, we show that in FeSi$_2$ the electron distribution corresponds to a covalent charge accumulation in the Fe-Si bond region. The reversed order of $d$-bands in FeSi with respect to FeSi$_2$ is understood in terms of crystal field splitting and Fe-Fe nearest neighbor $dd$-interactions in the CsCl structure, and a strong Si $p$/Fe $d$ bonding in the fluorite structure, respectively. "
"We compute the exact partition function for pure continuous Yang-Mills theory on the two-sphere in the large $N$ limit, and find that it exhibits a large $N$ third order phase transition with respect to the area $A$ of the sphere. The weak coupling (small A) partition function is trivial, while in the strong coupling phase (large A) it is expressed in terms of elliptic integrals. We expand the strong coupling result in a double power series in $e^{-g^2 A}$ and $g^2 A$ and show that the terms are the weighted sums of branched coverings proposed by Gross and Taylor. The Wilson loop in the weak coupling phase does not show the simple area law. We discuss some consequences for higher dimensions. "
"We have obtained spectra of the reflection nebulosity illuminated by two heavily embedded IRAS sources in the L1641 molecular cloud, Re 50 and IC 430 (V883 Ori). Examination of these spectra in combination with their other properties indicates that these objects are FU Orionis objects. Our spectrum of L1551 IRS 5 confirms the FU Ori classification made for this star by Mundt et al. (1985). "
We study the possibility of mixed dark matter obtained through the phase space distribution of a single particle. An example is offered in the context of SUSY models with a Peccei-Quinn symmetry. Axinos in the 100 keV range can naturally have both thermal and non-thermal components. The latter one arises from the lightest neutralino decays and derelativizes at z ~ 10^4. 
"The notion of a measure on the space of connections modulo gauge transformations that is invariant under diffeomorphisms of the base manifold is important in a variety of contexts in mathematical physics and topology. At the formal level, an example of such a measure is given by the Chern-Simons path integral. Certain measures of this sort also play the role of states in quantum gravity in Ashtekar's formalism. These measures define link invariants, or more generally multiloop invariants; as noted by Witten, the Chern-Simons path integral gives rise to the Jones polynomial, while in quantum gravity this observation is the basis of the loop representation due to Rovelli and Smolin. Here we review recent work on making these ideas mathematically rigorous, and give a rigorous construction of diffeomorphism-invariant measures on the space of connections modulo gauge transformations generalizing the recent work of Ashtekar and Lewandowski. This construction proceeds by doing lattice gauge theory on graphs analytically embedded in the base manifold. "
"A dynamical mechanism of symmetry breaking in which gauge and matter fields play an active role is proposed. It basically represents a covariant generalization of the mechanism responsible for superconductivity, and provides a {\em natural} mechanism of generation of mass which is not in conflict with the present value of the cosmological constant. When applied to SU(2)$\times$U(1) leads to exactly the same physics (Lagrangian density) as the Standard Model but modifying {\em only} the Higgs sector. It also predicts the appearance over all space of a classical scalar field as well as the existence of density fluctuations. According to it, space would be filled with a macroscopically large number of Higgs bosons which now appear as light, stable scalar particles {\em decoupled} from ordinary matter and radiation. Therefore they would play the same role as the Cooper pairs in superconductivity and would be a natural candidate for dark matter. "
"Drees and Godbole have proposed that, at the interaction point of an e+e- linear collider, one expects a high rate of hadron production by gamma-gamma collisions, providing an additional background to studies in e+e- annihilation. Using a simplified model of the gamma-gamma cross section with soft and jet-like components, we estimate the expected rate of these hadronic events for a variety of realistic machine designs. The final background rates are quite small, and they become smaller still when viewed with a realistic detector simulation. "
"The fine-tuning principles are analyzed in search for predictions of top-quark and Higgs-boson masses. The modification of Veltman condition based on the compensation between fermion and boson vacuum energies within the Standard Model multiplets is proposed. It is supplied with the stability under rescaling and with the requirement of minimum for the physical v. e. v. for the Higgs field (zero anomalous dimension). Their joint solution for top-quark and Higgs-boson couplings exists for the cutoff $\Lambda \approx 2.3 \cdot 10^{13}\,GeV$ that yields the low-energy values $m_t = 151 \pm 4\,GeV; m_H = 195 \pm 7\,GeV$. "
"One of the main features of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is the existence of an absolute tree-level upper bound $m_h$ on the mass of the $CP=+1$ lightest Higgs boson, equal to $m_Z$, that could affect detectability at future colliders. The above bound is spoiled by {\bf radiative corrections} and by an {\bf enlarged Higgs sector}, as {\em e.g.} a gauge singlet. Radiative corrections in the MSSM can push the upper bound up to $115\ GeV$ for $m_t \simlt 150\ GeV$. The presence of an enlarged Higgs sector changes the previous upper bound to one depending on the electroweak scale, $\tan \beta$ and the gauge and Yukawa couplings of the theory. When radiative corrections are included, the allowed region in the $(m_h,m_t)$ plane depends on the scale $\Lambda$ below which the theory remains perturbative. In particular, for models with arbitrary Higgs sectors and couplings saturating the scale $\Lambda=10^{16}\ GeV$ we find $m_h \simlt 155\ GeV$ and $m_t \simlt 190\ GeV$. "
"One loop corrections to the helicity amplitudes of all 2 -> 2 subprocesses are calculated in QCD and in N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory using two versions of dimensional regularization: the `t~Hooft-Veltman scheme and dimensional reduction. Studying the structure of the soft and collinear singularities, we found universal transition rules for the squared matrix element which can be used to translate the results obtained in these schemes to the results valid in the conventional dimensional regularization scheme. With explicit calculation it is demonstrated that the one loop helicity amplitudes of the 2 -> 2 subprocesses calculated using dimensional reduction in the N=1 supersymmetric $SU(N)$ gauge theory respect the supersymmetry Ward identities. Our transition rules can also be used to calculate the next-to-leading order Altarelli-Parisi kernels in the dimensional reduction scheme when they satisfy supersymmetry Ward identities as well. "
The importance of properly taking into account the factorization scheme dependence of parton distribution functions is emphasized. A serious error in the usual handling of this topic is pointed out and the correct procedure for transforming parton distribution functions from one factorisation scheme to another recalled. It is shown that the conventional $\overline{\rm {MS}}$ and DIS definitions thereof are ill-defined due to the lack of distinction between the factorisation scheme dependence of parton distribution functions and renormalisation scheme dependence of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. A novel definition of parton distribution functions is suggested and its role in the construction of consistent next-to-leading order event generators briefly outlined. 
We consider a set of gauge invariant terms in higher order effective Lagrangians of the strongly interacting scalar of the electroweak theory. The terms are introduced in the framework of the hidden gauge symmetry formalism. The usual gauge term is known to stabilize the skyrmion but only in the large vector mass limit. We find that adding higher-order gauge terms is insufficient to insure stability. We then proceed to analyze other gauge invariant interaction terms. Some of the conclusions also apply to QCD skyrmions. 
"We show that the LEP lower bound on the chargino mass, in conjunction with the well motivated theoretical requirement of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking, imply an upper bound on the lightest Higgs boson mass ($m_h\lsim62\GeV$) in a supersymmetry breaking scenario where the gluino mass is a few GeV. Moreover, Higgs searches at LEP in the context of this model require $m_h\gsim61\GeV$. The remaining experimentally allowed region in the five-dimensional parameter space of this light gluino model is severely fine-tuned (with $\tan\beta=1.88-1.89$ and $m_t=114.0-114.3\GeV$) and cosmologically troublesome (with a neutralino relic abundance over {\it five-hundred times larger than allowed}). Modest improvements in sensitivity in LEP Higgs searches and Tevatron top-quark searches should soon exclude this theoretically disfavored model completely. "
"We describe how isospin splitting and techniquark-technilepton splitting in one-family technicolor models can reduce the predicted value of the electroweak radiative correction parameter S, without making a large contribution to the T parameter. "
"Let K be an algebraic number field, O_K the ring of integers of K, and f : X --> Spec(O_K) an arithmetic surface. Let (E, h) be a rank r Hermitian vector bundle on X such that $E$ is semistable on the geometric generic fiber of f. In this paper, we will prove an arithmetic analogy of Bogomolov-Gieseker's inequality: c_2(E, h) - (r-1)/(2r) c_1(E, h)^2 >= 0. "
"We calculate the polarisation of $\psi$'s and $\Upsilon$'s produced by the fragmentation of heavy quarks. We find that fragmentation to transversely aligned quarkonium is slightly enhanced relative to longitudinally polarised. This net alignment corresponds to a $\sim 5\%$ asymmetry in the angular distribution of leptons produced in the subsequent decay of the quarkonium. We point out that the leading gluon contribution to $\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ production arises from the evolution of the charm quark fragmentation function, rather than from direct gluon fragmentation. "
It is shown that each integrable mapping is connected with a hierarchical completely integrable sytem of equations of evolution type which are invariant with respect to the transformation described by this mapping. 
"The universal field equations introduced by the author and his collaborators, which admit infinitely many inequivalent Lagrangian formulations are shown to arise as consistency conditions for the existence of non-trivial solutions to the quasi-linear equations, called equations of hydrodynamic type by Novikov , Dubrovin and others. The solutions in closed form are only implicit. A method due to Stokes, which is in essence just Fourier Analysis is resurrected for application to those equations. With the benefit of algebraic computation facilities, this method, allows the general structure of power series solutions to be conjectured. "
"In this paper, a generalization of standard spin fluctuation theory is considered which takes into account orbital degeneracy effects which are critical for describing f electrons. This theory leads to an instability for a superconducting pair state which obeys Hunds rules. Such a state has L=5, S=1, and J=4. The degeneracy of this state is broken by crystalline effects, and realistic calculations for $UPt_3$ find a resultant pair state with $\Gamma_6^-$ symmetry, consistent with current experimental constraints. "
"Possibilities of a model independent treatment of the data from future real-time solar neutrino experiments (SNO, Super-Kamiokande and others) are discussed. It is shown that in the general case of transitions of the initial solar $\nu_e$'s into $\nu_\mu$ and/or $\nu_\tau$ the total flux of initial $^8\mathrm{B}$ neutrinos and the $\nu_e$ survival probability can be determined directly from the experimental data. Relations between observable quantities are derived, which, if confronted with the experimental data, would allow to reveal the presence of sterile neutrinos in the solar neutrino flux on the earth. Neutrino transitions due to spin and resonant spin-flavour precession in the magnetic field of the sun are shortly discussed. "
"We demonstrate that the accretion disk model for the Galactic Center region by Linden et al (1993a) is applicable for at least one order of magnitude in radius from the Galactic Center (10 ... 100 pc). The viscosity $\nu$ is shown to be weakly dependent on the radius $s$: $\nu \sim s^{0.4}$. Finally, we discuss the influence of the inner boundary on the structure of the inner disk regions. "
"Coalescing binaries in distant galaxies are one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves detectable by the LIGO project.$^{[1-5]}$ They are also a copious source of neutrinos,$^{[1]}$ however these neutrino pulses are far too weak to be detected on earth. Several years ago Eichler \etal$\,$$^{[6]}$ suggested that they are also sources of $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs). Recently it was found$^{[7]}$ that GRBs are likely to be cosmological in origin, and coalescing binary systems$^{[6,8-11]}$ are probably the most promising cosmological sources. The current estimates of the burst and LIGO rates from a cosmologically distributed population are based on the systems observed in our galaxy.$^{[12-14]}$ These estimates are based on only three binarys so there are large statistical uncertainties in the coalescence rate. If we accept the cosmological/coalescing binary hypothesis for GRBs, then we get a more accurate estimate of the rate at which binaries coalesce and hence of the predicted LIGO signal. The association between GRBs and binaries can significantly improve the performance of LIGO. The detection of gravitational radiation from a GRB source not only confirms the coalescing binary model, but it will also provide information on the geometry and energy generation mechanism of the burst.

"Definitions of the control sequences included, but no other changes. "
The electromagnetic form factors of the proton in the time-like region and two-photon annihilations into proton-antiproton are investigated. To calculate these processes at moderately large $s$ we use a variant of the Brodsky-Lepage hard-scattering formalism where diquarks are considered as quasi-elementary constituents of baryons. The proton wave function and the parameters controlling the diquark contributions are determined from fits to space-like data. We also comment on the decay $\eta_c \to p\bar{p}$. 
We implement the concept of Wilson renormalization in the context of simple quantum mechanical systems. The attractive inverse square potential leads to a $\b$ function with a nontrivial ultraviolet stable fixed point and the Hulthen potential exhibits the crossover phenomenon. We also discuss the implementation of the Wilson scheme in the broader context of one dimensional potential problems. The possibility of an analogue of Zamolodchikov's $C$ function in these systems is also discussed. 
"We consider charged boson stars and study their effect on the structure of the vacuum. For very compact particle like ``stars"", with constituent mass $m_{*}$ close to the Planck mass $m_{Pl}$, i.e. $m_{*}^{2} = {\cal O} (\alpha m_{Pl}^{2})$, we argue that there is a limiting total electric charge $Z_c$, which, primarily, is due to the formation of a pion condensate ($Z_{c} \simeq 0.5\alpha^{-1}e$, where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant and $e$ is the electric charge of the positron). If the charge of the ``star"" is larger than $Z_c$ we find numerical evidence for a complete screening indicating a limiting charge for a very compact object. There is also a less efficient competing charge screening mechanism due to spontaneous electron-positron pair creation in which case $Z_{c} \simeq \alpha^{-1}e$. Astrophysical and cosmological abundances of charged compact boson stars are briefly discussed in terms of dark matter. "
We present a class of singularity free exact cosmological solutions of Einstein's equations describing a perfect fluid with heat flow. It is obtained as generalization of the Senovilla class [1] corresponding to incoherent radiation field. The spacetime is cylindrically symmetric and globally regular. 
"Nuclei are unique analyzers of the space-time development of jets at early stage. We argue that the gluon bremsstrahlung, rather than the color string, is the main mechanism of hadronization of highly virtual quarks produced in a hard interaction. It results in an energy- and time-independent density of energy loss, like a color string, but steeply dependent on the quark virtuality. Effects of formation zone (FZ) and color transparency (CT) substantially affect the jet quenching in a nuclear matter. The latter also plays an important role in the broadening of transverse momentum distribution of a quark passing a nucleus. Parameter-free calculations provide a good description of available data on nuclear effects in the leading hadron production in deep-inelastic lepton scattering, back-to-back high-$p_T$ hadron pair production, broadening of the transverse momentum distribution in the Drell-Yan process of lepton pair production on nuclei.

"In a previous paper $[$B,V-1$]$, an algebra of holomorphic ``perikernels'' on a complexified hyperboloid $ X^{(c)}_{d-1} $ (in $\Bbb C^d)$ has been introduced; each perikernel $ {\cal K} $ can be seen as the analytic continuation of a kernel $ {\bf K} $ on the unit sphere $ \Bbb S^{d-1} $ in an appropriate ``cut-domain'' , while the jump of $ {\cal K} $ across the corresponding ``cut'' defines a Volterra kernel $ K $ (in the sense of J. Faraut $\lbrack$Fa-1$\rbrack$) on the one-sheeted hyperboloid $ X_{d-1} $ (in $ \Bbb R^d). $ \par In the present paper, we obtain results of harmonic analysis for classes of perikernels which are invariant under the group $ {\rm SO}(d,\Bbb C) $ and of moderate growth at infinity. For each perikernel $ {\cal K} $ in such a class, the Fourier-Legendre coefficients of the corresponding kernel $ {\bf K} $ on $ \Bbb S^{d-1} $ admit a carlsonian analytic interpolation $ \tilde F(\lambda) $ in a half-plane, which is the ``spherical Laplace transform''\ of the associated Volterra kernel $K$ on $ X_{d-1}. $ Moreover, the composition law $ {\cal K }= {\cal K}_1\ast^{( c)}{\cal K}_2 $ for perikernels (interpreted in terms of convolutions for the "

A formalism is discussed which simplifies the calculation of Feynman diagrams at finite temperature. 
The possible conversion of neutron matter to strange matter and its relevance to astrophysical problems are discussed. Particular attention is paid to the {\it form} in which this hypothetical burning process should be propagated in dense matter and to the {\it moment} when it should start.

"We present a brief discussion of recent work on duality symmetries in non-trivial string backgrounds. Duality is obtained from a gauged non-linear sigma-model with vanishing gauge field strength. Standard results are reproduced for abelian gauge groups, whereas a new type of duality is identified for non--abelian gauge groups. Examples of duals of WZW models and 4-d black holes are given.

"Related to the classical Ashtekar Hamiltonian, there have been discoveries regarding new classical actions for gravity in (2+1)- and (3+1)-dimensions, and also generalizations of Einstein's theory of gravity. In this review, I will try to clarify the relations between the new and old actions for gravity, and also give a short introduction to the new generalizations. The new results/treatments in this review are: 1. A more detailed constraint analysis of the Hamiltonian formulation of the Hilbert- Palatini Lagrangian in (3+1)-dimensions. 2. The canonical transformation relating the Ashtekar- and the ADM-Hamiltonian in (2+1)-dimensions is given. 3. There is a discussion regarding the possibility of finding a higher dimensional Ashtekar formulation. There are also two clarifying figures (in the beginning of chapter 2 and 3, respectively) showing the relations between different action-formulations for Einstein gravity in (2+1)- and (3+1)-dimensions.

"Small number statistics may heavily affect the structure of the broadening function in integrated spectra of galactic globular cluster centers. As a consequence, it is a priori unknown how closely line broadening measure- ments gauge the intrinsic velocity dispersions at the cores of these stel- lar systems. We have tackled this general problem by means of Monte Carlo simulations. An examination of the mode and the frequency distribution of the measured values of the simulations indicates that the low value measured for the velocity dispersion of M30 (Zaggia etal 1992) is likely a reliable estimate of the velocity dispersion at the center of this cluster. The same methodology applied to the case of M15 suggests that the steep inward rise of the velocity dispersion found by Peterson, Seitzer and Cudworth (1989) is real, although less pronounced. Large-aperture observa- tions are less sensitive to statistical fluctuations, but are unable to detect strong variations in the dispersion wich occur within the aperture itself. "
"The COBE satellite's maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy do not have the resolution to discriminate between theories of cosmic structure formation based on inflation, and those based on field ordering following a symmetry breaking phase transition. For this purpose it is critical to resolve the CMB anisotropy on degree scales. In this paper we report on detailed calculations of the degree scale anisotropies predicted in the global string, monopole, texture and nontopological texture scenarios of structure formation, emphasising their distinct character from those predicted by inflation, and commenting on the prospects of their detection in the near future.

"A universal integrable hierarchy underlying topological Landau-Ginzburg models of D-tye is presented. Like the dispersionless Toda hierarchy, the new hierarchy has two distinct (``positive"" and ``negative"") set of flows. Special solutions corresponding to topological Landau-Ginzburg models of D-type are characterized by a Riemann-Hilbert problem, which can be converted into a generalized hodograph transformation. This construction gives an embedding of the finite dimensional small phase space of these models into the full space of flows of this hierarchy. One of flat coordinates in the small phase space turns out to be identical to the first ``negative"" time variable of the hierarchy, whereas the others belong to the ``positive"" flows. "
"The ""body fixed frame"" with respect to local gauge transformations is introduced. Rigid gauge ""rotations"" in QCD and their \Sch equation are studied for static and dynamic quarks. Possible choices of the rigid gauge field configuration corresponding to a nonvanishing static colormagnetic field in the ""body fixed"" frame are discussed. A gauge invariant variational equation is derived in this frame. For large number N of colors the rigid gauge field configuration is regarded as random with maximally random probability distribution under constraints on macroscopic--like quantities. For the uniform magnetic field the joint probability distribution of the field components is determined by maximizing the appropriate entropy under the area law constraint for the Wilson loop. In the quark sector the gauge invariance requires the rigid gauge field configuration to appear not only as a background but also as inducing an instantaneous quark-quark interaction. Both are random in the large N limit. "
"Bifurcation diagrams and plots of Lyapunov exponents in the $r$--$\Omega$ --plane for Duffing--type oscillators $$\ddot x +2r\dot x +V'(x,\Omega t) =0$$ exhibit a regular pattern of repeating selfsimilar ``tongues'' with complex internal structure. We demonstrate here that this behaviour is easily understood qualitatively and quantitatively from the Poincar\'e map of the system in action--angle variables. This map approaches the {\it one dimensional} form $$\varphi_{n+1} = A + C \e^{-r T} \cos \varphi_n, \ \ T= \pi / \Omega$$ provided $\e^{-r T}$ (but not necessarily $C \e^{- r T}$), $r$ and $\Omega$ are small. We derive asymptotic (for $r$, $\Omega$ small) formulae for $A$ and $C$ for a special class of potentials $V$. We argue that these special cases contain all the information needed to treat the general case of potentials which obey $V'' \ge 0$ at all times. The essential tools of the derivation are the use of action--angle variables, the adiabatic approximation and the introduction of a nonoscillating reference solution of Duffing's equation, with respect to which the action-angle variables have to be determined. These allow the explicit construction of the Poincar\'e map in powers of $\e^{-rT}$. To first order, we obtain the $\varphi$--map, which survives asymptotically. To {\it second} order we obtain the two--dimensional $I$--$\varphi$--map. In $I$--direction it contracts by a factor $\e^{-rT}$ upon each iteration. "
"Jet finding algorithms, as they are used in $e^+ e^-$ and hadron collisions, are reviewed and compared. It is suggested that a successive combination style algorithm, similar to that used in $e^+ e^-$ physics, might be useful also in hadron collisions, where cone style algorithms have been used previously. "
"We compute by numerical transfer-matrix methods the surface free energy $\tau(T),$ the surface stiffness coefficient $\kappa(T),$ and the single-step free energy $s(T)$ for Ising ferromagnets with $(\infty \times L)$ square-lattice and $(\infty \times L \times M)$ cubic-lattice geometries, into which an interface is introduced by imposing antiperiodic or plus/minus boundary conditions in one transverse direction. These quantities occur in expansions of the angle-dependent surface tension, either for rough or for smooth interfaces. The finite-size scaling behavior of the interfacial correlation length provides the means of investigating $\kappa(T)$ and $s(T).$ The resulting transfer-matrix estimates are fully consistent with previous series and Monte Carlo studies, although current computational technology does not permit transfer-matrix studies of sufficiently large systems to show quantitative improvement over the previous estimates. "
"We propose an experimental scheme to search for galactic halo axions with mass $m_a \sim 10^{-3}$eV, which is above the range accessible with cavity techniques. The detector consists of a large number of parallel superconducting wires embedded in a material transparent to microwave radiation. The wires carry a current configuration which produces a static, inhomogeneous magnetic field $\vec{B}_0(\vec{x})$ within the detector volume. Axions which enter this volume may convert to photons. We discuss the feasibility of the detector and its sensitivity. "
"The non-perturbative solution to the strong CP problem with magnetic monopoles as originally proposed by the author is described. It is shown that the gauge orbit space with gauge potentials and gauge tranformations restricted on the space boundary and the globally well-defined gauge subgroup in gauge theories with a $\theta$ term has a monopole structure if there is a magnetic monopole in the ordinary space. The Dirac's quantization condition then ensures that the vacuum angle $\theta$ in the gauge theories must be quantized to have a well-defined physical wave functional. The quantization rule for $\theta$ is derived as $\theta=0, 2\pi/n~(n\neq 0)$ with n being the topological charge of the magnetic monopole. Therefore, the strong CP problem is automatically solved with the existence of a magnetic monopole of charge $\pm 1$ with $\theta=\pm 2\pi$. This is also true when the total magnetic charge of monopoles are very large ($|n|\geq 10^92\pi$). The fact that the strong CP violation can be only so small or vanishing may be a signal for the existence of magnetic monopoles and the universe is open. "
We derive a new completely integrable dispersive shallow water equation that is biHamiltonian and thus possesses an infinite number of conservation laws in involution. The equation is obtained by using an asymptotic expansion directly in the Hamiltonian for Euler's equations in the shallow water regime. The soliton solution for this equation has a limiting form that has a discontinuity in the first derivative at its peak. 
"Quantum canonical transformations are defined algebraically outside of a Hilbert space context. This generalizes the quantum canonical transformations of Weyl and Dirac to include non-unitary transformations. The importance of non-unitary transformations for constructing solutions of the Schr\""odinger equation is discussed. Three elementary canonical transformations are shown both to have quantum implementations as finite transformations and to generate, classically and infinitesimally, the full canonical algebra. A general canonical transformation can be realized quantum mechanically as a product of these transformations. Each transformation corresponds to a familiar tool used in solving differential equations, and the procedure of solving a differential equation is systematized by the use of the canonical transformations. Several examples are done to illustrate the use of the canonical transformations. [This is an extensively revised version of hep-th-9205080: the first third of the paper is new material; the notation has been simplified, and further discussion has been added to the remainder.] "
"We consider the relationship between the conjectured uniqueness of the Moonshine Module, ${\cal V}^\natural$, and Monstrous Moonshine, the genus zero property of the modular invariance group for each Monster group Thompson series. We first discuss a family of possible $Z_n$ meromorphic orbifold constructions of ${\cal V}^\natural$ based on automorphisms of the Leech lattice compactified bosonic string. We reproduce the Thompson series for all 51 non-Fricke classes of the Monster group $M$ together with a new relationship between the centralisers of these classes and 51 corresponding Conway group centralisers (generalising a well-known relationship for 5 such classes). Assuming that ${\cal V}^\natural$ is unique, we then consider meromorphic orbifoldings of ${\cal V}^\natural$ and show that Monstrous Moonshine holds if and only if the only meromorphic orbifoldings of ${\cal V}^\natural$ give ${\cal V}^\natural$ itself or the Leech theory. This constraint on the meromorphic orbifoldings of ${\cal V}^\natural$ therefore relates Monstrous Moonshine to the uniqueness of ${\cal V}^\natural$ in a new way. "
"Time-delay mappings constructed using neural networks have proven successful in performing nonlinear system identification; however, because of their discrete nature, their use in bifurcation analysis of continuous-time systems is limited. This shortcoming can be avoided by embedding the neural networks in a training algorithm that mimics a numerical integrator. Both explicit and implicit integrators can be used. The former case is based on repeated evaluations of the network in a feedforward implementation; the latter relies on a recurrent network implementation. Here the algorithms and their implementation on parallel machines (SIMD and MIMD architectures) are discussed. "
"The effective kaon mass in dense baryonic matter is calculated based on PCAC, current algebra and the Weinberg smoothness hypothesis. The off-shell behavior of the K-N scattering amplitudes is treated consistently with PCAC, and the effects of the subthreshold K-N resonances are also included. The effective kaon mass is found to depend crucially on the K-N sigma term. Since the current estimates of K-N Sigma term are very uncertain, we discuss various scenarios treating K-N Sigma term as an input parameter; for certain values of K-N Sigma a collective mode of a hyperon-particle-nucleon-hole state appears at high densities, possibly leading to kaon condensation. "
Using Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits on the number of light neutrinos we derive a cosmological lower bound of $\approx 2$ TeV on the scale of extended technicolor interactions (or any other new interactions) for the third family in models where heavy gauge bosons couple to both left and right-handed neutrinos. 
"Using the conformal embedding on the torus, we can express some characters of $SU(3)_3$ in terms of $SO(8)_1$ characters. Then with the help of crossing symmetry, modular transformation and factorization properties of Green functions, we will calculate a class of correlators of $SU(3)_3$ on arbitrary Riemann surfaces. This method can apply to all $k>1$ WZW models which can be conformally embedded in some $k=1$ WZW models. "
The bihamiltonian structure of the N=2 Supersymmetric Boussinesq equation is found. It is not reduced to the corresponding classical structure and hence it describes the pure supersymmetric effect. For the supersymmetric Boussinesq equation which contains the classical partner the Lax pair is given explicitly. Thus we prove the integrability of the equation. 
"A classical solution to the Yang-Mills theory is given a new semiclassical interpretation. The boundary value problem on a complex time contour which arises from the semiclassical approximation to multiparticle scattering amplitudes is reviewed and applied to the case of Yang- Mills theory. The solution describes a classically for- bidden transition between states with a large average number of particles in the limit $g\rightarrow 0$. It dominates a transition probability with a semiclassical suppression factor equal to twice the action of the well- known BPST instanton. Hence, it is relevant to the pro- blem of high energy tunnelling. It describes transitions of unit topological charge for an appropriate time contour. Therefore, it may have a direct interpretation in terms of fermion number violating processes in electroweak theory. The solution describes a transition between an initial state with parametrically fewer particles than the final state. Thus, it may be relevant to the study of semiclassical initial state corrections in the limit of a small number of initial particles. The implications of these results for multiparticle production in electroweak theory are also discussed. "
"A three-dimensional weak coupling BCS model with an {\it anisotropic} pairing interaction in momentum space is reported. It exhibits an anisotropic gap in accord with recent experimental observations for high-$T_c$ oxides. The gap ratio ${2 \Delta / k_B T_c }$ is calculated as function of the anisotropy ratio of the electron pairing. It is found that the mean gap ratio decreases with increasing anisotropy of the electron pairing, whereas the maximum gap ratio increases. Assuming a unique strength of the effective electron interaction the transition temperature turns out to be always larger than in the isotropic case. The temperature dependence of the gap in the Cu-O plane and along the c-axis of YBaCuO is presented. "
"We investigate the low energy properties of string vacua with spontaneously broken $N=1$ supersymmetry by a dilaton $F$-term. As a consequence of the universal couplings of the dilaton, the supersymmetric mass spectrum is determined in terms of only three independent parameters and more constrained than in the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model. For a $\mu$-term induced by the \K\ potential the parameter space becomes two-dimensional; in the allowed regions of this parameter space we find that most supersymmetric particles are determined solely by the gluino mass. The Higgs is rather light and the top-quark mass always lower than 180 GeV. "
The bihamiltonian structure of the N=2 Supersymmetric Boussinesq equation is found. It is not reduced to the corresponding classical structure and hence it describes the pure supersymmetric effect. For the supersymmetric Boussinesq equation which contains the classical partner the Lax pair is given explicitely. Thus we prove the integrability of the equation. 
Periodicity and relaxation are investigated for the trajectories of the states in one-dimensional finite cellular automata with rule-90 and 150. The time evolutions are described with matrices. Eigenvalue analysis is applied to clarify the maximum value of period and relaxation. 
We report on a Monte-Carlo study of two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau superconductors in a magnetic field which finds clear evidence for a first-order phase transition characterized by broken translational symmetry of the superfluid density. A key aspect of our study is the introduction of a quantity proportional to the Fourier transform of the superfluid density which can be sampled efficiently in Landau gauge Monte-Carlo simulations and which satisfies a useful sum rule. We estimate the latent heat per vortex of the melting transition to be $\sim 0.38 k_B T_M$ where $T_M$ is the melting temperature. 
"Bennett et al. (PRL 70, 1859 (1993)) have shown how to transfer (""teleport"") an unknown spin quantum state by using prearranged correlated quantum systems and transmission of classical information. I will show how their results can be obtained in the framework of nonlocal measurements proposed by Aharonov and Albert I will generalize the latter to the teleportation of a quantum state of a system with continuous variables. "
"We suggest to use the common appearance of voids with a scale of $5000 \kms$ in the galaxy distribution to estimate the power spectrum on this scale. We use a simple model for a gravitational formation of voids and we compare the results with the matter fluctuations as constrained by the CMBR observations of COBE. We find that a power spectrum $P(k)\propto k^n$ with $n \approx 1.25$ is compatible both with COBE and with gravitational growth of large voids in an $\Omega=1$ universe. A Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum, $n=1$, normalized to produce the observed CMBR fluctuations, does not have enough power for gravitational growth of voids with a diameter of $5000 \kms$ in an $\Omega=1$ Universe. Such a spectrum would be compatible if (i) void diameters are smaller ($3500 \kms$), the voids are shallower or if the voids are rare (we assume that the universe is void filled); (ii) $\Omega < 1$ i.e. the Universe is open; (iii) galaxies do not trace matter on very large scale or if (iv) the voids do not grow gravitationally. "
"We show that macroscopic heterotic strings, formulated as strings which wind around a compact direction of finite but macroscopic extent, exhibit non-trivial scattering at low energies. This occurs at order velocity squared and may thus be described as geodesic motion on a moduli space with a non-trivial metric which we construct. Our result is in agreement with a direct calculation of the string scattering amplitude. "
"Let (A) and (B) be two first order structures of the same vocabulary. We shall consider the Ehrenfeucht-Fra{i}sse-game of length omega_1 of A and B which we denote by G_{omega_1}(A,B). This game is like the ordinary Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse-game of L_{omega omega} except that there are omega_1 moves. It is clear that G_{omega_1}(A,B) is determined if A and B are of cardinality <= aleph_1. We prove the following results: Theorem A: If V=L, then there are models A and B of cardinality aleph_2 such that the game G_{omega_1}(A,B) is non-determined. Theorem B: If it is consistent that there is a measurable cardinal, then it is consistent that G_{omega_1}(A,B) is determined for all A and B of cardinality <= aleph_2. Theorem C: For any kappa >= aleph_3 there are A and B of cardinality kappa such that the game G_{omega_1}(A,B) is non-determined. "
"We present in detail a formulation of the shell model as a path integral and Monte Carlo techniques for its evaluation. The formulation, which linearizes the two-body interaction by an auxiliary field, is quite general, both in the form of the effective `one-body' Hamiltonian and in the choice of ensemble. In particular, we derive formulas for the use of general (beyond monopole) pairing operators, as well as a novel extraction of the canonical (fixed-particle number) ensemble via an activity expansion. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the various formulations and ensembles and give several illustrative examples. We also discuss and illustrate calculation of the imaginary-time response function and the extraction, by maximum entropy methods, of the corresponding strength function. Finally, we discuss the ""sign-problem"" generic to fermion Monte Carlo calculations, and prove that a wide class of interactions are free of this limitation. "
"Non-local (alpha prime) corrections to Schwarzschild black holes are shown to invalidate the thermodynamical interpretation of black holes. In particular, the canonical and Bekenstein-Hawking temperatures are not equal. The particle number density of fields quantized in the (alpha prime modified) black hole background is no longer thermal. In the non-perturbative region (alpha prime going to infinity or mass going to zero), an analytic continuation to the number density is shown to vanish exponentially. "
"A numerical solution of a generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation in two dimensions reveals the existence of a spatio-temporal chaotic state comprised of a large number of rotating spirals. This state is observed for a reduced Rayleigh number $\epsilon=0.25$. The power spectrum of the state is isotropic, and the spatial correlation function decays exponentially, with an estimated decay length $\xi \approx 2.5 \lambda_{c}$, where $\lambda_{c}$ is the critical wavelength near the onset of convection. Our study suggests that this spiral defect state occurs for low Prandtl numbers and large aspect ratios. "
A tantalizing version of Maxwell's demon is presented which appears to operate reversibly. A container of hard core disks is separated into two chambers of equal volume by a membrane that selects which disk can penetrate depending on the disk's angle of incidence. It is shown that the second law of thermodynamics requires the incompressibility of microscopic dynamics or an appropriate energy cost for compressible microscopic dynamics. 
"The purpose of this paper is to analyse, in the light of information theory and with the arsenal of (elementary) quantum mechanics (EPR correlations, copying machines, teleportation, mixing produced in sub-systems owing to a trace operation, etc.) the scenarios available on the market to resolve the so-called black-hole information paradox. We shall conclude that the only plausible ones are those where either the unitary evolution of quantum mechanics is given up, in which information leaks continuously in the course of black-hole evaporation through non-local processes, or those in which the world is polluted by an infinite number of meta-stable remnants. "
"We discuss the relation between the CP symmetry and the custodial $SU(2)$ symmetry in the Higgs sector. In particular, we show that CP violation in the Higgs-gauge sector is allowed only if the custodial $SU(2)$ symmetry is broken. We exploit these facts to constrain CP violation using the experimental bounds on $\rho-1$. CP nonconservation in the Higgs-fermion interactions can also be constrained in a similar way although a possible exception is pointed out. "
Theorem: The topological partition relation omega^{*}-> (Y)^{1}_{2} (a) fails for every space Y with |Y| >= 2^c ; (b) holds for Y discrete if and only if |Y| <= c; (c) holds for certain non-discrete P-spaces Y ; (d) fails for Y= omega cup {p} with p in omega^{*} ; (e) fails for Y infinite and countably compact. 
"We derive the volume-averaged 2, 3, 4, and 5-point correlation functions from the moments of the Count probability distribution function of a redshift survey of IRAS galaxies, and find them all to be reasonably well-described by power laws. Weak systematic effects with the sample size provide evidence for stronger clustering of galaxies of higher luminosity on small scales. Nevertheless, remarkably tight relationships hold between the correlation functions of different order. In particular, the ``normalized"" skewness defined by the ratio $S_3\equiv \bar{\xi_3} / \bar{\xi_2}^2$ varies at most weakly with scale in the range $0.1 < \bar{\xi_2} < 10$. That is, $S_3$ is close to constant ($=1.5\pm 0.5$) from weakly to strongly non-linear scales. Furthermore, we find that the void probability function obeys a scaling relation with density to great precision, in accord with the scale-invariance hypothesis ($\bar{\xi_N}\propto\bar{\xi_2}^{N-1}$). "
Non-perturbative effects of instanton-like solutions are studied within the framework of supergravity theories with field-dependent gauge functions. Fermionic zero modes are constructed and some typical correlation functions are evaluated. The effects of instantons are very similar to those in globally supersymmetric theories: they preserve supersymmetry while breaking a chiral $U(1)$ symmetry. Non-perturbative amplitudes receive corrections which are suppressed at large distances. 
"We extend the work of Bielefeld, Fisher and Hubbard on Critical Portraits to the case of arbitrary postcritically finite polynomials. This determines an effective classification of postcritically finite polynomials as dynamical systems. This paper is the first in a series of two based on the author's thesis, which deals with the classification of postcritically finite polynomials. In this first part we conclude the study of critical portraits initiated by Fisher and continued by Bielefeld, Fisher and Hubbard. "
"We show that if 2^{aleph_0} Cohen reals are added to the universe, then for every reduced non-free torsion-free abelian group A of cardinality less than the continuum, there is a prime p so that Ext_p(A, Z) not= 0. In particular if it is consistent that there is a supercompact cardinal, then it is consistent (even with weak CH) that every coseparable group is free. The use of some large cardinal hypothesis is needed. "
"It is argued that the low-energy dynamics of $k$ monopoles in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are determined by an N=4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics based on the moduli space of $k$ static monople solutions. This generalises Manton's ``geodesic approximation"" for studying the low-energy dynamics of (bosonic) BPS monopoles. We discuss some aspects of the quantisation and in particular argue that dolbeault cohomology classes of the moduli space are related to bound states of the full quantum field theory. "
"We study the effects of chiral constituent molecules on the macroscopic shapes attained by lipid bilayer membranes. Such fluid membranes are beautiful examples of statistical ensembles of random shapes, sometimes coupled to in-plane order. We analyze them with methods of continuum elasticity theory, generalizing the well-known Canham-Helfrich model, and in particular incorporate the effects of thermal fluctuations. The condition that coordinate choice be immaterial greatly constrains the possible forms of the statistical weights in these systems, leading to very few independent couplings and hence physically simple models. Thermal fluctuations effectively reduce the chirality of a membrane at long scales, leading to an anomalous scaling relation for the radius of bilayer tubules and helices as a function of chirality. En route to this conclusion we develop a perturbative calculation scheme, paying particular attention to the functional measure needed to describe fluctuations covariantly. %% [In the new version some TeX problems are fixed.

"We calculate the electroweak corrections of the order $O({m_t^2\over v^2})$ to the QCD production of $t\bar{t}$ pairs via $q+qbar->t+tbar$ at hadron colliders and show that these corrections to the total production rate are small. This correction can be characterized as increasing the cross section most near the threshold region, where top quark signals are important, while the corrections become negative at higher $t\bar{t}$ energies where the top quark is a background for heavy Higgs boson searches or investigations involving the strongly interacting longitudinal $W$ system. The polarization of the $t\bar t$ pair is also discussed, including the effect that this has on proposed techniques for measuring the the top quark mass. "
"We studied the finite temperature phase transition of SU(2) gauge theory on four-dimensional Euclidean lattices by Monte Carlo simulations, and measured the flux distributions of a $q\bar q$ pair in both confined and unconfined phases. We reviewed and generalized Michael sum rules to include finite temperature effects. To compare our flux data with predictions of Michael sum rules, we studied the behavior of string tension with temperature. Our data agree well with the generalized sum rules. "
"Several aspects of classical and quantum mechanics applied to a class of strongly chaotic systems are studied. These consist of single particles moving without external forces on surfaces of constant negative Gaussian curvature whose corresponding fundamental groups are supplied with an arithmetic structure. It is shown that the arithmetic features of the considered systems lead to exceptional properties of the corresponding spectra of lengths of periodic orbits. The most significant one is an exponential growth of degeneracies in these length spectra. Furthermore, the arithmetical systems are distinguished by a structure that appears as a generalization of geometric symmetries. These pseudosymmetries occur in the quantization of the classical arithmetic systems as Hecke operators, which form an infinite algebra of self-adjoint operators commuting with the Hamiltonian. The statistical properties of quantum energies in the arithmetical have previously been identified as exceptional. They do not fit into the general scheme of random matrix theory. It is shown with the help of a simplified model for the spectral form factor how the spectral statistics in arithmetic quantum chaos can be understood by the properties of the corresponding classical length spectra. A decisive is played by the exponentially increasing multiplicities of lengths. The model developed for the level spacings distribution and for the number variance is compared to the corresponding quantities obtained from quantum energies for a specific arithmetical system. "
"A fermion mass matrix ansatz is proposed in the context of Grand Unified Supersymmetric Theories (GUTs). The fermion mass matrices are evolved down to the electroweak scale by solving the renormalization group equations for the gauge and Yukawa couplings. Eight inputs are introduced at the GUT scale to predict the 13 arbitrary parameters of the Standard model. The constraints imposed by the charged fermion data are used to make predictions in the neutrino sector. In particular, the neutrino mass matrix is worked out in the case of the flipped SU(5) model and it is found that the {\it generalized } see-saw mechanism which occurs naturally in this model can provide a solution to the solar neutrino puzzle and give a sufficiently large $\nu_{\tau}$ mass to contribute as a hot dark matter component as indicated by the recent COBE data. "
"We investigate the semileptonic decays of B and D mesons into $\pi$ and $\rho$ mesons, respectively, by means of QCD sum rules. We find that for the vector formfactors involved the pole dominance hypothesis is valid to good accuracy with pole masses in the expected range. Pole dominance, however, does not apply to the axial formfactors which results in specific predictions for the predominant polarization of the $\rho$ meson and the shape of the lepton spectrum. For the total decay rates we find $\Gamma (\bar B^0 \to \pi^+ e^- \bar\nu) = (5.1\pm 1.1)\,|V_{ub}|^2\, 10^{12}\,{\rm s^{-1}}$, $\Gamma ( D^0 \to \pi^- e^+ \nu) = (8.0\pm 1.7)\,|V_{cd}|^2\, 10^{10}\,{\rm s^{-1}}$, $\Gamma (\bar B^0 \to \rho^+ e^- \bar\nu) = (1.2\pm 0.4\,)\,|V_{ub}|^2\, 10^{13}\,{\rm s^{-1}}$ and $\Gamma (D^0 \to \rho^- e^+\nu) = (2.4\pm 0.7)\,|V_{cd}|^2\, 10^{9}\,{\rm s^{-1}}$. "
"We use a quite concrete and simple realization of $\slq$ involving finite difference operators. We interpret them as derivations (in the non-commutative sense) on a suitable graded algebra, which gives rise to the double of the projective line as the non commutative version of the standard homogeneous space. "
"A naive dimensional reduction of the $N=1, D=10$ supergravity theory that naturally arises in five-brane models is used to determine the r\^ole of two fields which are basic ingredients of string models: the dilaton and, among the moduli, the breathing mode. It is shown that, under the duality transformation that relates five-branes and strings, these two fields exchange the r\^oles of 10-dimensional dilaton and radius of the compact manifold. A description of this phenomenon in terms of the linear multiplets of the 4-dimensional supergravity is also presented. "
"Bosonic q-oscillators commute with themselves and so their free distribution is Planckian. In a cavity, their emission and absorption rates may grow or shrink---and even diverge---but they nevertheless balance to yield the Planck distribution via Einstein's equilibrium method, (a careless application of which might produce spurious q-dependent distribution functions). This drives home the point that the black-body energy distribution is not a handle for distinguishing q-excitations from plain oscillators. A maximum cavity size is suggested by the inverse critical frequency of such emission/absorption rates at a given temperature, or a maximum temperature at a given frequency. To remedy fragmentation of opinion on the subject, we provide some discussion, context, and references. "
We identify and calculate the instanton-induced contributions to deep inelastic scattering which correspond to nonperturbative exponential corrections to the coefficient functions in front of parton distributions of the leading twist. 
We rederive and discuss the result of the previous paper that in the standard model $\theta$-term related to $W$-boson field can not be induced by weak instantons. This follows from the existence of the fermion zero mode in the instanton field even when Yukawa couplings are switched on and there are no massless particles. We consider the new index theorem connecting the topological charge of the weak gauge field with the number of fermion zero modes of a certain differential operator which depends not only on gauge but also on Higgs fields. The possible generalizations of the standard model are discussed which lead to nonvanishing weak $\theta$-term. In $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ model the $\theta$ dependence of the vacuum energy is computed. 
We consider self-avoiding Nambu-Goto open strings on a random surface. We have shown that the partition function of such a string theory can be calculated exactly. The string susceptibility for the disk is evaluated to be $-\frac{1}{2}$. We also consider modifications of the Nambu-Goto action which are exactly soluble on a random surface. 
"An elastic anomaly, observed in the heavy fermi liquid state of Ce alloys (for example, CeCu$_6$ and CeTe), is analyzed by using the infinite-$U$ Anderson lattice model. The four atomic energy levels are assumed for f-electrons. Two of them are mutually degenerate. A small crystalline splitting $2\Delta$ is assumed between two energy levels. The fourfold degenerate conduction bands are also considered in the model. We solve the model using the mean field approximation to slave bosons, changing the Fermi energy in order to keep the total electron number constant. The nonzero value of the mean field of the slave bosons persists over the temperatures much higher than the Kondo temperature. This is the effect of the constant electron number. Next, the linear susceptibility with respect to $\Delta$ is calculated in order to obtain the renomalized elastic constant. The resulting temperature dependence of the constant shows the downward dip. We point out the relation of our finding with the experimental data. "
"We study classical $N=2$ super-$W_3$ algebra and its interplay with $N=2$ supersymmetric extensions of the Boussinesq equation in the framework of the nonlinear realization method and the inverse Higgs - covariant reduction approach. These techniques have been previously applied by us in the bosonic $W_3$ case to give a new geometric interpretation of the Boussinesq hierarchy. Here we deduce the most general $N=2$ super Boussinesq equation and two kinds of the modified $N=2$ super Boussinesq equations, as well as the super Miura maps relating these systems to each other, by applying the covariant reduction to certain coset manifolds of linear $N=2$ super-$W_3^{\infty}$ symmetry associated with $N=2$ super-$W_3$. We discuss the integrability properties of the equations obtained and their correspondence with the formulation based on the notion of the second hamiltonian structure. "
We prove that the deformed oscillator superalgebra $W_q(n)$ (which in the Fock representation is generated essentially by $n$ pairs of $q$-bosons) is a factor algebra of the quantized universal enveloping algebra $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$. We write down a $q$-analog of the Cartan-Weyl basis for the deformed $osp(1/2n)$ and give also an oscillator realization of all Cartan-Weyl generators. 
"The issue of de Sitter invariance for a massless minimally coupled scalar field is revisited. Formally, it is possible to construct a de Sitter invariant state for this case provided that the zero mode of the field is quantized properly. Here we take the point of view that this state is physically acceptable, in the sense that physical observables can be computed and have a reasonable interpretation. In particular, we use this vacuum to derive a new result: that the squared difference between the field at two points along a geodesic observer's space-time path grows linearly with the observer's proper time for a quantum state that does not break de Sitter invariance. Also, we use the Hadamard formalism to compute the renormalized expectation value of the energy momentum tensor, both in the O(4) invariant states introduced by Allen and Follaci, and in the de Sitter invariant vacuum. We find that the vacuum energy density in the O(4) invariant case is larger than in the de Sitter invariant case. "
"We consider a $SU(N)\times SU(M)$ generalization of the multichannel single-impurity Kondo model which we solve analytically in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, $M\rightarrow\infty$, with $\gamma=M/N$ fixed. Non-Fermi liquid behavior of the single electron Green function and of the local spin and flavor susceptibilities occurs in both regimes, $N\le M$ and $N > M$, with leading critical exponents {\em identical} to those found in the conformal field theory solution for {\em all} $N$ and $M$ (with $M\ge 2$). We explain this remarkable agreement and connect it to ``spin-flavor separation"", the essential feature of the non-Fermi-liquid fixed point of the multichannel Kondo problem. "
"Following recent work on the effective quantum action of gauged WZW models, we suggest such an action for {\it chiral} gauged WZW models which in many respects differ from the usual gauged WZW models. Using the effective action we compute the conformally exact expressions for the metric, the antisymmetric tensor, and the dilaton fields in the $\s$-model arising from a general {\it chiral } gauged WZW model. We also obtain the general solution of the geodesic equations in the exact geometry. Finally we consider in some detail a three dimensional model which has certain similarities with the three dimensional black string model. Finally we consider in some detail a three dimensional model which has certain similarities with the three dimensional black string model. "
"Parity violation is a long standing problem in light-cone quantization. \REF\CPT{D. Soper, SLAC-REP-137, 1970, Chap. I . } \refend We propose a new quantization on the light-cone which treats both the $x^{+}$ and the $x^{-}$ coordinates as light-cone 'times.'This quantization respects both parity and time-reversal. We find that now both $P^{-}$ and $P^{+}$ become dynamical. "
We re-evaluate the matrix element for the proton-proton reaction which is important for stellar-evolution calculations and for the solar-neutrino problem. We self-consistently determine the effect of vacuum polarization on the matrix element by first correcting the low-energy scattering data to account for vacuum polarization. We then calculate the proton-proton wave function by integrating the Schrodinger equation with vacuum polarization included. We use improved data for proton-proton scattering and for the deuteron wave function. We evaluate the uncertainties that are due to experimental error and estimate those that are due to theoretical inadequacies. We estimate the theoretical uncertainty by using six different deuteron potentials and five different proton-proton potentials. Vacuum polarization decreases the calculated value by $0.6_{-0.4}^{+0.1}$\%. The complete result is $\Lambda^2=6.92\times(1\pm0.002^{+0.014}_{-0.009})$ where the first uncertainty is due to experimental errors and the second uncertainty is due to theoretical uncertainties. Our value of $\Lambda^2$ is 2\% smaller than the value obtained in 1969 by Bahcall and May. The improved calculations of the rate of the $pp$ reaction described here increase slightly the predicted event rates for the chlorine and the Kamiokande solar-neutrino experiments. 
"We calculate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe which would arise during a first order electroweak phase transition due to minimal standard model processes. It agrees in sign and magnitude with the observed baryonic excess, for resonable KM parameters and m$_t$ in the expected range, and plausible values of bubble velocity and other high temperature effects. A detailed version of this work (77pp) is being simultaneously submitted to the net. A shortened version of this recently appeared in Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 70}, 2833, 1993. "
The leading heavy-top two-loop corrections to the \Zbb~vertex are determined from a direct evaluation of the corresponding Feynman diagrams in the large \Mt~limit. %The calculation is done in the naive %dimensional regularization scheme with anticommuting $\ga_5$. The leading one-loop top-mass effect is enhanced by $[1+\GF\Mt^2(9-\pi^2/3)/(8\pi^2\sqrt{2})]$. Our calculation confirms a recent result of Barbieri et al. 
"We reconsider the problem of anyons on higher genus surfaces by embedding them in three dimensional space. From a concrete realization based on three dimensional flux tubes bound to charges moving on the surface, we explicitly derive all the representations of the spinning braid group. The component structure of the wave functions arises from winding the flux tubes around the handles. We also argue that the anyons in our construction must fulfil the generalized spin-statistics relation. "
"We present structural properties of two-dimensional polymers as far as they can be described by percolation theory. The percolation threshold, critical exponents and fractal dimensions of clusters are determined by computer simulation and compared to the results of percolation theory. We also describe the dependence of the typical cluster structures on the reaction rate. "
"We extend spacetime duality to superspace, including fermions in the low-energy limits of superstrings. The tangent space is a curved, extended superspace. The geometry is based on an enlarged coordinate space where the vanishing of the d'Alembertian is as fundamental as the vanishing of the curl of a gradient. "
"We study the interactions of quarks and antiquarks with the changing Higgs field during the electroweak phase transition, including quantum mechanical and some thermal effects, with the only source of CP violation being the known CKM phase. The magnitude and sign of the predicted BAU agrees with the observed value, with moderately optimistic assumptions about the dynamics of the phase transition. At present uncertainties related to the dynamics of the ew phase transition and the oversimplifications of our treatment are too great to decide whether or not this is the correct explanation for the presence of remnant matter in our universe, however the present work makes it clear that the minimal standard model cannot be discounted as a contender for explaining this phenomenon. "
"The affine-Virasoro Ward identities are a system of non-linear differential equations which describe the correlators of all affine-Virasoro constructions, including rational and irrational conformal field theory. We study the Ward identities in some detail, with several central results. First, we solve for the correlators of the affine-Sugawara nests, which are associated to the nested subgroups $g\supset h_1 \supset \ldots \supset h_n$. We also find an equivalent algebraic formulation which allows us to find global solutions across the set of all affine-Virasoro constructions. A particular global solution is discussed which gives the correct nest correlators, exhibits braiding for all affine-Virasoro correlators, and shows good physical behavior, at least for four-point correlators at high level on simple $g$. In rational and irrational conformal field theory, the high-level fusion rules of the broken affine modules follow the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the representations. "
"An analysis of errors in measurement yields new insight into the penetration of quantum particles into classically forbidden regions. In addition to ``physical"" values, realistic measurements yield ``unphysical"" values which, we show, can form a consistent pattern. An experiment to isolate a particle in a classically forbidden region obtains negative values for its kinetic energy. These values realize the concept of a {\it weak value}, discussed in previous works. "
"We show that many spaces that look like the half~line~$\halfline=[0,\infty)$ have, under~$\CH$, a \v{C}ech-Stone-remainder that is homeomorphic to~$\Hstar$. We also show that $\CH$ is equivalent to the statement that all standard subcontinua of~$\Hstar$ are homeomorphic. The proofs use Model-theoretic tools like reduced products and elementary equivalence; rather than constructing homeomorphisms we show that the spaces in question have isomorphic bases for the closed sets. "
"Models of electroweak symmetry breaking with more than a single doublet of Higgs scalars contain a neutral pseudoscalar boson. The production of such a pseudoscalar in hadron collisions proceeds primarily via gluon fusion through a top-quark loop (except for those models in which the pseudoscalar coupling to bottom quarks is strongly enhanced). We compute the QCD corrections to this process in the heavy-quark limit, using an effective Lagrangian derived from the axial anomaly. "
Summary: A system of autonomous ordinary differential equations depending on a small parameter is considered such that the unperturbed system has an invariant manifold of periodic solutions that is not normally hyperbolic but is normally nondegenerate. The bifurcation function whose zeros are the bifurcation points for families of perturbed periodic solutions is determined. This result is applied to find the periodic solutions near resonance for a two degree of freedom mechanical system modeling a rotor interacting with an elastic support. 
"We discuss neutrino oscillations in the framework of the quantum field theory without introducing the concept of neutrino weak eigenstates. The external particles are described by wave packets and the different mass eigenstate neutrinos propagate between the production and detection interactions, which are macroscopically localized in space-time. The time-averaged cross section, which is the measurable quantity in the usual experimental setting, is calculated. It is shown that only in the extremely relativistic limit the usual quantum mechanical oscillation probability can be factored out of the cross section. "
"We reanalyze the extraction of the heavy Higgs boson signal $H\rightarrow W^+W^-\rightarrow \bar\ell\nu,\ell\bar\nu$ $(\ell=e\hbox{ or }\mu)$ from the Standard Model background at hadron supercolliders, taking into account revised estimates of the top quark background. With new acceptance criteria the detection of the signal remains viable. Requiring a forward jet-tag, a central jet-veto, and a large relative transverse momentum of the two charged leptons yields $S/\sqrt B>6$ for one year of running at the SSC or LHC. "
"We show that for a large range of parameters in a $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$ electroweak theory with two Higgs doublets there may exist classically stable flux tubes of Z boson magnetic field. In a limit of an extra global $\tilde U(1)$ symmetry, these flux-tubes become topologically stable. These results are automatically valid even if $\tilde U(1)$ is gauged. "
"Within a general cluster framework, we discuss the loop-algorithm, a new type of cluster algorithm that reduces critical slowing down in vertex models and in quantum spin systems. We cover the example of the 6-vertex model in detail. For the F-model, we present numerical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the loop algorithm. We discuss how to modify the original algorithm for some more complicated situations, especially for quantum spin systems in one and two dimensions. "
"We discuss the possibility that heavy fermion superconductors involve odd-frequency pairing of the kind first considered by Berezinskii. Using a toy model for odd frequency triplet pairing in the Kondo lattice we are able to examine key properties of this new type of paired state. To make progress treating the strong $n_f=1$ constraint in the Kondo lattice model we use the technical trick of a Majorana representation of the local moments, which permits variational treatments of the model without a Gutzwiller approximation. The simplest mean field theory involves the development of bound states between the local moments and conduction electrons, characterized by a spinor order parameter. We show that this state is a stable realization of odd frequency triplet superconductivity with surfaces of gapless excitations whose spin and charge coherence factors vanish linearly in the quasiparticle energy. A $T^3$ NMR relaxation rate coexists with a linear specific heat. We discuss possible extensions of our toy model to describe heavy fermion superconductivity. "
"Regression with $\chi^2$ constructed from the covariance matrix should not be used for some combinations of covariance matrices and fitting functions. Using the technique for unsuitable combinations can amplify systematic errors. This amplification is uncontrolled, and can produce arbitrarily inaccurate results that might not be ruled out by a $\chi^2$ test. In addition, this technique can give incorrect (artificially small) errors for fit parameters. I give a test for this instability and a more robust (but computationally more intensive) method for fitting correlated data. "
"Hawking has shown that the emission of gravitational radiation cannot prevent circular loops of gauged cosmic strings from collapsing into black holes. Here we consider the corresponding question for global strings: can Goldstone boson emission prevent circular loops of global cosmic strings from forming black holes? Our results show that for every value of the string tension there is a certain critical size below which the circular loop does not collapse to form a black hole. For GUT scale strings, this critical size is much larger than the current horizon. "
"The paper describes the quantization of the SU(3) smibosonized Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and results for mass splittings, including isospin splittings, and axial couplings. The agreement with the data is surprisingly good. "
"Within the context of an effective potential formalism we calculate the contribution to Higgs boson masses in the next--to--minimal supersymmetric standard model from squark loops. We then supplement a previously performed renormalisation group analysis of the Higgs sector of this model with these results in order to determine the shift in the bound on the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass as a result of squark effects. The improved bound on the lightest neutral CP-even Higgs boson mass, including squark contributions, is $m_h \leq 146 \ \ (139, 149)$ GeV for $m_t = 90 \ \ (140, 190)$ GeV. For $m_t = 190$ GeV squark effects contribute 23 GeV to the bound, with smaller contributions for small $m_t$ values. "
"There exists the possibility that the cross-section for the nonperturbative production of many, ${\cal O}(\alpha_W^{-1} \simeq 30 )$, weak gauge bosons may be as large as ${\cal O}(100\ {\rm pb}\ -\ 10\ \mu$b$)$ above a parton-parton center-of-mass threshold in the range $2.4\ -\ 30$ TeV. We review the theoretical considerations which lead to this suggestion and outline its phenomenological implications, both for present cosmic ray as well as for future collider experiments.

We report experiments on convection patterns in a cylindrical cell with a large aspect ratio. The fluid had a Prandtl number of approximately 1. We observed a chaotic pattern consisting of many rotating spirals and other defects in the parameter range where theory predicts that steady straight rolls should be stable. The correlation length of the pattern decreased rapidly with increasing control parameter so that the size of a correlated area became much smaller than the area of the cell. This suggests that the chaotic behavior is intrinsic to large aspect ratio geometries. 
"We analyze transition potentials $(V(r) \stackrel{r\sim 0}{\rightarrow} {\alpha r^{-2}})$ in non-relativistic quantum mechanics using the techniques of supersymmetry. For the range $-1/4 < \alpha < 3/4$, the eigenvalue problem becomes ill-defined (since it is not possible to choose a unique eigenfunction based on square integrability and boundary conditions). It is shown that supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM) provides a natural prescription for a unique determination of the spectrum. Interestingly, our SUSYQM based approach picks out the same ""less singular"" wave functions as the conventional approach, and thus provides a simple justification for the usual practice in the literature. Two examples (the P\""oschl-Teller II potential and a two anyon system on the plane) have been worked out for illustrative purposes. "
"The hydrodynamic stability of deflagration and detonation bubbles for a first order electroweak and QCD phase transition has been discussed recently with the suggestion that detonations are stable. We examine here the case of a detonation more carefully. We find that in front of the bubble wall perturbations do not grow with time, but behind the wall modes exist which grow exponentially. We briefly discuss the possible meaning of this instability. "
"In the standard model with two Higgs doublets it is shown that the existence of the electroweak Z-string in general requires the same characteristic length for the two Higgs fields as well as a specific ratio of the two Higgs vacuum expectation values, i.e. $\tan\beta$. This ratio can be determined in terms of the couplings in the Higgs potential. Some remarks on the supersymmetric case are given. \noindent (Talk presented at SUSY '93, March 29-April 1st, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, USA.) "
"Exact solutions of heterotic string theory corresponding to four-dimensional charge Q magnetic black holes are constructed as tensor products of an SU(2)/Z(2Q+2) WZW orbifold with a (0,1) supersymmetric SU(1,1)/U(1) WZW coset model. The spectrum is analyzed in some detail. ``Bad'' marginal operators are found which are argued to deform these theories to asymptotically flat black holes. Surprising behaviour is found for small values of Q, where low-energy field theory is inapplicable. At the minimal value Q=1, the theory degenerates. Renormalization group arguments are given that suggest the potential gravitational singularity of the low-energy field theory is resolved by a massive two-dimensional field theory. At Q=0, a stable, neutral ``remnant,'' of potential relevance to the black hole information paradox, is found. "
"The cross section for photon neutrino scattering is calculated in the standard model assuming that the neutrino is massless and that the center of mass energy is small compared to any charged lepton mass. Although the scattered photons can acquire a (parity violating) circular polarization of order unity, the cross section in this limit is highly suppressed. "
We study flows on the space of topological Landau-Ginzburg theories coupled to topological gravity. We argue that flows corresponding to gravitational descendants change the target space from a complex plane to a punctured complex plane and lead to the motion of punctures.It is shown that the evolution of the topological theory due to these flows is given by dispersionless limit of KP hierarchy. We argue that the generating function of correlators in such theories are equal to the logarithm of the tau-function of Generalized Kontsevich Model. 
"The spin structure of the pion is discussed by transforming the wave function for the pion in the naive quark model into a light-cone representation. It is shown that there are higher helicity ($\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2}=\pm1$) states in the full light-cone wave function for the pion besides the ordinary helicity ($\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2}=0$) component wave functions as a consequence from the Melosh rotation relating spin states in light-front dynamics and those in instant-form dynamics. Some low energy properties of the pion, such as the electromagnetic form factor, the charged mean square radius, and the weak decay constant, could be interrelated in this representation with reasonable parameters. "
"To investigate the cosmic no hair conjecture, we analyze numerically 1-dimensional plane symmetrical inhomogeneities due to gravitational waves in vacuum spacetimes with a positive cosmological constant. Assuming periodic gravitational pulse waves initially, we study the time evolution of those waves and the nature of their collisions. As measures of inhomogeneity on each hypersurface, we use the 3-dimensional Riemann invariant ${\cal I}\equiv {}~^{(3)\!}R_{ijkl}~^{(3)\!}R^{ijkl}$ and the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor. We find a temporal growth of the curvature in the waves' collision region, but the overall expansion of the universe later overcomes this effect. No singularity appears and the result is a ``no hair"" de Sitter spacetime. The waves we study have amplitudes between $0.020\Lambda \leq {\cal I}^{1/2} \leq 125.0\Lambda$ and widths between $0.080l_H \leq l \leq 2.5l_H$, where $l_H=(\Lambda/3)^{-1/2}$, the horizon scale of de Sitter spacetime. This supports the cosmic no hair conjecture. "
"A nonperturbative approach to quantum gravity that has generated much discussion is the attempt to construct a ``loop representation."" Despite it's success in linear quantum theories and a part of 2+1 quantum gravity, it has recently been noticed that difficulties arise with loop representations in a different ``sector"" of 2+1 gravity. The problems are related to the use of the ``loop transform"" in the construction of the loop representation. We illustrate these difficulties by exploring an analogy based on the Mellin transform which allows us to work in a context that is both mathematically and physically simple and that does not require an understanding either of loop representations or of 2+1 gravity. "
"We construct and classify topological lattice field theories in three dimensions. After defining a general class of local lattice field theories, we impose invariance under arbitrary topology-preserving deformations of the underlying lattice, which are generated by two new local lattice moves. Invariant solutions are in one--to--one correspondence with Hopf algebras satisfying a certain constraint. As an example, we study in detail the topological lattice field theory corresponding to the Hopf algebra based on the group ring $\C[G]$, and show that it is equivalent to lattice gauge theory at zero coupling, and to the Ponzano--Regge theory for $G=$SU(2). "
"Observations from the first flight of the Medium Scale Anisotropy Measurement (MSAM) are analyzed to place limits on Gaussian fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR). This instrument chops a 30\arcmin\ beam in a 3 position pattern with a throw of $\pm40\arcmin$; the resulting data is analyzed in statistically independent single and double difference datasets. We observe in four spectral channels at 5.6, 9.0, 16.5, and 22.5~\icm, allowing the separation of interstellar dust emission from CMBR fluctuations. The dust component is correlated with the \IRAS\ 100~\micron\ map. The CMBR component has two regions where the signature of an unresolved source is seen. Rejecting these two source regions, we obtain a detection of fluctuations which match CMBR in our spectral bands of $0.6 \times 10^{-5} < \Delta T/T < 2.2 \times 10^{-5}$ (90\% CL interval) for total rms Gaussian fluctuations with correlation angle 0\fdg5, using the single difference demodulation. For the double difference demodulation, the result is $1.1 \times 10^{-5} < \Delta T/T < 3.1 \times 10^{-5}$ (90\% CL interval) at a correlation angle of 0\fdg3. "
"We study the integrability properties of the one-parameter family of $N=2$ super Boussinesq equations obtained earlier by two of us (E.I. \& S.K., Phys. Lett. B 291 (1992) 63) as a hamiltonian flow on the $N=2$ super-$W_3$ algebra. We show that it admits nontrivial higher order conserved quantities and hence gives rise to integrable hierarchies only for three values of the involved parameter, $\alpha=-2,\;-1/2,\;5/2$. We find that for the case $\alpha = -1/2$ there exists a Lax pair formulation in terms of local $N=2$ pseudo-differential operators, while for $\alpha = -2$ the associated equation turns out to be bi-hamiltonian. "
"We present the results of a study of the three-dimensional $XY$-model on a simple cubic lattice using the single cluster updating algorithm combined with improved estimators. We have measured the susceptibility and the correlation length for various couplings in the high temperature phase on lattices of size up to $L=112$. At the transition temperature we studied the fourth-order cumulant and other cumulant-like quantities on lattices of size up to $L=64$. From our numerical data we obtain for the critical coupling $\coup_c=0.45420(2)$, and for the static critical exponents $\gamma /\nu=1.976(6)$ and $\nu=0.662(7)$. "
"We consider quantization of the positive curvature Friedmann cosmology in the unimodular modification of Einstein's theory, in which the spacetime four-volume appears as an explicit time variable. The Hamiltonian admits self-adjoint extensions that give unitary evolution in the Hilbert space associated with the Schr\""odinger equation. The semiclassical estimate to the no-boundary wave function of Hartle and Hawking is found. If this estimate is accurate, there is a continuous flux of probability into the configuration space from vanishing three-volume, and the no-boundary wave function evolves nonunitarily. Generalizations of these results hold in a class of anisotropic cosmologies. (Talk given at the 5th Canadian Conference on General Relativity and Relativistic Astrophysics, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, May 1993.) "
Certain phase space path integrals can be evaluated exactly using equivariant cohomology and localization in the canonical loop space. Here we extend this to a general class of models. We consider hamiltonians which are {\it a priori} arbitrary functions of the Cartan subalgebra generators of a Lie group which is defined on the phase space. We evaluate the corresponding path integral and find that it is closely related to the infinitesimal Lefschetz number of a Dirac operator on the phase space. Our results indicate that equivariant characteristic classes could provide a natural geometric framework for understanding quantum integrability. 
"In this paper a relativistic quantum theory introduced by de Groot and \mbox{Ruijgrok} in 1975, is used as a quark model in momentum space. The complete spectrum, with the exception of the selfconjugate light unflavoured mesons, is calculated. The potential used consists of an one-gluon-exchange (OGE) part and a confining part. For the confining part a relativistic generalization of the linear plus constant potential was used, which is well-defined in momentum space without introducing any singularities. For the OGE part several potentials were investigated. Retardations were included at all places. Using a fitting procedure involving 52 well-established mesons, best results were obtained for a potential consisting of a purely vector Richardson potential and a purely scalar confining potential. In this way a vector confining is entirely induced by the Richardson potential. Reasonable results were also obtained for a modified Richardson potential. Most meson masses, with the exception of the $\pi$, the $K$ and the $K_0^*$, were found to be reasonably well described by the model. "
I give a sufficient condition for a relativistic front-form quantum mechanical model to be scattering equivalent (unitarily equivalent with the same S-matrix elements) to a relativistic front-form quantum model with an interaction-independent front-form spin. 
"We study the class of generalized Korteweg-DeVries equations derivable from the Lagrangian: $ L(l,p) = \int \left( \frac{1}{2} \vp_{x} \vp_{t} - { {(\vp_{x})^{l}} \over {l(l-1)}} + \alpha(\vp_{x})^{p} (\vp_{xx})^{2} \right) dx, $ where the usual fields $u(x,t)$ of the generalized KdV equation are defined by $u(x,t) = \vp_{x}(x,t)$. This class contains compactons, which are solitary waves with compact support, and when $l=p+2$, these solutions have the feature that their width is independent of the amplitude. We consider the Hamiltonian structure and integrability properties of this class of KdV equations. We show that many of the properties of the solitary waves and compactons are easily obtained using a variational method based on the principle of least action. Using a class of trial variational functions of the form $u(x,t) = A(t) \exp \left[-\beta (t) \left|x-q(t) \right|^{2n} \right]$ we find soliton-like solutions for all $n$, moving with fixed shape and constant velocity, $c$. We show that the velocity, mass, and energy of the variational travelling wave solutions are related by $ c = 2 r E M^{-1}$, where $ r = (p+l+2)/(p+6-l)$, independent of $n$.\newline \newline PACS numbers: 03.40.Kf, 47.20.Ky, Nb, 52.35.Sb "
"We introduce two simple two-dimensional lattice models to study traffic flow in cities. We have found that a few basic elements give rise to the characteristic phase diagram of a first-order phase transition from a freely moving phase to a jammed state, with a critical point. The jammed phase presents new transitions corresponding to structural transformations of the jam. We discuss their relevance in the infinite size limit. "
"The rates of the rare flavor-changing processes, $b \rightarrow s \gamma$ and $B_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$ are estimated in extended technicolor models with and without a GIM mechanism. We find the $b \rightarrow s \gamma$ rate in ETC models with a GIM mechanism to be at most slightly larger than the standard model rate, whereas there is no significant extra model-independent contribution in other ETC scenarios. In the case of $B_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$, ETC models with a GIM mechanism can yield a rate up to two orders of magnitude bigger than that of the standard model, whereas generic ETC scenarios are likely to give a rate which is about an order of magnitude bigger than that of the standard model. "
"Color transparency (CT) is an effect of suppression of nuclear shadowing of hard reactions, closely related to the color screening. A brief review of theoretical development and experimental search for CT, failed and successful, are presented. A special emphasis is made on a quantum-mechanical nature of CT, as opposed to a wide spread erroneousclassical treatment of this phenomenon. The typical predictions of the classical approach, all contradicting quantum mechanics are: - factorization of cross section of hard reactions on a nucleus;\\ - ""nuclear transparency"", a normalized ratio of nuclear to nucleon cross sections, cannot exceed one;\\ - the larger is a radius of a hadron, the stronger it attenuates in a nucleus;\\ - the higher is the energy of hadrons participating in a hard reaction, the less is the nuclear attenuation;\\ - due to CT hard processes provide a better opportunity to study Fermi-momentum distribution, than soft reactions; etc. (Talk presented at XXVIII Rencontres de Moriond, March 1993) "
"Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Let $H:k^2\to k^2$ be a polynomial mapping such that the Jacobian $\text{Jac}\,H$ is a non-zero constant. In this note we prove, that if there is a line $l \subset k^2$ such that $H|_l:l\to k^2$ is an injection, then $H$ is a polynomial automorphism. "
We sketch two rigorous proofs of the stability of the hydrogen molecule in quantum mechanics. The first one is based on an extrapolation of variational estimates of the groundstate energy of a positronium molecule to arbitrary mass ratios. The second one is an extension of Heitler-London theory to nuclei of finite mass. 
"(The systematics of photon absorption cross sections in nuclei and small metal particles are examined as a function of the number of constituent fermions $A$. It is pointed out that the shell-structure-linked oscillations in the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the photoneutron cross section in nuclei, earlier recognized for $A > 63$, in fact persist down to the lightest nuclei. Averaging over the oscillations or focusing on the lower envelope of the oscillating curve (magic nuclei), the FWHM is seen to generally decrease with increasing $A$, consistent with $A^{-1/3}$, a dependence which was earlier known to hold in metal particle systems. If the FWHMs are scaled by the respective Fermi energies and the inverse radii by the Fermi wave vectors, the two data sets become comparable in magnitude. A schematic theoretical description of the systematics is presented.) "
"Long slit spectra of the region around the Luminous Blue Variable AG Car obtained in June 1990, just before the onset of its new brightening phase, indicate that AG Car was in the hottest phase so far recorded. The spectrum shows strong broad emissions of He II 468.6 nm, and [Fe III] 465.8-470.1 nm, and He I, N II, Si III, Al III and Fe III with a P Cygni profile. We have also identified weak lines of C II and O II. A faint continuum emission has been detected within the whole ring nebula. We also find that the spectrum of some regions is partially due to scattered star's light. This provides evidence of the presence of dust grains, and indicates that even in present times dust is condensing from AG Car wind. The sharp outer edge of the ring suggest the presence of a shock front. We have also identified an extended low density H II $halo$, which should be associated with the residual of the stellar wind of a previous cooler evolutionary phase of AG Car. In the halo the H$\alpha$/[N II] ratio is strengthened with respect to the ring nebula, possibly because of a discontinuity in the N abundance. We suggest that part of the star's reddening originates in the ring nebula and diffuse halo, which could alter the present estimates of the star's distance. The extracted spectrograms are available as computer files on request to rossi@astrom.astro.it. Article in press in A\&A. "
"We analyse the spectral problem for the q-Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for $U_q(\widehat{sl_2}) (0 < q \leq 1)$ at level zero. The case of 2-point functions in the fundamental representation is studied in detail. The scattering states are found explicitly in terms of continuous q-Jacobi polynomials. The corresponding S-matrix is shown to coincide, up to a trivial factor, with the kink-antikink S-matrix in the spin-1/2 XXZ antiferromagnet. "
"It is shown that the finite dimensional irreducible representaions of the quantum matrix algebra $ M_{ q,p}(2) $ ( the coordinate ring of $ GL_{q,p}(2) $) exist only when both q and p are roots of unity. In this case th e space of states has either the topology of a torus or a cylinder which may be thought of as generalizations of cyclic representations. "
"Patterns in reaction-diffusion systems often contain two spatial scales; a long scale determined by a typical wavelength or domain size, and a short scale pertaining to front structures separating different domains. Such patterns naturally develop in bistable and excitable systems, but may also appear far beyond Hopf and Turing bifurcations. The global behavior of domain patterns strongly depends on the fronts' inner structures. In this paper we study a symmetry breaking front bifurcation expected to occur in a wide class of reaction-diffusion systems, and the effects it has on pattern formation and pattern dynamics. We extend previous works on this type of front bifurcation and clarify the relations among them. We show that the appearance of front multiplicity beyond the bifurcation point allows the formation of persistent patterns rather than transient ones. In a different parameter regime, we find that the front bifurcation outlines a transition from oscillating (or breathing) patterns to traveling ones. Near a boundary we find that fronts beyond the bifurcation can reflect, while those below it either bind to the boundary or disappear. "
We show that the Kaehler structure can be naturally incorporated in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. The phase space of the BV formalism becomes a fermionic Kaehler manifold. By introducing an isometry we explicitly construct the fermionic irreducible hermitian symmetric space. We then give some solutions of the master equation in the BV formalism. 
We give a simplified approach to the Abhyankar--Moh theory of approximate roots. Our considerations are based on properties of the intersection multiplicity of local curves. 
"We discuss some recent work in the field of classical solitonic solutions in string theory. In particular, we construct instanton and monopole solutions and discuss the dynamics of string-like solitons. Some of the motivation behind this work is that instantons may provide a nonperturbative understanding of the vacuum structure of string theory, while monopoles may appear in string predictions for grand unification. The string-like solitons represent extended states of fundamental strings. The essential role of supersymmetry in both the saturation of the Bogomol'nyi bound and in the cancellation of higher order corrections is emphasized. (Talk given at the International Workshop: ``Recent Advances in the Superworld'', Houston Advanced Research Center, The Woodlands, TX, April 14-16, 1993.) "
We give an estimate of the growth of a polynonial mapping of $C^n$. 
We study the resonant tunneling of quasiparticles through an impurity between the edges of a Fractional Quantum Hall sample. We show that the one-particle momentum distribution of fractionally charged edge quasiparticles has a quasi-Fermi character. The density of states near the quasi-Fermi energy at zero temperature is singular due to the statistical interaction of quasiparticles. Another effect of this interaction is a new selection rule for the resonant tunneling of fractionally charged quasiparticles: the resonance is suppressed unless an integer number of {\em electrons} occupies the impurity. It allows a new explanation of the scaling behavior observed in the mesoscopic fluctuations of the conductivity in the FQHE. 
We consider the effective $1+1$-dimensional chiral theory describing fluctuations of the order parameter of the Disoriented Chiral Condensate (DCC) which can be formed in the central rapidity region in a relativistic nucleus-nucleus or nucleon-nucleon collisions at high energy. Using $1+1$-dimensional reduction of QCD at high energies and assuming spin polarization of DDC one can find the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) model at level $k=3$ as the effective chiral theory for the one-dimensional DDC. Some possible phenomenological consequences are briefly discussed. 
"We present Lick Observatory slit spectra of 38 objects which were claimed to have pronounced ultraviolet excess and emission lines by Zhan \& Chen. Most of our spectra have FWHM spectral resolutions of about 4~\AA , and relatively high S/N of about 10 -- 50, although some have FWHM $\simeq 15$~\AA ~or lower S/N. We find eleven QSOs, four galaxies at $z \simeq 0.1$, twenty-two stars and one unidentified object with a low S/N spectrum. Six of the QSOs show absorption systems, including Q0000+027A with a relatively strong associated C~IV absorption system, and Q0008+008 (V$\simeq 18.9$) with a damped Ly$\alpha $ system with an H~I column density of $10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. The stars include a wide variety of spectral types. There is one new DA4 white dwarf at 170~pc, one sdB at 14~kpc, and three M stars. The rest are of types F, G and K. We have measured the equivalent widths of the Ca~II~K line, the G-band and the Balmer lines in ten stars with the best spectra, and we derive metallicities. Seven of them are in the range $-2.5 \leq$~[Fe/H]~$\leq -1.7$, while the others are less metal poor. If the stars are dwarfs, then they are at distances of 1 to 7~kpc, but if they are giants, typical distances will be about 10~kpc. "
Gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten theory for compact groups is considered. It is shown that this theory has fermionic BRST-like symmetry and may be exactly solved using localization approach. As an example we calculate functional integral for the case of SU(2) group on the arbitrary Riemann surface. The answer is the particular case of Verlinde formula for the number of conformal blocks. 
"We have found previously unreported observations of the galactic Luminous Blue Variable $\eta ~Car$ covering the period 1860-1865. Contrary to the current belief, these data suggest that the star reached the first magnitude in 1860-1862, with possible large luminosity fluctuations, followed by a steep fading in 1865. A revised historical light curve of this most interesting object is given. Paper in press in Astronomy and Astrophysics. "
"{Although q-oscillators have been used extensively for realization of quantum universal enveloping algebras,such realization do not exist for quantum matrix algebras ( deformation of the algebra of functions on the group ). In this paper we first construct an infinite dimensional representation of the quantum matrix algebra $ M_q ( 3 ) $(the coordinate ring of $ GL_q (3)) $ and then use this representation to realize $ GL_q ( 3 ) $ by q-bosons.} "
"In minimal SUSY-GUT models with $M_{SUSY}\alt 1$ TeV, the renormalization group equations have a solution dominated by the infrared fixed point of the top Yukawa coupling. This fixed point predicts $m_t\simeq (200\; {\rm GeV})\sin \beta $; combined with the LEP results it excludes $m_t\alt 130$ GeV. For $m_t$ in the range 130--160 GeV, it predicts that the lightest scalar $h$ has mass 60--85 GeV (detectable at LEP\,II). At SSC/LHC, each of the five scalars $h$, $H$, $A$, $H^{\pm }$ may be detectable, but not all of them together; in one parameter region none would be detectable. "
In connection with recent publications we discuss spectral sum rules for the Tomonaga-Luttinger model without using the explicit result for the one-electron Green's function. They are usefull in the interpretation of recent high resolution photoemission spectra of quasi-one-dimensional conductors. It is shown that the limit of infinite frequency and band cut\-off do not commute. Our result for arbitrary shape of the interaction potential generalizes an earlier discussion by Suzumura. A general analytical expression for the spectral function for wave vectors far from the Fermi wave vector $k_{F}$ is presented. Numerical spectra are shown to illustrate the sum rules. 
"The critical behavior of charge-density waves (CDWs) in the pinned phase is studied for applied fields increasing toward the threshold field, using recently developed renormalization group techniques and simulations of automaton models. Despite the existence of many metastable states in the pinned state of the CDW, the renormalization group treatment can be used successfully to find the divergences in the polarization and the correlation length, and, to first order in an $\epsilon = 4-d$ expansion, the diverging time scale. The automaton models studied are a charge-density wave model and a ``sandpile'' model with periodic boundary conditions; these models are found to have the same critical behavior, associated with diverging avalanche sizes. The numerical results for the polarization and the diverging length and time scales in dimensions $d=2,3$ are in agreement with the analytical treatment. These results clarify the connections between the behaviour above and below threshold: the characteristic correlation lengths on both sides of the transition diverge with different exponents. The scaling of the distribution of avalanches on the approach to threshold is found to be different for automaton and continuous-variable models. "
"It is shown that the finite dimensional ireducible representations of the quantum matrix algebra $ M_q(3) $ ( the coordinate ring of $ GL_q(3) $ ) exist only when q is a root of unity ( $ q^p = 1 $ ). The dimensions of these representations can only be one of the following values: $ p^3 , { p^3 \over 2 } , { p^3 \over 4 } $ or $ { p^3 \over 8 } $ . The topology of the space of states ranges between two extremes , from a 3-dimensional torus $ S^1 \times S^1 \times S^1 $ ( which may be thought of as a generalization of the cyclic representation ) to a 3-dimensional cube $ [ 0 , 1 ]\times [ 0 , 1 ]\times [ 0 , 1 ] $ . "
"For $N\ge 3$ there are $S_N$ and $D_N$ actions on the space of solutions of the first nontrivial equation in the $SL(N) MKdV hierarchy, generalizing the two $Z_2$ actions on the space of solutions of the standard MKdV equation. These actions survive scaling reduction, and give rise to transformation groups for certain (systems of) ODEs, including the second, fourth and fifth Painlev\'e equations. "
We consider the production and decay of selectrons and charginos in $e^-e^-$ collisions. The advantage over usual $e^+e^-$ collisions is the very low level of standard model backgrounds which should make the discovery of selectrons or charginos relatively straightforward. The use of polarized beams provides an additional powerful tool to determine the supersymmetry parameters. 
"A new approach to the quantization of constrained or otherwise reduced classical mechanical systems is proposed. On the classical side, the generalized symplectic reduction procedure of Mikami and Weinstein, as further extended by Xu in connection with symplectic equivalence bimodules and Morita equivalence of Poisson manifolds, is rewritten so as to avoid the use of symplectic groupoids, whose quantum analogue is unknown. A theorem on symplectic reduction in stages is given. This allows one to discern that the `quantization' of the generalized moment map consists of an operator-valued inner product on a (pre-) Hilbert space (that is, a structure similar to a Hilbert $C^*$-module). Hence Rieffel's far-reaching operator-algebraic generalization of the notion of an induced representation is seen to be the exact quantum counterpart of the classical idea of symplectic reduction, with imprimitivity bimodules and strong Morita equivalence of $C^*$-algebras falling in the right place. Various examples involving groups as well as groupoids are given, and known difficulties with both Dirac and BRST quantization are seen to be absent in our approach. "
"For any polynomial mapping $F=(F_1,\dots ,F_n)$ of $\Cal C^n$ with a finite number of zeros we define the Noether exponent $\nu(F)$. We prove the Jacobi formula for all polynomials of degree strictly less than $\sum_{i=1}^n (\deg F_i-1)-\nu(F)$. "
"Recently a model of chaotic inflation was proposed, where the right handed sneutrinos drive the baryogenesis. We study some of the details of the model, particularly the aspect of CP violation, and determine the number of right handed sneutrinos required for the viability of such models. "
Fractional superstrings in the tensor-product formulation experience ``internal projections'' which reduce their effective central charges. Simple expressions for the characters of the resulting effective worldsheet theory are found. All states in the effective theory can be consistently assigned definite spacetime statistics. The projection to the effective theory is shown to be described by the action of a dimension-three current in the original tensor-product theory. 
"We construct a Left-Right symmetric model in which the number of generation is related to Grassmann variables. We introduce two sets of complex Grassmann variables ($\theta^1_q$,$\theta^2_q$), ($\theta^1_l$, $\theta ^2_l$) and associate each variable with left- and right-handed quark and lepton fields, respectively. Expanding quark and lepton fields in powers of the Grassmann variables, we find that there are exactly three generations of quarks and leptons. Integrating out the Grassmann variables, we obtain phenomenologically acceptable fermion mass matrices. "
"We introduce two simple two-dimensional lattice models to study traffic flow in cities. We have found that a few basic elements give rise to the characteristic phase diagram of a first-order phase transition from a freely moving phase to a jammed state, with a critical point. The jammed phase presents new transitions corresponding to structural transformations of the jam. We discuss their relevance in the infinite size limit. "
"For several computational procedures such as finding radicals and Noether normalizations, it is important to choose as sparse as possible a system of parameters in a polynomial ideal or modulo a polynomial ideal. We describe new strategies for these tasks, thus providing solutions to problems (1) and (2) posed in [Eisenbud-Huneke-Vasconcelos 1992]. "
The description of the three-nucleon system in terms of nucleon and $\Delta$ degrees of freedom is extended to allow for explicit pion production (absorption) from single dynamic $\Delta$ de-excitation (excitation) processes. This mechanism yields an energy dependent effective three-body hamiltonean. The Faddeev equations for the trinucleon bound state are solved with a force model that has already been tested in the two-nucleon system above pion-production threshold. The binding energy and other bound state properties are calculated. The contribution to the effective three-nucleon force arising from the pionic degrees of freedom is evaluated. The validity of previous coupled-channel calculations with explicit but stable $\Delta$ isobar components in the wavefunction is studied. 
"In development of the started activity on lattice analogues of $W$-algebras, we define the notion of lattice $W_{\infty}$-algebra, accociated with lattice integrable system with infinite set of fields. Various kinds of reduction to lattice $W_N$-algebras, related to discrete $N$-KdV hierarchies are described. We also discuss the connection of our results with those obtained in the papers of Xiong [13] and Bonora [14]. "
"I review the use of effective lagrangians in describing the physics beyond the standard model, several theoretical and practical aspects are discussed. It is argued that the only situations where new physics can be observed corresponds to cases where the standard model cntributions are extremely suppressed and where high quality data is avaliable. "
"We propose $N=2$ holomorphic Yang-Mills theory on compact K\""{a}hler manifolds and show that there exists a simple mapping from the $N=2$ topological Yang-Mills theory. It follows that intersection parings on the moduli space of Einstein-Hermitian connections can be determined by examining the small coupling behavior of the $N=2$ holomorphic Yang-Mills theory. This paper is a higher dimensional generalization of the Witten's work on physical Yang-Mills theory in two dimensions. "
"The magnetic moments of the baryon decuplet are calculated in a relativistic constituent quark model using the light-front formalism. Of particular interest are the magnetic moments of the $\Omega^-$ and $\Delta^{++}$ for which new recent experimental measurements are available. Our calculation for the magnetic moment ratio $\mu(\Delta^{++})/\mu(p)$ is in excellent agreement with the experimental ratio, while our ratio $\mu(\Omega^-)/\mu(\Lambda^0)$ is slightly higher than the experimental ratio. "
"To further improve the performance of Monte Carlo simulations of first-order phase transitions we propose to combine the multicanonical approach with multigrid techniques. We report tests of this proposition for the $d$-dimensional $\Phi^4$ field theory in two different situations. First, we study quantum tunneling for $d = 1$ in the continuum limit, and second, we investigate first-order phase transitions for $d = 2$ in the infinite volume limit. Compared with standard multicanonical simulations we obtain improvement factors of several resp. of about one order of magnitude. "
"Employing a cranking Hamiltonian, in the static path approximation to the partition function, we have studied the behaviour of the moment of inertia of $^{64}Zn$ at a few values of temperatures as a function of the rotation frequency. At a low temperature T = 0.5 MeV and J=16 rotational alignment of $0g_{9/2}$ orbitals takes place. But at a high temperature T = 2.0 MeV about 40 - 45$\%$ of all the angular momenta are generated by the alignment of the same orbitals. This should imply a decrease in collectivity for all the spins at high temperatures. "
We show that two-dimensional SO(N) and Sp(N) Yang-Mills theories without fermions can be interpreted as closed string theories. The terms in the 1/N expansion of the partition function on an orientable or nonorientable manifold M can be associated with maps from a string worldsheet onto M. These maps are unbranched and branched covers of M with an arbitrary number of infinitesimal worldsheet cross-caps mapped to points in M. These string theories differ from SU(N) Yang-Mills string theory in that they involve odd powers of 1/N and require both orientable and nonorientable worldsheets. 
"Recent experiments have shown that a quantized Hall plateau can occur in double layer systems at total filling factor v=1/2, though there is no plateau at v=1/2 in a normal single layer system. For the single layer system, considerable insight has been provided by a theory based on the fermion Chern-Simons picture, where the electrons are transformed into fermions that carry two flux quanta of a Chern-Simons gauge field. A similar picture can be used to characterize ground states which have been proposed for the two layer system. "
We study the behaviour of the topological fundamental group under totally ramified abelian covers (a special case of abelian Galois covers) of complex projective varieties of dimension at least 2. 
"We study the phase diagram of non compact $QED_3$ using the microcanonical fermionic average method described elsewhere. We present evidence for a continuous phase transition line in the $\beta, N$ plane, extending down to arbitrarily small flavour number $N$. "
"We discuss the existence of Gribov ambiguities in $SU(m)\times U(1)$ gauge theories over the $n-$spheres. We achieve our goal by showing that there is exactly one conjugacy class of groups of gauge transformations for the theories given above. This implies that these transformation groups are conjugate to the ones of the trivial $SU(m)\times U(1)$ fiber bundles over the $n-$spheres. By using properties of the space of maps $Map_{\ast}(S^n,G)$ where $G$ is one of $U(1)$, $SU(m)$ we are able to determine the homotopy type of the groups of gauge transformations in terms of the homotopy groups of $G$. The non-triviality of these homotopy groups gives the desired result. "
"Two of the important unresolved issues concerning fractional superstrings have been the appearance of new massive sectors whose spacetime statistics properties are unclear, and the appearance of new types of ``internal projections'' which alter or deform the worldsheet conformal field theory in a highly non-trivial manner. In this paper we provide a systematic analysis of these two connected issues, and explicitly map out the effective post-projection worldsheet theories for each of the fractional-superstring sectors. In this way we determine their central charges, highest weights, fusion rules, and characters, and find that these theories are isomorphic to those of free worldsheet bosons and fermions. We also analyze the recently-discovered parafermionic ``twist current'' which has been shown to play an important role in reorganizing the fractional-superstring Fock space, and find that this current can be expressed directly in terms of the primary fields of the post-projection theory. This thereby enables us to deduce some of the spacetime statistics properties of the surviving states. "
"We treat here the interrelation between formal languages and those dynamical systems that can be described by cellular automata (CA). There is a well-known injective map which identifies any CA-invariant subshift with a central formal language. However, in the special case of a symbolic dynamics, i.e. where the CA is just the shift map, one gets a stronger result: the identification map can be extended to a functor between the categories of symbolic dynamics and formal languages. This functor additionally maps topological conjugacies between subshifts to empty-string-limited generalized sequential machines between languages. If the periodic points form a dense set, a case which arises in a commonly used notion of chaotic dynamics, then an even more natural map to assign a formal language to a subshift is offered. This map extends to a functor, too. The Chomsky hierarchy measuring the complexity of formal languages can be transferred via either of these functors from formal languages to symbolic dynamics and proves to be a conjugacy invariant there. In this way it acquires a dynamical meaning. After reviewing some results of the complexity of CA-invariant subshifts, special attention is given to a new kind of invariant subshift: the trapped set, which originates from the theory of chaotic scattering and for which one can study complexity transitions. "
"The role of monopoles in the confining behavior of compact lattice $QED_3$ is studied using an adiabatic cooling method. Monopole-antimonopole pairs with large separation suvive cooling and the presence or absence of such plasma monopoles provides a useful classification of the lattice gauge field configurations at large $\beta$. By calculating observables in subsets of gauge field configurations which contain or do not contain plasma monopoles it is seen that, in compact $QED_3$, monopoles dominate the long distance physics, e.g., the string tension, linear confining potential and dynamical mass generation. On the other hand, the spin-spin interaction is essentially unaffected by monopoles. "
We show that the Heavy Quark Effective Theory is renormalizable perturbatively. We also show that there exist renormalization schemes in which the infinite quark mass limit of any QCD Green function is exactly given by the corresponding Green function of the Heavy Quark Effective Theory. All this is accomplished while preserving BRS invariance. 
The refrerences are corrected. 
"Concepts from elementary quantum mechanics can be used to understand vortex line fluctuations in high-temperature superconductors. Flux lines are essentially classical objects, described by a string tension, their mutual repulsion, and interactions with pinning centers. The classical partition function, however, is isomorphic to the imaginary time path integral description of quantum mechanics. This observation is used to determine the thermal renormalization of critical currents, the decoupling field, the flux lattice melting temperature at low and moderate inductions, and to estimate the degree of entanglement in dense flux liquids. The consequences of the ``polymer glass'' freezing scenario, which assumes that the kinetic constraints of entanglement prevent field cooled flux liquids from crystallizing, are reviewed. "
"Assuming that there exist operators which form an irreducible representation of the q-superoscillator algebra, it is proved that any two such representations are equivalent, related by a uniquely determined superunitary transformation. This provides with a q-supersymmetric generalization of the well-known uniqueness theorem of von Neumann for any finite number of degrees of freedom. "
The quasipotential in the fourth order of perturbation theory is calculated in the Coulomb gauge for the unequal mass particles. It could be used for the future calculations of energy spectra in two-body systems. 
"We discuss the low-energy effective string theory when moduli of the compactified manifold are present. Assuming a nontrivial coupling of the moduli to the Maxwell tensor, we find a class of regular black hole solutions. Both the thermodynamical and the geometrical structure of these solutions are discussed "
"We analyze the ultraviolet (UV) emission line and continuum properties of five low-redshift active galactic nuclei (four luminous quasars: PKS~0405$-$123, H1821+643, PG~0953+414, and 3C273, and one bright Seyfert 1 galaxy: Mrk~205). The HST spectra have higher signal-to-noise ratios (typically $\sim 60$ per resolution element) and spectral resolution ($R = 1300$) than all previously- published UV spectra used to study the emission characteristics of active galactic nuclei. We include in the analysis ground-based optical spectra covering \hb\ and the narrow [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 doublet. The following new results are obtained: \lyb/\lya=0.03$-$0.12 for the four quasars, which is the first accurate measurement of the long-predicted \lyb\ intensity in QSOs. The cores of \lya\ and C~IV are symmetric to an accuracy of better than 2.5% within about 2000 km s$^{-1}$ of the line peak. This high degree of symmetry of \lya\ argues against models in which the broad line cloud velocity field has a significant radial component. The observed smoothness of the \lya\ and C~IV line profiles requires at least $\sim 10^4$ individual clouds if bulk velocity is the only line-broadening mechanism. The overall similarity of the \lya\ and C IV $\lambda$1549 profiles rules out models for the broad line region (BLR) with a radial distribution of virialized.... "
The canonical theory of $N=1$ supergravity is applied to Bianchi class A spatially homogeneous cosmologies. The full set of quantum constraints are then solved with the possible ordering ambiguity taken into account by introducing a free parameter. The wave functions are explicitly given for all the Bianchi class A models in a unified way. Some comments are made on the Bianchi type IX cases.

"We formulate the basic properties of q-vertex operators in the context of the Andrews-Baxter-Forrester (ABF) series, as an example of face-interaction models, derive the q-difference equations satisfied by their correlation functions, and establish their connection with representation theory. We also discuss the q-difference equations of the Kashiwara-Miwa (KM) series, as an example of edge-interaction models. Next, the Ising model--the simplest special case of both ABF and KM series--is studied in more detail using the Jordan-Wigner fermions. In particular, all matrix elements of vertex operators are calculated. "
"We studied the high energy quark anti-quark elastic scattering with an exchange of a mesonic state in the $t$ channel with $-t/\Lambda_{QCD}^{2} \gg 1$. Two methods are proposed to eliminate the strong background from bare pomeron, reggized gluon and odderon exchange. The feasibility of measuring mesonic reggeon exchange is discussed. "
We study the Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation for both open and closed string field theory with special attention to anomalies. Open string field theory is anomaly free once the minimal coupling to closed strings induced by loop amplitudes is considered. In closed string field theory the full-fledged master equation has to be solved order by order in perturbation theory. The existence of a solution implies the absence of anomaly. We briefly discuss the relation of the iterative process of solution to methods used in the first quantized formalism and comment on some possible non-perturbative corrections. 
"The quantization of a free boson whose momentum satisfies a cubic constraint leads to a $c=\ha$ conformal field theory with a BRST symmetry. The theory also has a $W_\infty $ symmetry in which all the generators except the stress-tensor are BRST-exact and so topological. The BRST cohomology includes states of conformal dimensions $0,\si,\ha$, together with \lq copies' of these states obtained by acting with picture-changing and screening operators. The 3-point and 4-point correlation functions agree with those of the Ising model, suggesting that the theory is equivalent to the critical Ising model. At tree level, the $W_3$ string can be viewed as an ordinary $c=26$ string whose conformal matter sector includes this realisation of the Ising model. The two-boson $W_3$ string is equivalent to the Ising model coupled to two-dimensional quantum gravity. Similar results apply for other W-strings and minimal models. "
"This paper summarizes a talk presented at the April NATO ASI on Spatiotemporal Chaos in Complex Fluids, in Santa Fe, NM. The paper gives reasons that make complex fluids good material systems for conducting experiments on pattern formation and other nonequilibrium phenomena. Much of the discussion focuses on the different phenomena observed in solidification and how the increasing complexity of fluid systems decreases the velocity scale for achieving ""rapid"" solidification. Five systems are compared to illustrate this point: simple fluids, simple alloys, thermotropic liquid crystals, lyotropic liquid crystals, and diblock copolymers. Finally, an example is given of the kinds of transitions that may be observed in rapid solidification. "
"We re-examine the justification for the imposition of regular boundary conditions on the wavefunction at the Coulomb singularity in the treatment of the hydrogen atom in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We show that the issue of the correct boundary conditions is not independent of the physical structure of the proton. Under the physically reasonable assumption that the finite size and structure of the proton can be represented as a positive correction to the Coulomb potential, we give a justification for the regular boundary condition, which, in contrast to the usual treatments, is physically motivated and mathematically rigorous. We also describe how irregular boundary conditions can be used to model non-positive corrections to the Coulomb potential. "
"The interconnection between self-duality, conformal invariance and Lie-Poisson structure of the two dimensional non-abelian Thirring model is investigated in the framework of the hamiltonian method. "
"We present a new application of affine Lie algebras to massive quantum field theory in 2 dimensions, by investigating the $q\to 1$ limit of the q-deformed affine $\hat{sl(2)}$ symmetry of the sine-Gordon theory, this limit occuring at the free fermion point. We describe how radial quantization leads to a quasi-chiral factorization of the space of fields. The conserved charges which generate the affine Lie algebra split into two independent affine algebras on this factorized space, each with level 1 in the anti-periodic sector. The space of fields in the anti-periodic sector can be organized using level-$1$ highest weight representations, if one supplements the $\slh$ algebra with the usual local integrals of motion. Using the integrals of motion, a momentum space bosonization involving vertex operators is formulated. This leads to a new way of computing form-factors, as vacuum expectation values in momentum space. "
An explicit derivation of the elements of the representation ring of SU(2) needed to implement the four-dimensional Kirby calculus is sketched. 
"The appearance of terms, which are analogous to ones required for symmetry breaking, in Lagrangian of Ref. [1] is shown to be caused by gauge invariance of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and by inaccuracy of the cited author in the choice of canonical variables. These terms do not have physical significance within modern quantum electrodynamics. PACS: 03.50.De, 04.20.Cv, 04.20.Fy, 11.10.Ef. "
"Replaced with revised (uncorrupted) version We present a general scheme for generating (2,2) symmetric fermionic string models and classify the models in D=8 and D=6 space time dimensions. We discuss the relationship to other compactification schemes. "
"The basic ideas and power counting rules of chiral perturbation theory are discussed. The formalism of velocity dependent fields for baryons, and for hadrons containing a heavy quark, is explained. (Invited Talk, 1993 QCD Rencontres de Moriond) "
"We study rapidity-gap events in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at the Z boson peak initiated by the emission of a virtual photon. This mechanism is suppressed by the QED coupling constant, but it is enhanced due to a large propagator term from the virtual photon. For typical kinematics, we find a smaller event rate than analogous QCD type gap events. In the small jet-pair invariant mass limit, the QED type events follow a $1+\cos^2\theta$ distribution in the jet-pair scattering angle, instead of the $\sin^2\theta$ distribution of the QCD case. "
"The totality of all Zakharov-Shabat equations (ZS), i.e., zero-curvature equations with rational dependence on a spectral parameter, if properly defined, can be considered as a hierarchy. The latter means a collection of commuting vector fields in the same phase space. Further properties of the hierarchy are discussed, such as additional symmetries, an analogue to the string equation, a Grassmannian related to the ZS hierarchy, and a Grassmannian definition of soliton solutions. "
"We have shown an example of semiclassical transition in $\phi^{4}$ theory with positive coupling constant. This process can be described by the classical $O(4)$-invariant solution, considered on a contour in the complex time plane. The transition is technically analogous to the one-instanton transition in the electroweak model. It is suppressed by the factor $\exp(-2S_{0})$, where $S_{0}$ is Lipatov instanton action. This process describes a semiclassical transition between two coherent states with much smaller number of particles in the initial state than in the final state. Therefore, it could be relevant to the problem of calculation of amplitudes for multiparticle production in $\phi^4$-type models. "
We construct a model of gravity in 1+1 spacetime dimensions in which the solutions approach the Schwarzschild metric at large $r$ and de Sitter space far inside the horizon. Our model may be viewed as a two dimensional application of the `Limiting Curvature Construction' recently proposed by two of the authors. 
"Although delta Scorpii is a bright and well-studied star, the details of its multiplicity have remained unclear. Here we present the first diffraction-limited image of this 0.12 arcsec binary star, made using optical interferometry, and resolve the confusion that has existed in the literature over its multiplicity. Examining published speckle measurements, together with the present result, reveals a periodicity of 10.5 yr and allows calculation of the orbital parameters. The orbit has a high eccentricity (e=0.82) and large inclination (i=70 degrees), making it a favourable target for radial velocity measurements during the next periastron (in 2000). "
"Focus of these lectures is the challenge of explaining the origin of structure in the Universe. The interplay between quantum field theory and classical general relativity has given rise to several interesting cosmological models which contain mechanisms for generating density inhomogeneities. The three theories discussed here are the inflationary Universe, the cosmic string and the global texture models. The recent COBE discovery of anisotropies in the microwave background has provided some support for all three models. The present results do not allow a distinction between these models. Statistics which distinguish between the predictions of the three theories are discussed. "
Static spherically symmetric asymptotically flat charged black hole solutions are constructed within the magnetic SU(3) sector of the 4-dimensional heterotic string effective action. They possess non-abelian hair in addition to the Coulomb magnetic field and are qualitatively similar to the Einstein-Yang-Mills colored SU(3) black holes except for the extremal case. In the extremality limit the horizon shrinks and the resulting geometry around the origin coincides with that of an extremal abelian dilatonic black hole with magnetic charge. Non-abelian hair exibits then typical sphaleron structure. 
"We present a ``natural finitization'' of the fermionic q-series (certain generalizations of the Rogers-Ramanujan sums) which were recently conjectured to be equal to Virasoro characters of the unitary minimal conformal field theory (CFT) M(p,p+1). Within the quasi-particle interpretation of the fermionic q-series this finitization amounts to introducing an ultraviolet cutoff, which -- contrary to a lattice spacing -- does not modify the linear dispersion relation. The resulting polynomials are conjectured (proven, for p=3,4) to be equal to corner transfer matrix (CTM) sums which arise in the computation of order parameters in regime III of the r=p+1 RSOS model of Andrews, Baxter, and Forrester. Following Schur's proof of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities, these authors have shown that the infinite-lattice limit of the CTM sums gives what later became known as the Rocha-Caridi formula for the Virasoro characters. Thus we provide a proof of the fermionic q-series representation for the Virasoro characters for p=4 (the case p=3 is ``trivial''), in addition to extending the remarkable connection between CFT and off-critical RSOS models. We also discuss finitizations of the CFT modular-invariant partition functions. "
"If the Universe has the topology of a 3-torus ($T^3$), then it follows from recent data on large-scale temperature fluctuations $\Delta T/T$ of the cosmic microwave background that either the minimal size of the torus is at least of the order of the present cosmological horizon, or the large-scale $\Delta T/T$ pattern should have a symmetry plane (in case of the effective $T^1$ topology) or a symmetry axis (in case of the effective $T^2$ topology), the latter possibility being probably excluded by the data. "
"All three-manifolds are known to occur as Cauchy surfaces of asymptotically flat vacuum spacetimes and of spacetimes with positive-energy sources. We prove here the conjecture that general relativity does not allow an observer to probe the topology of spacetime: any topological structure collapses too quickly to allow light to traverse it. More precisely, in a globally hyperbolic, asymptotically flat spacetime satisfying the null energy condition, every causal curve from $\scri^-$ to ${\scri}^+$ is homotopic to a topologically trivial curve from $\scri^-$ to ${\scri}^+$. (If the Poincar\'e conjecture is false, the theorem does not prevent one from probing fake 3-spheres). "
New additional equations for the Newtonian dynamical systems on Riemannian manifolds are found. They supplement the previously found weak normality conditions up to the complete normality conditions for Newtonian dynamical systems. 
"The exact free energy of SU($N$) Chern-Simons theory at level $k$ is expanded in powers of $(N+k)^{-2}.$ This expansion keeps rank-level duality manifest, and simplifies as $k$ becomes large, keeping $N$ fixed (or vice versa)---this is the weak-coupling (strong-coupling) limit. With the standard normalization, the free energy on the three-sphere in this limit is shown to be the generating function of the Euler characteristics of the moduli spaces of surfaces of genus $g,$ providing a string interpretation for the perturbative expansion. A similar expansion is found for the three-torus, with differences that shed light on contributions from different spacetime topologies in string theory. "
"The properties of the canonical symmetry of the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation are investigated. The densities of the local conservation laws for this system are shown to change under the action of the canonical symmetry by total space derivatives. "
"We do not yet know how to quantize gravity in 3+1 dimensions, but in lower dimensions we face the opposite problem: many of the approaches originally developed for (3+1)-dimensional gravity can be successfully implemented in 2+1 dimensions, but the resulting quantum theories are not all equivalent. In this talk, I discuss six such approaches --- reduced phase space ADM quantization, the Chern-Simons/connection representation, covariant canonical quantization, the loop representation, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, and lattice methods --- for the simple case of a spacetime whose spatial topology is that of a torus. A comparison of the resulting quantum theories can provide some useful insights into the conceptual issues that underlie quantum gravity in any number of dimensions. (Talk given at the Fifth Canadian Conference on General Relativity and Relativistic Astrophysics, Waterloo, Ontario, May 1993) "
"We show that, in string theory, as a result of the $W_{\infty}$-symmetries that preserve quantum coherence in the {\it full} string theory by coupling different mass levels, transitions between initial- and final-state density matrices for the effective light-particle theory involve non-Hamiltonian terms $\nd{\delta H}$ in their time evolution, and are described by a $\nd{S}$ matrix that is not factorizable as a product of field-theoretical $S$ and $S^\dagger$ matrices. We exhibit non-trivial string contributions to $\nd{\delta H}$ and the $\nd{S}$ matrix associated with topological fluctuations related to the coset model that describes an s-wave black hole. These include monopole-antimonopole configurations on the world-sheet that correspond to black hole creation and annihilation, and instantons that represent back-reaction via quantum jumps between black holes of different mass, both of which make the string supercritical. The resulting Liouville mode is interpreted as the time variable, and the arrow of time is associated with black hole decay. Since conformal invariance is broken in the non-critical string theory, monopole and antimonopole, or instanton and anti-instanton, are not separable, and the "
"One of the paradoxes associated with the theory of the formation and subsequent Hawking evaporation of a black hole is the disappearance of conserved global charges. It has long been known that metric fluctuations at short distances (wormholes) violate global-charge conservation; if global charges are apparently conserved at ordinary energies, it is only because wormhole-induced global-charge-violating terms in the low-energy effective Lagrangian are suppressed by large mass denominators. However, such suppressed interactions can become important at the high energy densities inside a collapsing star. We analyze this effect for a simple model of the black-hole singularity. (Our analysis is totally independent of any detailed theory of wormhole dynamics; in particular it does not depend on the wormhole theory of the vanishing of the cosmological constant.) We find that in general all charge is extinguished before the infalling matter crosses the singularity. No global charge appears in the outgoing Hawking radiation because it has all gone down the wormholes. "
"The one-plaquette Hamiltonian of large N lattice gauge theory offers a constructive model of a $1+1$-dimensional string theory with a stable ground state. The free energy is found to be equivalent to the partition function of a string where the world sheet is discretized by even polygons with signature and the link factor is given by a non-Gaussian propagator. At large, but finite, N we derive the nonperturbative density of states from the WKB wave function and the dispersion relations. This is expressible as an infinite, but convergent, series with the inverse of the hypergeometric function replacing the harmonic oscillator spectrum of the $1+1$-dimensional string. In the scaling limit, the series is shown to be finite, containing both the perturbative (asymptotic) expansion of the inverted harmonic oscillator model, and a nonperturbative piece that survives the scaling limit. "
"We present a set of quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians which can be written as the $F^{\,\rm th}$ power of a conserved charge: $H=Q^F$ with $[H,Q]=0$ and $F=2,3,...\, .$ This new construction, which we call {\it fractional}\/ supersymmetric quantum mechanics, is realized in terms of \pg\ variables satisfying $\t^F=0$. Furthermore, in a pseudo-classical context, we describe {\it fractional}\/ supersymmetry transformations as the $F^{\,\rm th}$ roots of time translations, and provide an action invariant under such transformations. "
"The use of MS-like renormalization schemes in QCD requires an implementation of nontrivial matching conditions across thresholds, a fact often overlooked in the literature. We shortly review the use of these matching conditions in QCD and check explicitly that the prediction for $\alpha_s(M_Z)$, obtained by running the strong coupling constant from the $M_\tau$ scale, does not substantially depend on the exact value of the matching point chosen in crossing the $b$-quark threshold when the appropriate matching conditions are taken into account. "
"We are discussing some aspects of the magnetic monopoles and cosmic strings interactions with axion domain walss and membranes. The monopole moving through an axion domain wall is transformed into a monopole bag - the state with a dyon quantum number, but smaller mass. In the case of an axion membrane the passing monopole excites the chiral charged state at the membrane boundary. It will be shown that if cosmic string intersects an axion domain wall there will be $\theta = \pi$, i.e. maximal $CP$-violation inside the string. Strings carrying the flux of the $Z$-boson field become the sources of the baryon charge nonconservation. The symbiosis of the two pictures - monopole passing through an axion domain wall and string intersecting it - is the case of the interaction between an axion domain wall and a Nambu electroweak string carrying $SU(2)_{L}$ monopoles at the ends. "
"We calculate, in the framework of QCD sum rules and to next-to-leading order in perturbation theory, the universal function $\xi_3(v\cdot v')$ which appears at order $1/m_Q$ in the heavy quark expansion of meson weak decay form factors. We find that radiative corrections of order $\alpha_s$ are very important. Over the kinematic range accessible in semileptonic decays, $\xi_3(v\cdot v')$ is proportional to the leading-order Isgur-Wise function $\xi(v\cdot v')$ to very good accuracy. Taking into account all sources of uncertainty, we estimate $\xi_3/\xi=(0.6\pm 0.2)$. This reduces the theoretical uncertainty in the extraction of $|\,V_{cb}|$ from $\bar B\to D\,\ell\, \bar\nu$ transitions. A measurement of the form factor ratio $A_2/A_1$ in $\bar B\to D^*\ell\,\bar\nu$ decays can be used to test our prediction. "
"The Anderson impurity model for finite values of the Coulomb repulsion $U$ is studied using a slave boson representation for the empty and doubly occupied $f$-level. In order to avoid well known problems with a naive mean field theory for the boson fields, we use the coherent state path integral representation to first integrate out the double occupancy slave bosons. The resulting effective action is linearized using {\bf two-time} auxiliary fields. After integration over the fermionic degrees of freedom one obtains an effective action suitable for a $1/N_f$-expansion. Concerning the constraint the same problem remains as in the infinite $U$ case. For $T \rightarrow 0$ and $N_f \rightarrow \infty$ exact results for the ground state properties are recovered in the saddle point approximation. Numerical solutions of the saddle point equations show that even in the spindegenerate case $N_f = 2$ the results are quite good. "
We show how the transverse polarization of a quark initiating a jet can be probed by the azimuthal distribution of two hadrons (of large $z$) in the jet. This permits a twist 2 asymmetry in hard processes when only one of the initial particles is polarized transversely. Applications to hadron-hadron and lepton-hadron scattering are discussed. 
"We analyze the sensitivity of a network of interferometer gravitational-wave detectors to the gravitational-wave stochastic background, and derive the dependence of this sensitivity on the orientations of the detector arms. We build on and extend the recent work of Christensen, but our conclusion for the optimal choice of orientations of a pair of detectors differs from his. For a pair of detectors (such as LIGO) that subtends an angle at the center of the earth of $\,\alt 70^\circ$, we find that the optimal configuration is for each detector to have its arms make an angle of $45^\circ$ (modulo $90^\circ$) with the arc of the great circle that joins them. For detectors that are farther separated, each detector should instead have one arm aligned with this arc. We also describe in detail the optimal data-analysis algorithm for searching for the stochastic background with a detector network, which is implicit in earlier work of Michelson. The LIGO pair of detectors will be separated by $\sim 3000 \, {\rm km}$. The minimum detectable stochastic energy-density for these detectors with their currently planned orientations is $\sim 3\%$ greater than what it would be if the orientations were optimal. "
"We exhibit string contributions to the $\nd{S}$ matrix relating in- and out- state density matrices that do not factorize as a product of $S$ and $S^\dagger$ matrices. They are associated with valley trajectories between topological defects on the string world sheet, that appear as quantum fluctuations in the space-time foam. Through their ultraviolet cut-off dependences these valleys cause non-Hamiltonian time evolution and suppress off-diagonal entries in the density matrix at large times. "
"Coherent states path integral formalism for the simplest quantum algebras, q-oscillator, SU_q(2) and SU_q(1,1) is introduced. In the classical limit canonical structure is derived with modified symplectic and Riemannian metric. Non-constant deformation induced curvature for the phase spaces is obtained. "
"We examine the evaporation of two--dimensional black holes, the classical space--times of which are extended geometries, like for example the two--dimensional section of the extremal Reissner--Nordstrom black hole. We find that the evaporation in two particular models proceeds to a stable end--point. This should represent the generic behavior of a certain class of two--dimensional dilaton--gravity models. There are two distinct regimes depending on whether the back--reaction is weak or strong in a certain sense. When the back--reaction is weak, evaporation proceeds via an adiabatic evolution, whereas for strong back--reaction, the decay proceeds in a somewhat surprising manner. Although information loss is inevitable in these models at the semi--classical level, it is rather benign, in that the information is stored in another asymptotic region. "
"The equations determining the energy density $\rho$ of a gas of photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with a spherical mass $M$ at a non-zero temperature $T_s>0$ is derived from Einstein's equations. It is found that for large $r$, $\rho \sim 1/r^2$ where the proportionality constant is a {\it fundamental constant\/} and is the same for all spherical masses at all temperatures. "
"Whether spin-independent Coulomb interaction can be the origin of a realistic ferromagnetism in an itinerant electron system has been an open problem for a long time. Here we study a class of Hubbard models on decorated lattices, which have a special property that the corresponding single-electron Schr\""{o}dinger equation has $N_{\rm d}$-fold degenerate ground states. The degeneracy $N_{\rm d}$ is proportional to the total number of sites $\abs{\Lambda}$. We prove that the ground states of the models exhibit ferromagnetism when the electron filling factor is not more than and sufficiently close to $\rho_0=N_{\rm d}/(2\abs{\Lambda})$, and paramagnetism when the filling factor is sufficiently small. An important feature of the present work is that it provides examples of three dimensional itinerant electron systems which are proved to exhibit ferromagnetism in a finite range of the electron filling factor. "
"We construct bosonized vertex operators (VOs) and conjugate vertex operators (CVOs) of $U_q(su(2)_k)$ for arbitrary level $k$ and representation $j\leq k/2$. Both are obtained directly as two solutions of the defining condition of vertex operators - namely that they intertwine $U_q(su(2)_k)$ modules. We construct the screening charge and present a formula for the n-point function. Specializing to $j=1/2$ we construct all VOs and CVOs explicitly. The existence of the CVO allows us to place the calculation of the two-point function on the same footing as $k=1$; that is, it is obtained without screening currents and involves only a single integral from the CVO. This integral is evaluated and the resulting function is shown to obey the q-KZ equation and to reduce simply to both the expected $k=1$ and $q=1$ limits. "
"A new approach for investigating the classical dynamics of the relativistic string model with rigidity is proposed. It is based on the embedding of the string world surface into the space of a constant curvature. It is shown that the rigid string in flat space-time is described by the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Willmore functional in a space-time of the constant curvature K=-g/(2 a), where g and a are constants in front of the Nambu-Goto term and the curvature term in the rigid string action respectively. For simplicity the Euclidean version of the rigid string in the three-dimensional space-time is considered. The Willmore functional (the action for the ""Willmore string"") is obtained by dropping the Nambu-Goto term in the Polyakov-Kleinert action for the rigid string. Such ""reduction"" of the rigid string model would be useful, for example, by applying some results about the Numbu-Goto string dynamics in the de Sitter universe to the rigid string model in the Minkowski space-time. It allows also to use numerous mathematical results about the Willmore surfaces in the context of the physical problem. "
"The asymptotic form of the energy density for a gas of particles surrounding a sphere of mass $M$ and radius $R$ is studied using Einstein's equations. It is shown that if the pressure of the gas $p$ varies linearly with the energy density $\rho$ for small $\rho$, then $\rho\sim 1/r^2$ for large $r$. "
"We derive different representations of compact QED fixed to Landau gauge by the lattice Faddeev-Popov procedure. Our analysis finds that (A)Nielsen-Olesen vortices arising from the compactness of the gauge-fixing action are {\it quenched\/}, that is, the Faddeev-Popov determinant cancels them out and they do not influence correlation functions such as the photon propagator; (B)Dirac strings are responsible for the nonzero mass pole of the photon propagator. Since in $D=3+1$ the photon mass undergoes a rapid drop to zero at $\beta_c$, the deconfinement point, this result predicts that Dirac strings must be sufficiently dilute at $\beta > \beta_c$. Indeed, numerical simulations reveal that the string density undergoes a rapid drop to near zero at $\beta\sim \beta_c$. "
Quantum de Rham complexes on the quantum plane and the quantum group itself are constructed for the Zakrewski deformation of $ Fun ( SL(2)) $. As a by-product a new deformation of the two dimensional Heisenberg algeb ra is constructed which can be used to construct models of h-deformed quantum mechanics. 
"We investigate the surface width $W$ of solid-on-solid surfaces in the vicinity of the roughening temperature $T_r$. Above $T_r$, $W^2$ is expected to diverge with the system size $L$ like $\ln L$. However, close to $T_r$ a clean $\ln{L}$ behavior can only be seen on extremely large lattices. Starting from the Kosterlitz-Thouless renormalization group, we derive an improved formula that describes the small $L$ behavior on both sides of $T_r$. For the Discrete Gaussian model, we used the valleys-to-mountains-reflections cluster algorithm in order to simulate the fluctuating solid-on-solid surface. The base plane above which the surface is defined is an $L \times L$ square lattice. In the simulation we took $8\leq L\leq 256$. The improved formula fits the numerical results very well. {}From the analysis, we estimate the roughening temperature to be $T_r = 0.755(3)$. "
"We calculate supersymmetric QCD corrections (squark/gluino loops) to quark pair production in e+ e- annihilation, allowing for mixing between left- and right-handed squarks and taking into account the effects of nonzero quark masses. Corrections to the Z boson partial widths are generally small and positive, except in the case of large b-squark mixing, where they become negative. At high-energy e+ e- colliders, larger corrections to the total cross sections are possible. Corrections to forward-backward asymmetries are negligible except possibly for top quarks, where they are sensitive to t-squark mixing. We also comment on the possibility that the gluino mass is only a few GeV. "
"Two-particle annihilation reaction, A+A -> inert, for immobile reactants on the Bethe lattice is solved exactly for the initially random distribution. The process reaches an absorbing state in which no nearest-neighbor reactants are left. The approach of the concentration to the limiting value is exponential. The solution reproduces the known one-dimensional result which is further extended to the reaction A+B -> inert. "
"Recently, we presented a new class of quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians which can be written as the $F^{th}$ power of a conserved charge: $H=Q^F$ with $F=2,3,...\,.$ This construction, called fractional supersymmetric quantum mechanics, was realized in terms of a paragrassmann variable $\theta$ of order $F$, which satisfies $\theta^F=0$. Here, we present an alternative realization of such an algebra in which the internal space of the Hamiltonians is described by a tensor product of two paragrassmann variables of orders $F$ and $F-1$ respectively. In particular, we find $q$-deformed relations (where $q$ are roots of unity) between different conserved charges. (To appear in ""Mod.Phys.Lett.A"") "
"Neutrinos can polarize a medium due to their weak interaction. This can manifest itself as an effective induced charge of the neutrino. We show how it is related to the Debye screening length in a plasma, first using the results of the 1-loop calculation of the neutrino electromagnetic vertex and then in general to all orders in $e$ and to leading order in the Fermi coupling. We also discuss how the results are modified if the neutrinos have mass -- either Dirac or Majorana type. "
"The most general form of a marginal extended perturbation in a two-dimensional system is deduced from scaling considerations. It includes as particular cases extended perturbations decaying either from a surface, a line or a point for which exact results have been previously obtained. The first-order corrections to the local exponents, which are functions of the amplitude of the defect, are deduced from a perturbation expansion of the two-point correlation functions. Assuming covariance under conformal transformation, the perturbed system is mapped onto a cylinder. Working in the Hamiltonian limit, the first-order corrections to the lowest gaps are calculated for the Ising model. The results confirm the validity of the gap-exponent relations for the perturbed system. "
"We discuss the effects of finite sky coverage and the uncertainty in extracting information about the power spectrum from experiments on small angular scales. In general the cosmic variance is enhanced by a factor of $4\pi/A$, where $A$ is the solid angle sampled by the experiment. As a rough guide, an experiment with sensitivity peaking at the $\ell$th multipole has to cover $\simgt\ell$ independent patches to have a lower ``sample variance'' than for a whole-sky measurement of the quadrupole. Our approach gives a relatively simple way of attaching an error bar to the theoretical prediction for a particular experiment, and thereby comparing theories with experimental results, without the need for computationally-intensive Maximum Likelihood or Monte Carlo calculations. "
"Supersymmetric (pseudo-classical) mechanics has recently been generalized to {\it fractional}\/ supersymmetric mechanics. In such a construction, the action is invariant under fractional supersymmetry transformations, which are the $F^{\,\rm th}$ roots of time translations (with $F=1,2,...$). Associated with these symmetries, there are conserved charges with fractional canonical dimension $1+1/F$. Using \pg\ variables satisfying $\t^F=0$, we present a fractional-superspace formulation of this construction. "
"The reconstruction mechanism of (001) fcc transition metal surfaces is investigated using a full-potential all-electron electronic structure method within density-functional theory. Total-energy supercell calculations confirm the experimental finding that a close-packed quasi-hexagonal overlayer reconstruction is possible for the late 5$d$-metals Ir, Pt, and Au, while it is disfavoured in the isovalent 4$d$ metals (Rh, Pd, Ag). The reconstructive behaviour is driven by the tensile surface stress of the unreconstructed surfaces; the stress is significantly larger in the 5$d$ metals than in 4$d$ ones, and only in the former case it overcomes the substrate resistance to the required geometric rearrangement. It is shown that the surface stress for these systems is due to $d$ charge depletion from the surface layer, and that the cause of the 4th-to-5th row stress difference is the importance of relativistic effects in the 5$d$ series. "
"The Dirac equation is solved in the Einstein-Yang-Mills background found by Bartnik and McKinnon. We find a normalizable zero-energy fermion mode in the $s$-wave sector. As shown recently, their solution corresponds to a gravitational sphaleron which mediates transitions between topologically distinct vacua. Since the Bartnik-McKinnon solution is unstable, it will either collapse to form a black hole or radiate away its energy. In either case, as the Chern-Simons number of the configuration changes, there will be an accompanying anomalous change in fermion number. "
"This is intended to be a simple discussion of work done in collaboration with S. Cecotti, K. Intriligator and C. Vafa; and with H. Saleur. I discuss how $ Tr F (-1)^F e^{-\beta H}$ can be computed exactly in any N=2 supersymmetric theory in two dimensions. It gives exact information on the soliton spectrum of the theory, and corresponds to the partition function of a single self-avoiding polymer looped once around a cylinder of radius $\beta$. It is independent of almost all deformations of the theory, and satisfies an exact differential equation as a function of $\beta$. For integrable theories it can also be computed from the exact S-matrix. This implies a highly non-trivial equivalence of a set of coupled integral equations with the classical sinh-Gordon and the affine Toda equations. "
"We re-analyze data on deep inelastic polarized lepton-nucleon scattering, with particular attention to testing the Bjorken sum rule and estimating the quark contributions to the nucleon spin. Since only structure function data at fixed $Q^2$ can be used to test sum rules, we use E142 asymmetry measurements and unpolarized structure function data to extract $g_1^n$ at fixed $Q^2$ = 2 GeV$^2$. When higher-twist effects, which are important at low $Q^2$, are included, both the E142 and SMC data are compatible with the Bjorken sum rule within one standard deviation. Assuming validity of the Bjorken sum rule, we estimate the quark contributions to the nucleon spin, finding that their total net contribution is small, with the strange quark contribution non-zero and negative. The quark spin content of the nucleon spin is in agreement with Skyrme model. "
"In these lecture notes we explain a connection between Yang-Mills theory on arbitrary Riemann surfaces and two types of topological field theory, the so called $BF$ and cohomological theories. The quantum Yang-Mills theory is solved exactly using path integral techniques. Explicit expressions, in terms of group representation theory, are obtained for the partition function and various correlation functions. In a particular limit the Yang-Mills theory devolves to the topological models and the previously determined correlation functions give topological information about the moduli spaces of flat connections. In particular, the partition function yields the volume of the moduli space for which an explicit expression is derived. These notes are self contained, with a basic introduction to the various ideas underlying the topological field theories. This includes some relatively new work on handling problems that arise in the presence of reducible connections which in turn forms the bridge between the various models under consideration. These notes are identical to those made available to participants of the 1992 summer school in Trieste, except for one or two additions added circa January 1993. "
"We survey some recent ideas and progress in looking for particle physics beyond the Standard Model, connected by the theme of Supersymmetry (SUSY). We review the success of SUSY-GUT models, the expected experimental signatures and present limits on SUSY partner particles, and Higgs phenomenology in the minimal SUSY model. "
"Using an anisotropic hybridization matrix element, V($\vec k$), reflecting cubic symmetry at the ``rare-earth'' sites of the infinite U Anderson lattice, we calculate the bare quasiparticle scattering amplitude to order 1/N using slave Bosons and find significant differences with previous results under spherical symmetry. Due to exchange of density fluctuations, we find an instability. toward E$_g$ and T$_{1g}$ (even-parity) pairing. "
"New parameter free calculations including a variety of necessary kinematic and dynamic effects show that the results of BNL $(p,2p)$ measurements are consistent with the expectations of color transparency. "
For generic $q$ we give expressions for the transformations of all essentially typical finite-dimensional modules of the Hopf superalgebra $U_q[gl(3/2)]$. The latter is a deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie superalgebra $gl(3/2)$. The basis within each module is similar to the Gel'fand-Zetlin basis for $gl(5)$. We write down expressions for the transformations of the basis under the action of the Chevalley generators. 
"Lattice Boltzmann methods are numerical schemes derived as a kinetic approximation of an underlying lattice gas. A numerical convergence theory for nonlinear convective-diffusive lattice Boltzmann methods is established. Convergence, consistency, and stability are defined through truncated Hilbert expansions. In this setting it is shown that consistency and stability imply convergence. Monotone lattice Boltzmann methods are defined and shown to be stable, hence convergent when consistent. Examples of diffusive and convective-diffusive lattice Boltzmann methods that are both consistent and monotone are presented. "
"The Green functions of the Chern-Simons theory quantized in the axial gauge are shown to be calculable as the unique, exact solution of the Ward identities which express the invariance of the theory under the topological supersymmetry of Delduc, Gieres and Sorella. "
"We study toroidal compactifications of string theories which include compactification of a timelike coordinate. Some new features in the theory of toroidal compactifications arise. Most notably, Narain moduli space does not exist as a manifold since the action of duality on background data is ergodic. For special compactifications certain infinite dimensional symmetries, analogous to the infinite dimensional symmetries of the $2D$ string are unbroken. We investigate the consequences of these symmetries and search for a universal symmetry which contains all unbroken gauge groups. We define a flat connection on the moduli space of toroidally compactified theories. Parallel transport by this connection leads to a formulation of broken symmetry Ward identities. In an appendix this parallel transport is related to a definition of conformal perturbation theory. "
"This paper analyses the effects of random noise in determining errors and confidence levels for galaxy redshifts obtained by cross-correlation techniques. The main finding is that confidence levels have previously been overestimated, and errors inaccurately calculated in certain applications. New formul\ae\ are presented. "
"The thermal rates for converting neutrons to protons, and vice versa, are calculated, including corrections of order 1 MeV divided by a nucleon mass. The results imply that the primodial helium abundance predicted for big bang nucleosynthesis has been systematically underestimated by about $\delta Y_4 = 0.0012$, i.e., $\delta Y_4 / Y_4 \approx .005$. "
We use the formal Lie algebraic structure in the ``space'' of hamiltonians provided by equal time commutators to define a Kirillov-Konstant symplectic structure in the coadjoint orbits of the associated formal group. The dual is defined via the natural pairing between operators and states in a Hilbert space. 
"We discuss the fragmentation of a heavy quark to a baryon containing two heavy quarks of mass $m_Q\gg\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. In this limit the heavy quarks first combine perturbatively into a compact diquark with a radius small compared to $1/\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$, which interacts with the light hadronic degrees of freedom exactly as does a heavy antiquark. The subsequent evolution of this $QQ$ diquark to a $QQq$ baryon is identical to the fragmentation of a heavy antiquark to a meson. We apply this analysis to the production of baryons of the form $ccq$, $bbq$, and $bcq$. "
"I present an algorithm in the search for symmetric textures in the quark Yukawa matrices. This is based on a talk at the Coral Gables conference in January 1993. I include the macro tables2.tex for making tables, and use the Santa Barbara jnl and reforder macros. "
"The ordinary Poisson brackets in field theory do not fulfil the Jacobi identity if boundary values are not reasonably fixed by special boundary conditions. We show that these brackets can be modified by adding some surface terms to lift this restriction. The new brackets generalize a canonical bracket considered by Lewis, Marsden, Montgomery and Ratiu for the free boundary problem in hydrodynamics. Our definition of Poisson brackets permits to treat boundary values of a field on equal footing with its internal values and directly estimate the brackets between both surface and volume integrals. This construction is applied to any local form of Poisson brackets. A prescription for delta-function on closed domains and a definition of the {\it full} variational derivative are proposed. "
"We show that the recent measurements of the total photoproduction cross section at HERA energies [1] are in agreement with our earlier prediction based on high-energy hadronic structure of the photon in the QCD minijet-type model [2]. We discuss an improved calculation of the photoproduction cross section, in which the soft part, motivated by the Regge theory, is taken to be energy-dependent and the semi-hard hadronic part is carefully eikonalized to take into account for the multiple scatterings and to include the appropriate hadronic probability of the photon [3]. We show that the extrapolation of our cross section to ultra-high energies, of relevance to the cosmic ray physics, gives significant contribution to the ``conventional'' value, but cannot account for the anomalous muon content observed in the cosmic ray air-showers associated with astrophysical point sources [4]. (invited talk presented at QCD Recontres de Moriond 1993) "
We investigate the cosmological consequences of having quantum fields living in a space with compactified dimensions. We will show that the equation of state is not modified by topological effects and so the dynamics of the universe remains as it is in the infinite volume limit. On the contrary the thermal history of the universe depends on terms that are associated with having non-trivial topology. In the conclusions we discuss some issues about the relationship between the $c=1$ non-critical string-inspired cosmology and the result obtained with matter given by a hot massless field in $S^{1}\times \mbox{\bf R}$. 
"We construct level-0 modules of the quantum affine algebra $\Uq$, as the $q$-deformed version of the Lie algebra loop module construction. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the modules to be irreducible. We construct the crystal base for some of these modules and find significant differences from the case of highest weight modules. We also consider the role of loop modules in the recent scheme for diagonalising certain quantum spin chains using their $\Uq$ symmetry. "
"In the framework of the Joos-Weinberg 2(2S+1)- theory for massless particles, the dynamical invariants have been derived from the Lagrangian density which is considered to be a 4- vector. A la Majorana interpretation of the 6- component ""spinors"", the field operators of S=1 particles, as the left- and right-circularly polarized radiation, leads us to the conserved quantities which are analogous to those obtained by Lipkin and Sudbery. The scalar Lagrangian of the Joos-Weinberg theory is shown to be equivalent to the Lagrangian of a free massless field, introduced by Hayashi. As a consequence of a new ""gauge"" invariance this skew-symmetric field describes physical particles with the longitudinal components only. The interaction of the spinor field with the Weinberg's 2(2S+1)- component massless field is considered. New interpretation of the Weinberg field function is proposed.

"The object of this paper is to describe a simple method for proving that certain groups are residually torsion-free nilpotent, to describe some new parafree groups and to raise some new problems in honour of the memory of Wilhelm Magnus. "
"The structure of polyhomogeneous space-times (i.e., space-times with metrics which admit an expansion in terms of $r^{-j}\log^i r$) constructed by a Bondi--Sachs type method is analysed. The occurrence of some log terms in an asymptotic expansion of the metric is related to the non--vanishing of the Weyl tensor at Scri. Various quantities of interest, including the Bondi mass loss formula, the peeling--off of the Riemann tensor and the Newman--Penrose constants of motion are re-examined in this context. "
"The process $p \pbar \rightarrow W^{\pm}\gamma + X \rightarrow \ell^\pm \nu \gamma + X$ is calculated to ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$ for general $CP$ conserving $WW\gamma$ couplings. At the Tevatron center of mass energy, the QCD corrections to $W\gamma$ production are modest, and the Born and inclusive ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$ cross sections have similar sensitivities to the effects of anomalous couplings. At supercollider energies, the inclusive QCD corrections are large at high photon transverse momenta, reducing the sensitivity to non-standard $WW\gamma$ couplings by up to a factor~2. The size of the QCD corrections can be reduced significantly, and a large fraction of the sensitivity lost can be regained, if a jet veto is imposed. "
"The ""problem of time"" in canonical quantum gravity refers to the difficulties involved in defining a Hilbert space structure on states -- and local observables on this Hilbert space -- for a theory in which the spacetime metric is treated as a quantum field, so no classical metrical or causal structure is present on spacetime. We describe an approach -- much in the spirit of ideas proposed by Misner, Kuchar and others -- to defining states and local observables in quantum gravity which exploits the analogy between the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity and that of a relativistic particle. In the case ofminisuperspace models, a concrete theory is obtained which appears to be mathematically and physically viable, although it contains some radical features with regard to the presence of an ""arrow of time"". The viability of this approach in the case ofinfinitely many degrees of freedom rests on a number of fairlywell defined issues, which, however, remain unresolved. As a byproduct of our analysis, the theory of a relativistic particle in curved spacetime is developed. "
"The free energy and local height probabilities of the dilute A models with broken $\Integer_2$ symmetry are calculated analytically using inversion and corner transfer matrix methods. These models possess four critical branches. The first two branches provide new realisations of the unitary minimal series and the other two branches give a direct product of this series with an Ising model. We identify the integrable perturbations which move the dilute A models away from the critical limit. Generalised order parameters are defined and their critical exponents extracted. The associated conformal weights are found to occur on the diagonal of the relevant Kac table. In an appropriate regime the dilute A$_3$ model lies in the universality class of the Ising model in a magnetic field. In this case we obtain the magnetic exponent $\delta=15$ directly, without the use of scaling relations. "
"We study the cosmological solutions of the two-dimensional Brans-Dicke equations considering a gas of $c=1$ strings in $S^{1}\times \mbox{\bf R}$ as the source of the gravitational field. We also study the implications of the $R$-duality invariance on the solutions. To this purpose we conjecture that, as it happens for massless fields in finite boxes, the free energy of a gas of massless string excitations is not given by the corresponding toroidal compactification. "
"We derive two new integral mass formulas for stationary black holes in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory. From these we derive a formula for $ \J \Omega -Q V $, from which it follows immediately that any stationary, nonrotating, uncharged black hole is static and has vanishing electric field on the static slices. In the Einstein-Maxwell case, we have, in addition, the ``generalized Smarr mass formula"", for which we provide a new, simple derivation. When combined with the other two formulas, we obtain a simple proof that nonrotating Einstein-Maxwell black holes must be static and have vanishing magnetic field on the static slices. Our mass formulas also can be generalized to cases with other types of matter fields, and we describe the nature of these generalizations. "
"The $N=\infty$ vector $O(N)$ model is a solvable, interacting field theory in three dimensions ($D$). In a recent paper with A. Chubukov and J. Ye~\cite{self}, we have computed a universal number, $\tilde{c}$, characterizing the size dependence of the free energy at the conformally-invariant critical point of this theory. The result~\cite{self} for $\tilde{c}$ can be expressed in terms of polylogarithms. Here, we use non-trivial polylogarithm identities to show that $\tilde{c}/N = 4/5$, a rational number; this result is curiously parallel to recent work on dilogarithm identities in $D=2$ conformal theories. The amplitude of the stress-stress correlator of this theory, $c$ (which is the analog of the central charge), is determined to be $c/N=3/4$, also rational. Unitary conformal theories in $D=2$ always have $c = \tilde{c}$; thus such a result is clearly not valid in $D=3$. "
"A simple proof of a strengthened form of the first law of black hole mechanics is presented. The proof is based directly upon the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity, and it shows that the the first law variational formula holds for arbitrary nonsingular, asymptotically flat perturbations of a stationary, axisymmetric black hole, not merely for perturbations to other stationary, axisymmetric black holes. As an application of this strengthened form of the first law, we prove that there cannot exist Einstein-Maxwell black holes whose ergoregion is disjoint from the horizon. This closes a gap in the black hole uniqueness theorems. "
"To examine how peculiar velocities can affect the 2-, 3-, and 4-point redshift correlation functions, we evaluate volume-average correlations for configurations that emphasize and minimize redshift distortions for four different volume-limited samples from each of the CfA, SSRS, and IRAS redshift catalogs. We find a characteristic distortion for the 2-point correlation, $\xibar_2$: the slope $\gamma$ is flatter and the correlation length is larger in redshift space than in real space; that is, redshift distortions ``move'' correlations from small to large scales. At the largest scales (up to $12 \Mpc$), the extra power in the redshift distribution is compatible with $\Omega^{4/7}/b \approx 1$. We estimate $\Omega^{4/7}/b$ to be $0.53 \pm 0.15$, $1.10 \pm 0.16$ and $0.84 \pm 0.45$ for the CfA, SSRS and IRAS catalogs. Higher order correlations $\xibar_3$ and $\xibar_4$ suffer similar redshift distortions, but in such a way that, within the accuracy of our analysis, the normalized amplitudes $S_3$ and $S_4$ are insensitive to this effect. The hierarchical amplitudes $S_3$ and $S_4$ are constant as a function of scale between 1--$12 \Mpc$ and have similar values in all samples and catalogues, $S_3 \approx 2$ and $S_4 \approx 6$, despite the fact that $\xibar_2$, $\xibar_3$, and $\xibar_4$ differ from one sample to another by large factors (up to a factor of 4 in $\xibar_2$, 8 for $\xibar_3$, and 12 for $\xibar_4$). The agreement between the independent estimations of $S_3$ and $S_4$ "
"CP violation due to interference between $K_L$ and $K_S$ decays into $\pi ^+\pi^-\gamma$ is analyzed in the Standard Model. The CP-violating parameter $\epsilon'_{+- \gamma}$, which is the difference between $\eta_{+-\gamma}$ and $\eta_{+-}$, receives dominant contributions from $K^0-\bar{K}^0$ mixing and the gluon penguin diagram; its magnitude is calculated to be $10^{-2}\epsilon$ at a typical region of the Dalitz plot. Genuine direct CP violation in $K_L\to\pi^+ \pi^-\gamma$ decay originating from the electromagnetic penguin diagram is of order $10^{-4}\epsilon$. "
Certain infinite families of operator identities related to powers of positive root generators of (super) Lie algebras of first-order differential operators and $q$-deformed algebras of first-order finite-difference operators are presented. 
"We examine constraints on a simple neutrino model in which there are three massless and three massive Dirac neutrinos and in which the left handed neutrinos are linear combinations of doublet and singlet neutrinos. We examine constraints from direct decays into heavy neutrinos, indirect effects on electroweak parameters, and flavor changing processes. We combine these constraints to examine the allowed mass range for the heavy neutrinos of each of the three generations. "
"We present an approach to bosonic ($Z^0, W^{\pm}$) as well as fermionic (top-quark) Breit-Wigner propagators which is consistent with gauge invariance arguments. In particular, for the $Z^0$-boson propagator we extend previous analyses and show that the part proportional to $k_{\mu} k_{\nu}/M^2$ must be modified near the resonance. We derive a mass shift which agrees with results obtained elsewhere by different methods. The modified form of a resonant heavy fermion propagator is also given. "
"It is shown that the Wheeler DeWitt constraint of canonical gravity coupled to Klein Gordon scalar fields and expressed in terms of Ashtekar's variables admits formal solutions which are parametrized by loops in the three dimensional hypersurface and which are extensions of the well known Wilson loop solutions found by Jacobson, Rovelli and Smolin. "
"We present supersymmetric soliton solutions of the four-dimensional heterotic string corresponding to monopoles, strings and domain walls. These solutions admit the $D=10$ interpretation of a fivebrane wrapped around $5$, $4$ or $3$ of the $6$ toroidally compactified dimensions and are arguably exact to all orders in $\alpha'$. The solitonic string solution exhibits an $SL(2,Z)$ {\it strong/weak coupling} duality which however corresponds to an $SL(2,Z)$ {\it target space} duality of the fundamental string. "
"As is known, tetrahedron equations lead to the commuting family of transfer-matrices and provide the integrability of corresponding three-dimensional lattice models. We present the modified version of these equations which give the commuting family of more complicated two-layer transfer-matrices. In the static limit we have succeeded in constructing the solution of these equations in terms of elliptic functions. "
"We emphasise the EMC spin effect as a problem of symmetry and discuss the renormalisation of the $C=+1$ axial tensor operators. This involves the generalisation of the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly to each of these operators. We find that the contribution of the axial anomaly to the spin dependent structure function $g_1 (x, Q^2)$ scales at $O(\alpha_s)$. This means that the anomaly can be a large $x$ effect in $g_1$. Finally we discuss the jet signature of the anomaly. "
We introduce a data analysis procedure for color transparency experiments which is considerably less model dependent than the transparency ratio method. The new method is based on fitting the shape of the A dependence of the nuclear cross section at fixed momentum transfer to determine the effective attenuation cross section for hadrons propagating through the nucleus. The hard scattering cross section is then determined directly from the data. We apply this procedure to the Brookhaven experiment of Carroll et al and find that it clearly shows color transparency: the effective attenuation cross section in events with momentum transfer $Q^2$ is approximately $40\ mb\ (2.2\ GeV^2/Q^2)$. The fit to the data also supports the idea that the hard scattering inside the nuclear medium is closer to perturbative QCD predictions than is the scattering of isolated protons in free space. We discuss the application of our approach to electroproduction experiments. 
"The effects of columnar pins on the flux lines in a model High-Tc superconductor in an applied field are studied through Monte Carlo simulations. An analytic solution for a single line case is obtained and compared with the simulation results. By introducing a tilted potential, we study simulated ``IV"" characteristics and the results indicate a distinct scaling behavior above and below the depinning temperature. We introduce a diverging length scale measured in terms of a ``retrapping length'' to analyze self-similar behavior across the depinning transition. "
We derive an exact string-like soliton solution of D=10 heterotic string theory. The solution possesses $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ instanton structure in the eight-dimensional space transverse to the worldsheet of the soliton. 
"Let (M,g) be an oriented Lorentzian 4-manifold, and consider the space S of oriented, unparameterized time-like 2-surfaces in M (string world-sheets) with fixed boundary conditions. Then the infinite-dimensional manifold S carries a natural complex structure and a compatible (positive-definite) Kaehler metric h on S determined by the Lorentz metric g. Similar results are proved for other dimensions and signatures, thus generalizing results of Brylinski regarding knots in 3-manifolds. Generalizing the framework of Lempert, we also investigate the precise sense in which S is an infinite-dimensional complex manifold. "
"Previous efforts to find evidence of deterministic nonlinear dynamics in the global geomagnetic system have treated the geomagnetic system as autonomous. However, the geomagnetic system is strongly driven by the stochastic solar wind. We consider the response of the magnetosphere, as given by the AE index, for one day when the IMF had a nearly constant southward value. Using both a series of non-linear statistics and non-linear prediction of the response to the input signal $v B_s$, we find that there is some evidence for deterministic non-linear response of the Earth's magnetosphere on that day. "
"The pattern of soft photon radiation in $\ee\to\ww$ has a rich structure, with contributions from photon emission off the initial state and off the final state particles both before and after decay. In particular, the interference between the contributions involving the decaying $W$'s depends on the decay width. We review the theoretical result for the radiation pattern, and present predictions for LEP200, {\it i.e.} in $\ee$ annihilation just above $\ww$ threshold. "
"$SU(N)$ gauge fields on a cylindrical spacetime are canonically quantized via two routes revealing almost equivalent but different quantizations. After removing all continuous gauge degrees of freedom, the canonical coordinate $A_\mu$ (in the Cartan subalgebra $\h$) is quantized. The compact route, as in lattice gauge theory, quantizes the Wilson loop $W$, projecting out gauge invariant wavefunctions on the group manifold $G$. After a Casimir energy related to the curvature of $SU(N)$ is added to the compact spectrum, it is seen to be a subset of the non-compact spectrum. States of the two quantizations with corresponding energy are shifted relative each other, such that the ground state on $G$, $\chi_0(W)$, is the first excited state $\Psi_1(A_\mu)$ on $\h$. The ground state $\Psi_0(A_\mu)$ does not appear in the character spectrum as its lift is not globally defined on $G$. Implications for lattice gauge theory and the sum over maps representation of two dimensional QCD are discussed. "
"It is believed that most quasars and galaxies present two common features: the presence in their core of a supermassive object, and the experience of one or more encounters with other galaxies. In this scenario, it is likely that a substantial fraction of active galactic nuclei harbour a supermassive binary, fueled by an accretion disk. These binaries would certainly be among the strongest sources of sinusoidal gravitational waves. We investigate their evolution considering, simultaneously, the accretion of the black hole's masses from the disk, and the gravitational waves emitted during the orbital motion. We also consider other astrophysical scenarios involving a coalescing binary with non constant masses. "
"We use nonlinear signal processing techniques, based on artificial neural networks, to construct an empirical mapping from experimental Rayleigh-Benard convection data in the quasiperiodic regime. The data, in the form of a one-parameter sequence of Poincare sections in the interior of a mode-locked region (resonance horn), are indicative of a complicated interplay of local and global bifurcations with respect to the experimentally varied Rayleigh number. The dynamic phenomena apparent in the data include period doublings, complex intermittent behavior, secondary Hopf bifurcations, and chaotic dynamics. We use the fitted map to reconstruct the experimental dynamics and to explore the associated local and global bifurcation structures in phase space. Using numerical bifurcation techniques we locate the stable and unstable periodic solutions, calculate eigenvalues, approximate invariant manifolds of saddle type solutions and identify bifurcation points. This approach constitutes a promising data post-processing procedure for investigating phase space and parameter space of real experimental systems; it allows us to infer phase space structures which the experiments can only probe with limited measurement precision and only at a discrete number of operating parameter settings. "
We show that the bosonic string theory quantized in the Beltrami parametrization possesses a supersymmetric structure like the vector-supersymmetry already observed in topological field theories. 
"We present a new class of exact solutions for the so-called {\it Laplacian Growth Equation} describing the zero-surface-tension limit of a variety of 2D pattern formation problems. Contrary to common belief, we prove that these solutions are free of finite-time singularities (cusps) for quite general initial conditions and may well describe real fingering instabilities. At long times the interface consists of N separated moving Saffman-Taylor fingers, with ``stagnation points'' in between, in agreement with numerous observations. This evolution resembles the N-soliton solution of classical integrable PDE's. "
"We compare the results for the dynamical evolution of star clusters derived from anisotropic gaseous models with the data from N-body simulations of isolated and one-component systems, each having modest number of stars. The statistical quality of N-body data was improved by averaging results from many N-body runs, each with the same initial parameters but with different sequences of random numbers used to initialize positions and velocities of the particles. We study the development of anisotropy, the spatial evolution and energy generation by three-body binaries and its N-dependence. We estimate the following free parameters of anisotropic gaseous models: the time scale for collisional anisotropy decay and the coefficient in the formulae for energy generation by three-body binaries. To achieve a fair agreement between N-body and gaseous models for the core in pre- as well as in post-collapse only the energy generation by binaries had to be varied by N. We find that anisotropy has considerable influence on the spatial structure of the cluster particularly for the intermediate and outer regions. "
"We construct a realization of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{sl_N})$ of an arbitrary level $k$ in terms of free boson fields. In the $q\!\rightarrow\! 1$ limit this realization becomes the Wakimoto realization of $\widehat{sl_N}$. The screening currents and the vertex operators(primary fields) are also constructed; the former commutes with $U_q(\widehat{sl_N})$ modulo total difference, and the latter creates the $U_q(\widehat{sl_N})$ highest weight state from the vacuum state of the boson Fock space. "
We review a new systematic data analysis procedure for color transparency experiments and its application to the proton nucleus scattering experiment. The method extracts the hard scattering rate as well as the survival probability for the protons travelling through the nucleus directly from the data. The method requires modelling of the nuclear attenuation in terms of an effective nucleon-nucleon cross section. We can minimize this model dependence by introducing a new scaling law analysis procedure which can yield considerable information with very little theoretical input. With sufficient data the functional forms of the survival probability as well as the hard scattering can be extracted without any theoretical modelling. An analysis of the BNL data of Carroll {\it et al} shows clear evidence for observation of color transparency. 
"A generalization of the Yang-Baxter equation is proposed. It enables to construct integrable two-dimensional lattice models with commuting two-layer transfer matrices, while single-layer ones are not necessarily commutative. Explicit solutions to the generalized equations are found. They are related with Botzmann weights of the $sl(3)$ chiral Potts model. "
"We show generally that in thermal gravity, the one-particle irreducible 2-point function depends on the choice of the basic graviton fields. We derive the relevant properties of a physical graviton self-energy, which is independent of the parametrization of the graviton field. An explicit expression for the graviton self-energy at high-temperature is given to one-loop order. "
"We propose a resolution of the puzzle posed by the discrepancy between the pion-nucleon sigma term inferred from pion-nucleon scattering, and that deduced from baryon mass splittings using the Zweig rule. We show that there is a significant hypercharge-dependent dynamical contribution to baryon masses, not hitherto included in the analysis, which may be estimated using the scale Ward identity, and computed by solution of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the quark self-energy. We find that the discrepancy is completely resolved without the need for any Zweig rule violation. "
"We discuss the role of the U(1) axial anomaly in the spin structure functions of the nucleon, with particular emphasis on how one might determine its x dependence in present and future deep inelastic scattering experiments. We focus on the C-odd spin structure function g3 and also the deuteron structure function g1^d. "
"A fit is made to the data for the proton structure function up to Q^2=10 GeV^2, including the real gamma p total cross-section. It is economical and simple, and its form is motivated by physical principles. It is extrapolated down to very small values of x. Data for the ratio (nu W_2^n/nu W_2^p) are also fitted. A FORTRAN program for the fit to (nu W_2^p) is available by email on request Figure 5 from the original version has been deleted. "
"Starting from the 4-dimensional gluodynamics, we discuss the statistical ensemble of torons ( the toron is a self-dual solution with fractional topological number; it can be understood as a point defect) which interact strongly. It is shown that the effective Lagrangian describing this statistical ensemble possesses the fourth derivative kinetic term and leads to the area law for the Wilson loop. Besides that we derive the effective string action containing the rigid (extrinsic curvature) term as a consequence of the fourth derivative action. "
"We analyze the exact behavior of the renormalization group flow in one-dimensional clock-models which undergo first order phase transitions by the presence of complex interactions. The flow, defined by decimation, is shown to be single-valued and continuous throughout its domain of definition, which contains the transition points. This fact is in disagreement with a recently proposed scenario for first order phase transitions claiming the existence of discontinuities of the renormalization group. The results are in partial agreement with the standard scenario. However in the vicinity of some fixed points of the critical surface the renormalized measure does not correspond to a renormalized Hamiltonian for some choices of renormalization blocks. These pathologies although similar to Griffiths-Pearce pathologies have a different physical origin: the complex character of the interactions. We elucidate the dynamical reason for such a pathological behavior: entire regions of coupling constants blow up under the renormalization group transformation. The flows provide non-perturbative patterns for the renormalization group behavior of electric conductivities in the quantum Hall effect. "
"Operator angle-action variables are studied in the frame of the SU(2) algebra, and their eigenstates and coherent states are discussed. The quantum mechanical addition of action-angle variables is shown to lead to a novel non commutative Hopf algebra. The group contraction is used to make the connection with the harmonic oscillator. "
"Starting from a potential with a continuum of energy eigenstates, we show how the methods of supersymmetric quantum mechanics can be used to generate families of potentials with bound states in the continuum [BICs]. We also find the corresponding wave functions. Our method preserves the spectrum of the original potential except it adds these discrete BICs at selected energies. Specifically, we compute and graph potentials which have bound states in the continuum starting from a null potential representing a free particle and from both the attractive and the repulsive Coulomb potentials. "
"In this paper there we describe the calculational background of deriving a strong meson Lagrangian from the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio quark model using the computer algebra systems FORM and REDUCE in recursive algorithms, based on the heat-kernel method for the calculation of the quark determinant. "
"We study in detail the prediction for the semileptonic decays $\bar{B} \to D (D^*) \pi \ell \bar{\nu}$ by heavy quark and chiral symmetry. The branching ratio for $\bar{B} \to D \pi \ell \bar{\nu}$ is quite significant, as big as $(0.5-1)\%$. The branching ratio for $\bar{B} \to D^* \pi \ell \bar{\nu}$ is only of order $10^{-4}-10^{-5}$. Numerical results for various single particle spectra and their dependence on the pion momentum cutoff schemes are presented in a series of figures, as are the model independent ratios for differential rates of $D$ and $D^*$. We also study the parity-violation effects on the decay rates for different polarization states of the $D^*$. Figures may be obtained by anonymous FTP from strange.tn.cornell.edu in the directory pub/CLNS931204, or by email from the author. "
"We have carried out spectrum calculations with two flavors of dynamical Kogut-Susskind quarks on four lattice sizes from $8^3\times 24$ to $16^3\times24$ at couplings that correspond to chiral symmetry restoration for a lattice with 6 time slices. We estimate that the linear spatial sizes of the lattices range from 1.8 to 3.6 fm. We find significant finite size effects for all particles between the smallest and largest volume with the larger quark mass that we study, $am_q=0.025$, where $a$ is the lattice spacing. The nucleon experiences the largest effect of about 6 percent. We also study a lighter quark mass, $am_q=0.0125$, on the two largest lattices. Effects of the dynamical and valence quark masses on the hadron spectrum are studied both directly, by comparing the two simulations, and by extracting mass derivatives from the correlation functions. We do not find much improvement in the nucleon to rho mass ratio as we decrease the quark mass at this lattice spacing. Finally, we report on an unsuccessful attempt to see effects of the $\rho \rightarrow 2\pi$ decay on the $\rho$ mass, and on studies of Wilson and Kogut-Susskind hadron masses with large valence quark masses. (The paper is also available via anonymous ftp in a compressed PostScript file: fuji.physics.indiana.edu:/pub/milc/paper.ps.Z .) "
"Quantum fluctuations, through quantum corrections, have the potential to lead to irreversibility in quantum field theory. We consider the virtual ``charge"" distribution generated by quantum corrections in the leading log, short range approximation, and adopt for it a statistical interpretation. This virtual charge density has fractal structure, and it is seen that, independently of whether the theory is or is not asymptotically free, it describes a system where the equilibrium state is at its classical limit ($\hbar \rightarrow 0$). We also present a simple analysis of how diffusion of the charge density proceeds as a function of the distance at which the system is probed. "
"We analyze the finite size scaling of the $q$-state clock model in the $q \rightarrow \infty$ limit. The behaviors of the specific heat, Binder-Landau and U4 cumulants agree with the Borgs-Koteck\'y ans\""atz for first order phase transitions. However, we find that the leading correction to the position of the extremal points of these quantities is not universal. On the other hand, the finite size corrections to the mass gap behave like for second order phase transitions. In particular, the curves corresponding to different size approximations do not cross in the vicinity of the transition points. The feature is associated to the existence of a divergent correlation length and holds for a wider class of models. "
"We investigate the implications of neutrino electromagnetic dipole moments for the radiative decay $\pi \rightarrow e \nu \gamma$. We show that the dominant new effect comes from the interference between the amplitude of the process with the photon emitted by the neutrino and the structure dependent standard amplitude. Such interference takes place only if the massive neutrino is a Majorana fermion. Moreover, since electric and magnetic dipole moments give rise to contributions with opposite signs, future experiments might be able to distinguish between them. "
"A survey is made of some recent ideas and progress in the phenomenological applications of Supersymmetry (SUSY). We describe the success of SUSY-GUT models, the expected experimental signatures and present limits on SUSY partner particles, and the phenomenology of Higgs bosons in the minimal SUSY model.} "
The amplitudes of $K \rightarrow \pi \gamma^* \rightarrow \pi e^+e^-$ and $K \rightarrow \pi \pi \gamma$ decays have been calculated within chiral Lagrangian approach including higher-order derivative terms and meson loops. The selfconsistency of the simultaneous description of the experimental data on the nonleptonic and radiative kaon decays have been demonstrated. We estimate the effects of ``indirect'' and ``direct'' $CP$-violation in $K^0_L \rightarrow \pi^0 e^+e^-$ decays and discuss $CP$-violating charge asymmetries in $K^{\pm} \rightarrow \pi^{\pm} \pi^0 \gamma$ decays. 
"We show that a large class of physical theories which has been under intensive investigation recently, share the same geometric features in their Hamiltonian formulation. These dynamical systems range from harmonic oscillations to WZW-like models and to the KdV dynamics on $Diff_oS^1$. To the same class belong also the Hamiltonian systems on groups of maps. The common feature of these models are the 'chiral' equations of motion allowing for so-called chiral decomposition of the phase space. "
"We discuss the unexpected enhancement of the $N^*$ electroproduction on nuclei recently observed in the $(\gamma^*,p\pi^-)$ measurement. A mechanism which is able to explain this result is proposed. To clarify the situation, we suggest to perform a new kind of experiment within well specified kinematic conditions. "
"A new mechanism is presented for the generation of quark and lepton masses, based on a heavy fourth family and a new sector of massless fermions. The massless fermions have only discrete chiral symmetries and they are confined by the metacolor force. The resulting electroweak corrections may be smaller than in technicolor theories. "
"Applying a variational method to a Gaussian wave ansatz, we have derived a set of semi-classical evolution equations for SU(2) lattice gauge fields, which take the classical form in the limit of a vanishing width of the Gaussian wave packet. These equations are used to study the quantum effects on the classical evolutions of the lattice gauge fields. "
We study the relation between the Majorana neutrino mass matrices and the neutrinoless double beta decay when CP is not conserved. We give an explicit form of the decay rate in terms of a rephasing invariant quantity and demonstrate that in the presence of CP violation it is impossible to have vanishing neutrinoless double beta decay in the case of two neutrino generations (or when the third generation leptons do not mix with other leptons and hence decouple). 
"The new type of solutions of the London equation for type-II superconductors is obtained to describe the ring-shaped (toroidal) Abrikosov vortices. The specific feature of these solutions is the self-consistent localization of both the supercurrent and the magnetic field, enabling one to construct compact magnetic structures inside a superconductor. The torus vortex contraction caused by the vortex instability leads to the destruction of the Cooper pairing and the formation of a normal electron stream in the vicinity of the torus axis. The thermodynamic condition for the excitation of a small closed vortex by a bunch of charged particles contains the fine-structure constant as a determining parameter. "
We present an analysis of the enhancement of CP-violating charge asymmetries in $K \rightarrow 3\pi$ decays. Calculations of decay amplitudes are performed on the basis of bosonized strong and weak Lagrangians derived from QCD-motivated quark Lagrangians. We show that the interplay of fourth-order contributions of chiral Lagrangians for strong interactions and penguin operators in weak interactions significantly enhances the charge asymmetries.

"This is the transcript of a talk given at the 1992 Complex Systems Summer School. The theory of large fluctuations of stochastically perturbed continuous-time dynamical systems is reviewed, and the large fluctuations of two stochastic models arising in computer science are analysed. One is a stochastic model of a communications network, resembling an Ethernet, which experiences traffic fluctuations. The other is a simple model of two dynamic data structures in the same memory space. In both models `large fluctuations' are unlikely, undesirable events. The mean time between occurrences of such events is estimated. "
This preprint is based on two articles accepted by MNRAS and ApJ. Our aim is to study the evolution of the orbit of a star under the influence of interactions with an accretion disc in an AGN. The model considered consists of a low-mass compact object orbiting a supermassive black hole and colliding periodically with the accretion disc. Gravitational field of the nucleus is described by the Kerr metric. The star is assumed to move along a geodesic arc between successive interactions with an equatorial accretion disc. We study the gravitomagnetic (Lense-Thirring) precession of the trajectory. We do not assume any particular value for the eccentricity or inclination of the orbit or the angular momentum of the black hole. We also discuss the periodicity related to the relativistic shift of the pericenter. The model of star-disc interactions has been suggested to explain the X-ray variability observed in the Seyfert galaxy NGC~6814. We briefly discuss on this subject. 
"$K\pi$ scattering and $K_{\mu 4}$ decays are studied at leading order of improved chiral perturbation theory. It is shown that high precision $K_{\mu 4}$ experiments at, e.g., DA$\Phi$NE should allow for a direct measurement of the quark mass ratio $m_s$/${\hat m}$. "
"Affine Toda theory is a relativistic integrable theory in two dimensions possessing solutions describing a number of different species of solitons when the coupling is chosen to be imaginary. These nevertheless carry real energy and momentum. To each species of soliton there has to correspond an antisoliton species. There are two different ways of realising the antisoliton whose equivalence is shown to follow from a surprising identity satisfied within the underlying affine Kac-Moody group. This is the classical analogue of the crossing property of analytic S-matrix theory. Since a complex parameter related to the coordinate of the soliton is inverted, this identity implies a sort of modular transformation property of the soliton solution. The results simplify calculations of explicit soliton solutions. "
"The one-- and two-- particle densities of up to four interacting electrons with spin, confined within a quasi one--dimensional ``quantum dot'' are calculated by numerical diagonalization. The transition from a dense homogeneous charge distribution to a dilute localized Wigner--type electron arrangement is investigated. The influence of the long range part of the Coulomb interaction is studied. When the interaction is exponentially cut off the ``crystallized'' Wigner molecule is destroyed in favor of an inhomogeneous charge distribution similar to a charge density wave . "
"We review the physics assumptions and input used in ISAJET~7.0 / ISA\-SUSY~1.0 that are relevant for simulating fundamental processes within the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) at $p\bar p$ and $pp$ colliders. After a brief discussion of the underlying MSSM framework, we discuss event simulation and list the sparticle production processes and decay modes that have been incorporated into our calculations. We then describe how to set up and run an ISAJET / ISASUSY job and the user input and output formats. The ISAJET program is sufficiently flexible that some non-minimal supersymmetry scenarios may be simulated as well. Finally, plans for future upgrades which include the extension to $e^+ e^-$ collisions, are listed. "
The nonlinear equations describing phase ordering dynamics can be closed by assuming the existence of an underlying Gaussian stochastic field which is nonlinearly related to the observable order parameter field. We discuss the relation between different implementations of the Gaussian assumption and consider the limitations of this assumption for phase ordering dynamics. The fact that the different approaches gives different results is a sign of the breakdown of the Gaussian assumption. We concentrate on the non-conserved order parameter case but also touch on the conserved order parameter case. We demonstrate that the Gaussian assumption is fundamentally flawed in the latter case. 
"We study the rate for the production of ${B B^\pm \pi^\mp}$, where the sign of the charged pion tags the flavor content of the neutral $B$ meson. We estimate this branching ratio, employing the heavy meson chiral effective theory. We find that at center of mass energy of approximately 12 GeV, a $B$ meson pair should be produced as often with and without an accompanying charged pion. We also calculate two pion production at this center of mass energy, and find that it is negligible, as is the rate for rho production. We consider the implications for CP violation studies. (Invited Talk, 1993 Electroweak Rencontres de Moriond) "
"A new local world volume supersymmetric Lagrangian for the bosonic membrane is presented. The starting Lagrangian is the one constructed by Dolan and Tchrakian with vanishing cosmological constant, with quadratic and quartic derivative terms. Our Lagrangian differs from the one constructed by Lindstrom and Rocek in the fact that it is polynomial in the fields facilitating the quantization process. It is argued, rigorously, that if one wishes to construct polynomial actions without a curvature scalar term and, where supersymmetry is linearly realized in the space of physical fields, after the elimination of auxiliary fields, one must relinquish $S$ supersymmetry, altogether, and concentrate solely on the $Q$ supersymmetry associated with the superconformal algebra in three dimensions. A full $''Q+S''$ supersymmetry cannot be implemented in a linearly realized way satisfying all of the above-mentioned requirements, unless a non-polynomial action is chosen. PACS:04.65.+e, 04.20.Fy. "
"The dynamics of the 3 dimensional perfect fluid is equivalent to the motion of vortex filaments or ""strings"". We study the action principle and find that it is described by the Hopf term of the nonlinear sigma model. The Poisson bracket structure is described by the loop algebra, for example, the Virasoro algebra or the analogue of O(3) current algebra. As a string theory, it is quite different from the standard Nambu-Goto string in its coupling to the extrinsic geometry. We also analyze briefly the two dimsensional case and give some emphasis on the $w_{1+\infty}$ structure. "
"We study the trajectories followed by a particle subjected to weak noise when escaping from the domain of attraction of a stable fixed point. If detailed balance is absent, a _focus_ may occur along the most probable exit path, leading to a breakdown of symmetry (if present). The exit trajectory bifurcates, and the exit location distribution may become `skewed' (non-Gaussian). The weak-noise asymptotics of the mean escape time are strongly affected. Our methods extend to the study of skewed exit location distributions in stochastic models without symmetry. "
"In the low energy domain, Chiral Perturbation Theory parametrizes the small chiral symmetry breaking effects, produced by the quark masses $m_u$, $m_d$ and $m_s$, in terms of order parameters of massless QCD. The latter can then, in principle, be measured in high precision, low energy experiments. We discuss several relevant processes and possible improvements at future high luminosity tau/charm or K factories. (talk given at the XXVIIIth Rencontres de Moriond on QCD and High Energy Hadronic Interactions, Les Arcs (France), March 20-27 1993.) "
"We investigate the canonical quantization of gravity coupled to pointlike matter in 2+1 dimensions. Starting from the usual point particle action in the first order formalism, we introduce auxiliary variables which make the action locally Poincar\'e invariant. A Hamiltonian analysis shows that the gauge group is actually larger than the Poincar\'e group -- certain additional gauge constraints are present which act on the matter degrees of freedom. These additional constraints are necessary to mimic the diffeomorphism invariance present if the theory is formulated with a spacetime metric. The additional gauge constraints are realized projectively in the quantum theory, with a phase in the composition law for finite gauge transformations. That phase is responsible for the braid invariance of physical observables (holonomies). "
Results for the isovector axial form factors of the proton from a lattice QCD calculation are presented for both point-split and local currents. They are obtained on a quenched $16^{3} \times 24$ lattice at $\beta= 6.0$ with Wilson fermions for a range of quark masses from strange to charm. We determine the finite lattice renormalization for both the local and point-split currents of heavy quarks. Results extrapolated to the chiral limit show that the $q^2$ dependence of the axial form factor agrees reasonably well with experiment. The axial coupling constant $g_A$ calculated for the local and the point-split currents is about 6\% and 12\% smaller than the experimental value respectively. 
"We consider the inclusive cross section for jet production with large transverse momentum in deep-inelastic scattering. This process has been proposed as a probe of small-x physics, particularly the measurement of `hot spots' inside the proton. We present a numerical calculation of this process, taking into account a larger phase space. The theoretical reliability as well as phenomenological uncertainties of the calculation are discussed. "
"Starting from the characteristic polynomial for ordinary matrices we give a combinatorial deduction of the Mandelstam identities and viceversa, thus showing that the two sets of relations are equivalent. We are able to extend this construction to supermatrices in such a way that we obtain the Mandelstam identities in this case, once the corresponding characteristic equation is known. "
"Two--photon decays of Higgs bosons are important channels for the search of these particles in the intermediate mass range at the $pp$ colliders LHC and SSC. Dynamical aspects of the Higgs coupling to two photons can also be studied by means of the $\gamma \gamma$ fusion of Higgs particles at high--energy e$^+$e$^-$ linear colliders. Extending earlier analyses which had been restricted to the Standard Model, we present in this note the QCD radiative corrections to the $\gamma \gamma$ decay widths of scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs particles in multi--doublet extensions of the Higgs sector, as realized for instance in supersymmetric theories. "
"We discuss an infinite--dimensional k\""ahlerian manifold associated with the area--preserving diffeomorphisms on two--dimensional torus, and, correspondingly, with a continuous limit of the $A_r$--Toda system. In particular, a continuous limit of the $A_r$--Grassmannians and a related Pl\""ucker type formula are introduced as relevant notions for $W_{\infty}$--geometry of the self--dual Einstein space with the rotational Killing vector. "
"In this letter we present an operator formalism for Closed String Field Theory based on closed half-strings. Our results indicate that the restricted polyhedra of the classical non-polynomial string field theory, can be represented as traces of infinite matrices, with operator insertions that reparametrise the half-strings. "
"There is a great deal of interest in attributing the high critical temperatures of the cuprates to either the proximity of the Fermi level to a van Hove singularity or to structure of the superconducting pairing potential in momentum space far from the Fermi surface. We examine these ideas by calculating the critical temperature Tc for model Einstein-phonon- and spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductors within both the standard, Fermi-surface-restricted Eliashberg theory and the exact mean field theory, which accounts for the full momentum structure of the pairing potential and the energy dependence of the density of states. By using two models of spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing in the cuprates, we demonstrate that our results are independent of the details of the dynamical susceptibility, which is taken to be the pairing potential. We also compare these two models against available neutron scattering data, since these data provide the most direct constraints on the susceptibility. We conclude that the van Hove singularity does not drastically alter Tc from its value when the density of states is constant and that the effect of momentum structure is significant but secondary in importance to that of the energy dependence in the density of states. "
It is shown that the joint measurements of some physical variables corresponding to commuting operators performed on pre- and post-selected quantum systems invariably disturb each other. The significance of this result for recent proofs of the impossibility of realistic Lorentz invariant interpretation of quantum theory (without assumption of locality) is discussed. 
"We study the anyon statistics of a $2 + 1$ dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) gauge theory by using a systemmetic metheod, the Breit Hamiltonian formalism. "
"Recently \REF\dk{Simon Dalley and Igor Klebanov,'Light Cone Quantization of the $c=2$ Matrix Model', PUPT-1333, hepth@xxx/920705} \refend Dalley and Klebanov proposed a light-cone quantized study of the $c=2$ matrix model, but which ignores $k^{+}=0$ contributions. Since the non-critical string limit of the matrix model involves taking the parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$ of the matrix model to a critical point, zero modes of the field might be important in this study. The constrained light-cone quantization (CLCQ) approach of Heinzl, Krusche and Werner is applied . It is found that there is coupling between the zero mode sector and the rest of the theory, hence CLCQ should be implemented. "
Gamma ray production in supernova remnants is discussed on the basis of current ideas about cosmic ray acceleration. 
The outlook of a simple method to generate localized (soliton-like) potentials of time-dependent Schrodinger type equations is given. The conditions are discussed for the potentials to be real and nonsingular. For the derivative Schrodinger equation also is discussed its relation to the Ishimori-II model. Some pecular soliton solutions of nonlinear Schrodinger type equations are given and discussed. 
"The ionization history of the universe provides a major source of ambiguity in constraining cosmological models using small angular scale microwave background anisotropies. To clarify these issues, we consider a complete treatment of Compton scattering to second order, an approach which may be applicable to other astrophysical situations. We find that only the ${\cal O} (v)$ Doppler effect, and the ${\cal O} (v\delta)$ Vishniac effect are important for recent last scattering epochs; the ${\cal O} (v^2)$ Doppler effect is not significant on any angular scale, and other higher-order effects are completely negligible. However the ${\cal O}(v^2)$ effect does lead to \Cy\ distortions, which although generally below current constraints, set an unavoidable minimum level in reionization models. We consider the small-angle approximation for the Vishniac effect in detail, and show several improvements over previous treatments, particularly for low $\Omega_0$. For standard cold dark matter models, the effect of reionization is to redistribute the anisotropies to arcminute scales; late reionization leads to partially erased primary fluctuations and a secondary contribution of comparable magnitude. Using recent anisotropy limits from the ATCA experiment, we set new constraints on baryonic dark matter models. Stronger constraints are imposed (in second order) upon models with higher Hubble constant, steeper $n$, and higher density. These limits depend on the specific ionization history assumed, but the factor gained by lowering the ionization fraction is generally small, and may be tested by currently-planned "
"The helicity modulus for a fluctuating type II superconductor is computed within the elastic medium approximation, as a probe of superconducting phase coherence and the Meissner effect in the mixed state. We argue that at the vortex line lattice melting transition, there remains superconducting coherence parallel to the applied magnetic field, provided the vortex line liquid retains a finite shear modulus at finite wavevector. "
"The inverse ac Josephson effect involves rf-induced (Shapiro) steps that cross over the zero-current axis; the phenomenon is of interest in voltage standard applications. The standard analysis of the step height in current, which yields the well-known Bessel-function dependence on an effective ac drive amplitude, is valid only when the drive frequency is large compared with the junction plasma frequency or when the drive amplitude is large compared with the zero-voltage Josephson current. Using a first-order Krylov-Bogoliubov power-balance approach we derive an expression for the threshold value of the drive amplitude for zero-crossing steps that is not limited to the large frequency or large amplitude region. Comparison with numerical solutions of the RSJ differential equation shows excellent agreement for both fundamental and subharmonic steps. The power-balance value for the threshold converges to the Bessel-function value in the high- frequency limit. "
"The formation and evaporation of two dimensional black holes are discussed. It is shown that if the radiation in minimal scalars has positive energy, there must be a global event horizon or a naked singularity. The former would imply loss of quantum coherence while the latter would lead to an even worse breakdown of predictability. CPT invariance would suggest that there ought to be past horizons as well. A way in which this could happen with wormholes is described. "
To construct a quantum group gauge theory one needs an algebra which is invariant under gauge transformations. The existence of this invariant algebra is closely related with the existence of a differential algebra $\delta _{{\cal H}} G_{q}$ compatible with the Hopf algebra structure. It is shown that $\delta _{{\cal H}} G_{q}$ exists only for the quantum group $U_{q}(N)$ and that the quantum group $SU_q(N)$ as a quantum gauge group is not allowed. The representations of the algebra $\delta _{{\cal H}} G_{q}$ are con- structed. The operators corresponding to the differentials are realized via derivations on the space of all irreducible *-representations of $U_q(2)$. With the help of this construction infinitesimal gauge transformations in two-dimensional classical space-time are described. 
We investigate the relationship between the generalized uncertainty principle in quantum gravity and the quantum deformation of the Poincar\'e algebra. We find that a deformed Newton-Wigner position operator and the generators of spatial translations and rotations of the deformed Poincar\'e algebra obey a deformed Heisenberg algebra from which the generalized uncertainty principle follows. The result indicates that in the $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e algebra a minimal observable length emerges naturally. 
"We study higher order corrections to Higgs production with an associated jet at SSC energies, using the resummation of the leading logarithmic contributions to multiple gluon emissions due to Lipatov and collaborators. We find a considerable enhancement of Higgs production at large transverse momenta. "
"We study the finite temperature electroweak phase transition with lattice perturbation theory and Monte Carlo techniques. Dimensional reduction is used to approximate the full four-dimensional SU(2) + a fundamental doublet Higgs theory by an effective three-dimensional SU(2) + adjoint Higgs + fundamental Higgs theory with coefficients depending on temperature via screening masses and mass counterterms. Fermions contribute to the effective theory only via the $N_F$ and $m_{\rm top}$ dependence of the coefficients. For sufficiently small lattices ($N^3 < 30^3$ for $m_H$ = 35 GeV) the study of the one-loop lattice effective potential shows the existence of the {\em second} order phase transition even for the small Higgs masses. At the same time, a clear signal of a {\em first order} phase transition is seen on the lattice simulations with a transition temperature close to but less than the value determined from the perturbative calculations. This indicates that the dynamics of the first order electroweak phase transition depends strongly on non-perturbative effects and is not exclusively related to the so-called $\phi^3$ term in the effective potential. "
"There is a strong correlation between the $p_T$ and isolation of the lepton coming from $B$ decay. Consequently the isolated lepton background from $B$ decay goes down rapidly with increasing lepton $p_T$; and there is a $p_T$ cutoff beyond which it effectively vanishes. For the isolation cut of $E^{AC}_T < 10$ GeV, appropriate for LHC, the lepton $p_T$ cutoff is 80 GeV. This can be exploited to effectively eliminate the $B$ background from the like sign dilepton channel apropriate for Majorana particle searches, as well as the unlike sign dilepton and the single lepton channels appropriate for the top quark search. We illustrate this with a detailed analysis of the $B$ background in these channels along with the signals at LHC energy using both parton level MC and ISAJET programs. "
"We give the general solution of the stationary problem of 2+1 dimensional gravity in presence of extended sources, also endowed with angular momentum. We solve explicitly the compact support property of the energy momentum tensor and we apply the results to the study of closed time-like curves. In the case of rotational symmetry we prove that the weak energy condition combined with the absence of closed time-like curves at space infinity prevents the existence of closed time-like curves everywhere in an open universe (conical space at infinity). "
"The unified constrained dynamics is formulated without making use of the Dirac splitting of constraint classes. The strengthened, completely--closed, version of the unified constraint algebra generating equations is given. The fundamental phase variable supercommutators are included into the unified algebra as well. The truncated generating operator is defined to be nilpotent in terms of which the Unitarizing Hamiltonian is constructed. "
"Affine Toda theories with imaginary couplings associate with any simple Lie algebra ${\bf g}$ generalisations of Sine Gordon theory which are likewise integrable and possess soliton solutions. The solitons are \lq\lq created"" by exponentials of quantities $\hat F^i(z)$ which lie in the untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebra ${\bf\hat g}$ and ad-diagonalise the principal Heisenberg subalgebra. When ${\bf g}$ is simply-laced and highest weight irreducible representations at level one are considered, $\hat F^i(z)$ can be expressed as a vertex operator whose square vanishes. This nilpotency property is extended to all highest weight representations of all affine untwisted Kac-Moody algebras in the sense that the highest non vanishing power becomes proportional to the level. As a consequence, the exponential series mentioned terminates and the soliton solutions have a relatively simple algebraic expression whose properties can be studied in a general way. This means that various physical properties of the soliton solutions can be directly related to the algebraic structure. For example, a classical version of Dorey's fusing rule follows from the operator product expansion of two $\hat F$'s, at least when ${\bf g}$ is simply laced. This adds to the list of resemblances of the solitons with respect to the particles which are the quantum excitations of the fields. "
"We develop a stochastic approach to a non de Sitter Universe in a gauge-invariant way and obtain a system of Langevin-type equations which may be considered to be renormalization group equations for the long wave parts of the scalar fields and metric. We investigate in detail the case of generalized power-law inflation that appears in the model of the deflationary exit from the inflationary stage. For this case the above system is simplified greatly, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation for the scalar field driving inflation, find its stationary solutions and solve the FP equation for a delta-function initial distribution of the field. "
"We generalize the stochastic approach to quasi-power-law inflationary Universes,obtain the corresponding Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations for the scalar field driving inflation and find stationary solutions to the above FP equation. "
"The random--anisotropy Blume--Emery--Griffiths model, which has been proposed to describe the critical behavior of $^3$He--$^4$He mixtures in a porous medium, is studied in the pair approximation of the cluster variation method extended to disordered systems. Several new features, with respect to mean field theory, are found, including a rich ground state, a nonzero percolation threshold, a reentrant coexistence curve and a miscibility gap on the high $^3$He concentration side down to zero temperature. Furthermore, nearest neighbor correlations are introduced in the random distribution of the anisotropy, which are shown to be responsible for the raising of the critical temperature with respect to the pure and uncorrelated random cases and contribute to the detachment of the coexistence curve from the $\lambda$ line. "
"We address the question of whether anisotropic superconductivity is compatible with the evidently weak sensitivity of the critical temperature Tc to sample quality in the high-Tc copper oxides. We examine this issue quantitatively by solving the strong-coupling Eliashberg equations numerically as well as analytically for s-wave impurity scattering within the second Born approximation. For pairing interactions with a characteristically low energy scale, we find an approximately universal dependence of the d-wave superconducting transition temperature on the planar residual resistivity which is independent of the details of the microscopic pairing. These results, in conjunction with future systematic experiments, should help elucidate the symmetry of the order parameter in the cuprates. "
"Two integrals along the world trajectory of its curvature and torsion are added to the standard action for the point-like spinless relativistic particle. Since here the three-dimensional space-time is considered at the beginning, the torsion of the world curve is defined with a sign in contrast to the previous consideration: V. V. Nesterenko, J. Math. Phys. 32, 3315 (1991). Upon obtaining a complete set of constraints in the phase space a generalized Hamiltonian description of a new version of the model is constructed. This enables one to quantize the model canonically and to derive exactly the relation between the spin and mass of the states. "
"We consider the N to infinity limits of the N-state chiral Potts model. We find new weights that satisfy the star-triangle relations with spin variables either taking all the integer values or having values from a continous interval. The models provide chiral generalizations of Zamolodchikov's Fishnet Model. (For the more complete version, see math.QA/9906029, where the misprints in eq. (12) are also corrected.) "
"Kaplan recently proposed a novel lattice chiral gauge theory in which the bare theory is defined on $(2n+1)$-dimensions, but the continuum theory emerges in $2n$-dimensions. We explore whether the resulting theory reproduces all the features of continuum chiral gauge theory in the case of two-dimensional axial Schwinger model. We find that one can arrange for the two-dimensional perturbation expansion to be reproduced successfully. However, the theory fails to reproduce the 2-dimensional fermion nonconservation. "
"We point out that heavy fermion production through the fusion of the longitudinal gauge bosons might be relevant in probing the strongly interacting symmetry breaking sector of the electroweak interactions, by showing the dependence of the one loop amplititude for ($ w^{+} w^{-} \rightarrow \overline{t} t $) on the symmetry breaking mechanism. The one loop amplitude for ($ w^{+} w^{-} \rightarrow \overline{t} t $) is calculated for the standard model and extended technicolour theory. Techni-rho meson exchange is also briefly discussed. We find at $m_{t} = 150 ~GeV$ the cross section of top pair production in $ e^{+} e^{-}$ collisions is comparable in order of magnitude to that of the longitudinal gauge boson scattering. "
"For the quark-gluon plasma, an energy-momentum tensor is found corresponding to the high-temperature Braaten-Pisarski effective action. The tensor is found by considering the interaction of the plasma with a weak gravitational field and the positivity of the energy is studied. In addition, the complete effective action in curved spacetime is written down. "
"To overcome the difficulties with the energy indefiniteness in field theories with higher derivatives, it is supposed to use the mechanical analogy, the Timoshenko theory of the transverse flexural vibrations of beams or rods well known in mechanical engineering. It enables one to introduce the notion of a ""mechanical"" energy in such field models that is wittingly positive definite. This approach can be applied at least to the higher derivative models which effectively describe the extended localized solutions in usual first order field theories (vortex solutions in Higgs models and so on). Any problems with a negative norm ghost states and unitarity violation do not arise here. "
"We consider a BRST approach to G/H coset WZNW models, {\it i.e.} a formulation in which the coset is defined by a BRST condition. We will give the precise ingrediences needed for this formulation. Then we will prove the equivalence of this approach to the conventional coset formulation by solving the the BRST cohomology. This will reveal a remarkable connection between integrable representations and a class of non-integrable representations for negative levels. The latter representations are also connected to string theories based on non-compact WZNW models. The partition functions of G/H cosets are also considered. The BRST approach enables a covariant construction of these, which does not rely on the decomposition of G as $G/H\times H$. We show that for the well-studied examples of $SU(2)_k \times SU(2)_1/SU(2)_{k+1}$ and $SU(2)_k/U(1)$, we exactly reproduce the previously known results. "
"We use Chen iterated line integrals to construct a topological algebra ${\cal A}_p$ of separating functions on the {\it Group of Loops} ${\bf L}{\cal M}_p$. ${\cal A}_p$ has an Hopf algebra structure which allows the construction of a group structure on its spectrum. We call this topological group, the group of generalized loops $\widetilde {{\bf L}{\cal M}_p}$. Then we develope a {\it Loop Calculus}, based on the {\it Endpoint} and {\it Area Derivative Operators}, providing a rigorous mathematical treatment of early heuristic ideas of Gambini, Trias and also Mandelstam, Makeenko and Migdal. Finally we define a natural action of the ""pointed"" diffeomorphism group $Diff_p({\cal M})$ on $ \widetilde {{\bf L}{\cal M}_p}$, and consider a {\it Variational Derivative} which allows the construction of homotopy invariants. This formalism is useful to construct a mathematical theory of {\it Loop Representation} of Gauge Theories and Quantum Gravity. Figures available by request. "
The discussions on the modular invariance in section 5 are refined. 
"In a four dimensional theory of gravity with lagrangian quadratic in curvature and torsion, we compute the effective action for metrics of the form $g_{\mu\nu}=\rho^2\delta_{\mu\nu}$, with $\rho$ constant. Using standard field-theoretic methods we find that one loop quantum effects produce a nontrivial effective potential for $\rho$. We explain this unexpected result by showing how our regularization procedure differs from the one that is usually adopted in Quantum Gravity. Using the method of the average effective potential, we compute the scale dependence of the v.e.v. of the conformal factor. "
"A higher dimensional analogue of the KP hierarchy is presented. Fundamental constituents of the theory are pseudo-differential operators with Moyal algebraic coefficients. The new hierarchy can be interpreted as large-$N$ limit of multi-component ($\gl(N)$ symmetric) KP hierarchies. Actually, two different hierarchies are constructed. The first hierarchy consists of commuting flows and may be thought of as a straightforward extension of the ordinary and multi-component KP hierarchies. The second one is a hierarchy of noncommuting flows, and related to Moyal algebraic deformations of selfdual gravity. Both hierarchies turn out to possess quasi-classical limit, replacing Moyal algebraic structures by Poisson algebraic structures. The language of W-infinity algebras provides a unified point of view to these results. "
"In this work, we study the wavefunctions of the one dimensional $1/r$ Hubbard model in the strong interaction limit $U =\infty$. A set of Gutzwiller-Jastorw wavefunctions are shown to be eigen-functions of the Hamiltonian. The entire excitation spectrum and the thermodynamics are also studied in terms of more generalized Jastrow wavefunctions. For the wavefunctions and integrability conditions at finite on-site energy, further investigations are needed. "
"We consider systems of particles hopping stochastically on $d$-dimensional lattices with space-dependent probabilities. We map the master equation onto an evolution equation in a Fock space where the dynamics are given by a quantum Hamiltonian (continuous time) or a transfer matrix resp. (discrete time). We show that under certain conditions the time-dependent two-point density correlation function in the $N$-particle steady state can be computed from the probability distribution of a single particle moving in the same environment. Focussing on exclusion models where each lattice site can be occupied by at most one particle we discuss as an example for such a stochastic process a generalized Heisenberg antiferromagnet where the strength of the spin-spin coupling is space-dependent. In discrete time one obtains for one-dimensional systems the diagonal-to-diagonal transfer matrix of the two-dimensional six-vertex model with space-dependent vertex weights. For a random distribution of the vertex weights one obtains a version of the random barrier model describing diffusion of particles in disordered media. We derive exact expressions for the averaged two-point density correlation functions in the presence of weak, correlated disorder. "
"In this work we introduce one dimensional multi-component Hubbard model of 1/r hopping and U on-site energy. The wavefunctions, the spectrum and the thermodynamics are studied for this model in the strong interaction limit $U=\infty$. In this limit, the system is a special example of $SU(N)$ Luttinger liquids, exhibiting spin-charge separation in the full Hilbert space. Speculations on the physical properties of the model at finite on-site energy are also discussed. "
"We introduce a new class of cellular automata to model reaction-diffusion systems in a quantitatively correct way. The construction of the CA from the reaction-diffusion equation relies on a moving average procedure to implement diffusion, and a probabilistic table-lookup for the reactive part. The applicability of the new CA is demonstrated using the Ginzburg-Landau equation. "
"Recently, a class of solvable interaction round the face lattice models (IRF) were constructed for an arbitrary rational conformal field theory (RCFT) and an arbitrary field in it. The Boltzmann weights of the lattice models are related in the extreme ultra violet limit to the braiding matrices of the rational conformal field theory. In this note we use these new lattice models to construct a link invariant for any such pair of an RCFT and a field in it. Using the properties of RCFT and the IRF lattice models, we prove that the invariants so constructed always obey the Markov properties, and thus are true link invariants. Further, all the known link invariants, such as the Jones, HOMFLY and Kauffman polynomials arise in this way, along with giving a host of new invariants, and thus also a unified approach to link polynomials. It is speculated that all link invariants arise from some RCFT, and thus the problem of classifying link and knot invariants is equivalent to that of classifying two dimensional conformal field theory. "
"We study the BRST cohomology for $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ coset model, which describes an exact string black hole solution. It is shown that the physical spectrum could contain not only the extra discrete states corresponding to those in $c=1$ two-dimensional gravity but also many additional new states with ghost number $N_{FP}= -1 \sim 2$. We also discuss characters for nonunitary representations and the relation of our results to other approaches. "
"Representations of Quantum Groups U_q (g_n), g_n any semi simple Lie algebra of rank n, are constructed from arbitrary representations of rank n-1 quantum groups for q a root of unity. Representations which have the maximal dimension and number of free parameters for irreducible representations arise as special cases. "
"The transparent way for the invariant (Hamiltonian) description of equivariant localization of the integrals over phase space is proposed. It uses the odd symplectic structure, constructed over tangent bundle of the phase space and permits straightforward generalization for the path integrals. Simultaneously the method of supersymmetrization for a wide class of the Hamiltonian systems is derived. "
This paper is devoted to a proof of a generalized Ray-Singer conjecture for a manifold with boundary (the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary conditions are independently given on each connected component of the boundary and the transmission boundary condition is given on the interior boundary). The Ray-Singer conjecture \cite{RS} claims that for a closed manifold the combinatorial and the analytic torsion norms on the determinant of the cohomology are equal. For a manifold with boundary the ratio between the analytic torsion and the combinatorial torsion is computed. Some new general properties of the Ray-Singer analytic torsion are found. The proof does~not use any computation of eigenvalues and its asymptotic expansions or explicit expressions for the analytic torsions of any special classes of manifolds. 
"In this paper we give explicit formulae in momentum and coordinate space for the three-nucleon potentials due to $\rho$ and $\pi$ meson exchange, derived from off-mass-shell meson-nucleon scattering amplitudes which are constrained by the symmetries of QCD and by the experimental data. Those potentials have already been applied to nuclear matter calculations. Here we display additional terms which appear to be the most important for nuclear structure. The potentials are decomposed in a way that separates the contributions of different physical mechanisms involved in the meson-nucleon amplitudes. The same type of decomposition is presented for the $\pi - \pi$ TM force: the $\Delta$, the chiral symmetry breaking and the nucleon pair terms are isolated. "
"Target space duality (T duality), which interchanges Kaluza--Klein and winding-mode excitations of the compactified heterotic string, is realized as a symmetry of a world-sheet action. Axion-dilaton duality (S duality), a conjectured nonperturbative SL(2,Z) symmetry of the same theory, plays an analogous role for five-branes. We describe a soliton spectrum possessing both duality symmetries and argue that the theory has an infinite number of dual string descriptions. "
"We derive a Bjorken sum rule for semileptonic $\Omega_b$ decays to ground and low-lying negative-parity excited charmed baryon states, in the heavy quark limit. We discuss the restriction from this sum rule on form factors and compare it with some models. "
In the present paper we construct all typical finite-dimensional representations of the quantum Lie superalgebra $U_{q}[gl(2/2)]$ at generic deformation parameter $q$. As in the non-deformed case the finite-dimensional $U_{q}[gl(2/2)]$-module $W^{q}$ obtained is irreducible and can be decomposed into finite-dimensional irreducible $U_{q}[gl(2)\oplus gl(2)]$-submodules $V^{q}_{k}$ 
"A new version of quantum Miura transformation on the lattice is proposed, based on the lattice Kac-Moody algebra. A possibility of existence of the Sugawara construction on the lattice is discussed. "
"We calculate the form factors for the heavy-to-light transitions $B\rightarrow \pi,K $ by means of QCD sum rules using $\pi$ and $K$ light-cone wave functions. Higher twist contributions as well as gluonic corrections are taken into account. The sensitivity to the shape of the leading-twist wave functions and effects of SU(3)-breaking are discussed. The results are compared with quark model predictions and with the results from QCD sum rules for three-point correlators. "
"Low-energy supersymmetry is a theoretical extension of the Standard Model of particle physics in which supersymmetry is invoked to explain the origin of the electroweak scale. In this approach, the energy scale of supersymmetry breaking can be no larger than about 1 TeV. In these lectures, a pedagogical account of softly broken supersymmetric gauge theories is presented. The minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) is defined and constraints on its parameters are explored. The implications of supersymmetric tree-level interactions and its one-loop corrections are discussed. Low-energy supersymmetric model alternatives to the MSSM are briefly mentioned. "
We study ten-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills model with the space of extra dimensions being a non-symmetric homogeneous space with the invariant metric parametrized by two scales. Dimensional reduction of the model is carried out and the scalar potential of the reduced theory is calculated. In a cosmological setting minima of the potential in the radiation-dominated period that followed the inflation are found and their stability is analyzed. The compactifying solution is shown to be stable for the appropriate values of parameters. 
"We discuss gauge transformations in QED coupled to a charged spinor field, and examine whether we can gauge-transform the entire formulation of the theory from one gauge to another, so that not only the gauge and spinor fields, but also the forms of the operator-valued Hamiltonians are transformed. The discussion includes the covariant gauge, in which the gauge condition and Gauss's law are not primary constraints on operator-valued quantities; it also includes the Coulomb gauge, and the spatial axial gauge, in which the constraints are imposed on operator-valued fields by applying the Dirac-Bergmann procedure. We show how to transform the covariant, Coulomb and spatial axial gauges to what we call ``common form,'' in which all particle excitation modes have identical properties. We also show that, once that common form has been reached, QED in different gauges has a common time-evolution operator that defines time-translation for states that represent systems of electrons and photons. By combining gauge transformations with changes of representation from standard to common form, the entire apparatus of a gauge theory can be transformed from one gauge to another. "
"We consider a pair of coupled non-linear partial differential equations describing a biochemical model system. The Weiss-algorithm for the Painle\'{e} test, that has been succesfully used in mathematical physics for the KdV-equation, Burgers equation, the sine-Gordon equation etc., is applied, and we find that the system possesses only the ""conditional"" Painlev\'{e} property. We use the outcome of the analysis to construct an auto-B\""{a}cklund transformation, and we find a variety of one and two-parameter families of special solutions. "
"Point-to-point vacuum correlation functions for spatially separated hadron currents are calculated in quenched lattice QCD on a $16^3\times 24$ lattice with $6/g^2=5.7$. The lattice data are analyzed in terms of dispersion relations, which enable us to extract physical information from small distances where asymptotic freedom is apparent to large distances where the hadronic resonances dominate. In the pseudoscalar, vector, and axial vector channels where experimental data or phenomenological information are available, semi-quantitative agreement is obtained. In the nucleon and delta channels, where no experimental data exist, our lattice data complement experiments. Comparison with approximations based on sum rules and interacting instantons are made, and technical details of the lattice calculation are described. "
We study bosons interacting with an abelian Chern-Simons field on Riemann surfaces of genus $g>0$. It is shown that a singular gauge transformation brings the hamiltonian to free form. The transformed wave functions furnish a multi-component representation of the braid group studied by Imbo and March-Russell. The construction constitutes a proof of the equivalence of bosons coupled to a Chern-Simons field and anyons and generalizes the well known equivalence of the two pictures on the plane. 
"We calculate the free energy of SU(N) gauge theories on the lattice, to three loops. Our result, combined with Monte Carlo data for the average plaquette, gives a more precise estimate of the gluonic condensate. "
We study integrals of motion and factorizable S-matrices in two-dimensional integrable field theory with boundary. We propose the ``boundary cross-unitarity equation'' which is the boundary analog of the cross-symmetry condition of the ``bulk'' S-matrix. We derive the boundary S-matrices for the Ising field theory with boundary magnetic field and for the boundary sine-Gordon model. 
"We have shown an example of semiclassical transition in \phi^4 model with positive coupling constant. This process describes a semiclassical transition between two coherent states with much smaller average number of particles in the initial state than in the final state. This transition is technically analogous to the one-instanton transition in the electroweak model. It is suppressed by the factor exp(-2S), where S is Lipatov instanton action. It could be important to the problem of calculation of amplitudes for multiparticle production in \phi^4-type models. "
"We study the quantum tunnelling of a very complex object of which only part is coupled to an external potential ( the potential barrier ). We treat this problem as the tunnelling of a particle (part of the system affected by the potential) coupled to a ``heat bath"" ( all of the remaining degrees of freedom ) from the point of view of the wavefunction of the whole system. We obtain an effective scattering equation for this wavefunction which resembles the integral equation for the wavefunction of the particle in the absence of the bath. We show that the effect of the interaction is to renormalize the mass and the potential of the problem and that these new parameters can be solely described in terms of the spectral function of the excitations of the system. "
"We calculate the Picard group, over the integers, of the Hilbert scheme of smooth, irreducible, non-degenerate curves of degree $d$and genus $g \geq 4$ in ${\Bbb P}^r$, in the case when $d \geq 2g+1 $ and $r \leq d-g$. We express the classes of the generators in terms of some ``natural'' divisor classes. "
"We study the interactions of non-abelian vortices in two spatial dimensions. These interactions have novel features, because the Aharonov-Bohm effect enables a pair of vortices to exchange quantum numbers. The cross section for vortex-vortex scattering is typically a multi-valued function of the scattering angle. There can be an exchange contribution to the vortex-vortex scattering amplitude that adds coherently with the direct amplitude, even if the two vortices have distinct quantum numbers. Thus two vortices can be ``indistinguishable'' even though they are not the same. "
"New development of the theory of Grothendieck polynomials, based on an exponential solution of the Yang-Baxter equation in the algebra of projectors are given. "
"We propose a generalization of Heisenberg picture quantum mechanics in which a Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics is formulated directly for dynamical systems on a manifold with non--commuting coordinates, which act as operators on an underlying Hilbert space. This is accomplished by defining the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian as the real part of a graded total trace over the underlying Hilbert space, permitting a consistent definition of the first variational derivative with respect to a general operator--valued coordinate. The Hamiltonian form of the equations is expressed in terms of a generalized bracket operation, which is conjectured to obey a Jacobi identity. The formalism permits the natural implementation of gauge invariance under operator--valued gauge transformations. When an operator Hamiltonian exists as well as a total trace Hamiltonian, as is generally the case in complex quantum mechanics, one can make an operator gauge transformation from the Heisenberg to the Schr\""odinger picture. When applied to complex quantum mechanical systems with one bosonic or fermionic degree of freedom, the formalism gives the usual operator equations of motion, with the canonical commutation relations emerging as constraints associated with the operator gauge invariance. More generally, our methods permit the formulation of quaternionic quantum field theories with operator--valued gauge invariance, in which we conjecture that the operator constraints act as a generalization of the usual canonical commutators. "
"Let ${\cal S}{\cal U}(r, L_0)$ denote the moduli space of semi stable vector bundles of rank $r$ and fixed determinant $L_0$ of degree $d$ on a smooth curve $C$ of genus $g \geq 3$. In this paper we describe the group of automorphisms of $ {\cal S}{\cal U}(r, L_0) $. The analogue of this result is carried out for the space ${\cal U}(r,d) $ of semi stable vector bundles of rark $r$ and degree $d$. As an application of the technics we use, we give in the appendix at the end of the paper a proof of the Torelli theorem for the moduli spaces ${\cal S}{\cal U}(r, L_0) $ for any rank $r$ and degree $d$. "
"Integral and differential mass formulae of 4-dimensional stationary and axisymmetric Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton systems are derived. The total mass (energy) of these systems are expressed in terms of other physical quantities such as electric charge of the black hole suitably modified due to the existence of the dilaton field. It is shown that when we vary slightly the fields (metric of the spacetime $g_{\mu\nu}$, $U(1)-$gauge potential $A_{\mu}$, and dilaton $\phi$) in such a way as they obey classical equations of motion, the variation of the dilaton does not contribute explicitly to the variation of the total mass, but contributes only through the variation of the electric charge of the black hole. "
"This work studies the appearance of a Haldane gap in quasi one-dimensional antiferromagnets in the long wavelength limit, via the nonlinear $\sigma$-model. The mapping from the three-dimensional, integer spin Heisenberg model to the nonlinear $\sigma$-model is explained, taking into account two antiferromagnetic couplings: one along the chain axis ($J$) and one along the perpendicular planes ($J_\bot$) of a cubic lattice. An implicit equation for the Haldane gap is derived, as a function of temperature and coupling ratio $J_\bot/J$. Solutions to these equations show the existence of a critical coupling ratio beyond which a gap exists only above a transition temperature $T_N$. The cut-off dependence of these results is discussed. "
We calculate in this article the transport coefficients which characterize the dynamics of solitons in quantum field theory using the methods of dissipative quantum systems. We show how the damping and diffusion coefficients of soliton-like excitations can be calculated using the integral functional formalism. The model obtained in this article has new features which cannot be obtained in the standard models of dissipation in quantum mechanics. 
"We present a QCD based interpretation of heavy quark fragmentation which utilizes the heavy quark mass expansion. By distinguishing between perturbative and non-perturbative QCD effects, we show how to reliably extract mass independent parameters characterizing the fragmentation function. Because these parameters are quark mass independent, this procedure should permit tests of heavy quark symmetry. Furthermore, we show that heavy quark mass corrections vanish at order $m^2/Q^2$ in QCD. There also exist higher twist corrections of order $\Lambda m/Q^2$ and ${\alpha_{QCD}\over\pi} {m^2\over Q^2} \ln (Q^2/m^2)$ which we relate to the leading twist fragmentation function. "
We present the results of a detailed study of the effects of $b$-tagging on the heavy top-quark signal and backgrounds for the modes of the di-lepton plus two high transverse energy jets at the Fermilab Tevatron. The general characteristics of the heavy top-quark signal events are also discussed so that a comparison can be made between $b$-tagging and imposing stringent kinematical cuts to eliminate backgrounds. 
Different aspects of the Verlinde and Verlinde relation between high-energy effective scattering in QCD and a two-dimensional sigma-model are discussed. Starting from a lattice version of the truncated 4-dimensional Yang-Mills action we derive an effective theory with non-trivial longitudinal dynamics which has a form of the lattice two-dimensional chiral field model with non-trivial boundary conditions. To get quantum corrections coming from non-trivial longitudinal dynamics to transversal high-energy effective action one has to solve the two-dimensional chiral field model with non-trivial boundary conditions. We do this within an approximation scheme which takes into account one-dimensional excitations. Contributions of the one-dimensional excitations to quantum corrections for the high-energy effective action are calculated in the large N limit using the character expansion method. 
"We investigate the critical behavior of the gauged NJL model (QED plus 4-fermion interaction) and the gauged Yukawa model by use of the inversion method. By calculating the gauge-invariant chiral condensate in the inversion method to the lowest order, we derive the critical line which separates the spontaneous chiral-symmetry breaking phase from the chiral symmetric one. The critical exponent for the chiral order parameter associated with the second order chiral phase transition is shown to take the mean-field value together with possible logarithmic correction to the mean-field prediction. All the above results are gauge-parameter independent and are compared with the previous results obtained from the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion propagator. "
"I corrected 3 mistakes from the first version: that were an omitted Feynman integration in the function f^3_{ij}, a factor of 2 in front of log f^3_{ij} in eq.2 and an overall factor of 2 in Fig.1 c). The final result is changed drastically. Doing an expansion in the Higgs mass I show that the matrix element is identically 0 in the order (MZ/MH)^2, which is due to gauge invariance. Left with an amplitude of the order (MZ/MH)^4 the final result is that the scalar contribution to this decay rate is several orders of magnitude smaller than those of the W boson and fermions. "
"Recent renormalization group studies of impurities in spin-1/2 chains appear to be inconsistent with Bethe ansatz results for a special integrable model. We study this system in more detail around the integrable point in parameter space and argue that this integrable impurity model corresponds to a non-generic multi-critical point. Using previous results on impurities in half-integer spin chains, a consistent renormalization group flow and phase diagram is proposed. "
"Grand unified theories often predict unification of Yukawa couplings (e.g., $h_{b} = h_{\tau}$), and thus certain relations among fermion masses. The latter can distinguish these from models that predict only coupling constant unification. The implications of Yukawa couplings of the heavy-family in the supersymmetric extension of the standard model (when embedded in a GUT) are discussed. In particular, uncertainties associated with $m_{t}$ and $m_{b}$, threshold corrections at the low-scale, and threshold and nonrenormalizable-operator corrections associated with a grand-unified sector at the high-scale are parametrized and estimated. The implication of these and of the correlation between $m_{t}$ and the prediction for $\alpha_{s}$ are discussed. Constraints on the $\tan\beta$ range in such models and an upper bound on the $t$-quark pole mass are given and are shown to be affected by the $\alpha_{s}-m_{t}$ correlation. Constraints on the low-scale thresholds are found to be weakened by uncertainties associated with the high-scale. "
"Supersymmetry may be discovered at hadron colliders by searching for events similar to the top quark signal of two isolated leptons. In the case of gluino production, the most distinguishing feature is that in half the events the two leading leptons have the same sign. We demonstrate the remarkable sensitivity of this gluino signature at both the Fermilab Tevatron Collider and at the Superconducting Super Collider. Techniques for approximately determining the gluino mass are discussed. "
"We consider the experimental properties of superconductors with a gap which is an odd function of energy $\bepsk=\epsk - \mu$, i.e.\ , a gap which vanishes everywhere on the Fermi surface; this is done within a in a BCS framework. Apart from the standard phenomenology (density of states, penetration depth, NMR, $C_V(T)$, $B_{c2}(T)$), we also look at the stability of the superconducting state. It is stable to finite supercurrents (although with a normal fluid density which increases with the supercurrent density), and is also very weakly affected by non-magnetic impurities. We find two classes of odd-gap superconductors, which strongly differ in their low-energy properties. For a certain parameter range, most of the results resemble those for d-wave superconductors (except for the effect of impurities). "
"Wormhole boundary conditions for the Wheeler--DeWitt equation can be derived from the path integral formulation. It is proposed that the wormhole wave function must be square integrable in the maximal analytic extension of minisuperspace. Quantum wormholes can be invested with a Hilbert space structure, the inner product being naturally induced by the minisuperspace metric, in which the Wheeler--DeWitt operator is essentially self--adjoint. This provides us with a kind of probabilistic interpretation. In particular, giant wormholes will give extremely small contributions to any wormhole state. We also study the whole spectrum of the Wheeler--DeWitt operator and its role in the calculation of Green's functions and effective low energy interactions. "
"The NGT field equations with sources are expanded first about a flat Minkowski background and then about a GR background to first-order in the antisymmetric part of the fundamental tensor, $g_{\mu\nu}$. From the general, static spherically symmetric solution of the field equation in empty space, we establish that there are two conserved charges $m$ and $\ell^2$ corresponding to the two basic gauge invariances of NGT. There is no direct contribution to the flux of gravitational waves from the antisymmetric, $g_{[\mu\nu]}$, sector in the linearized, lowest order of approximation, nor in the non-linear theory. It is demonstrated that the flux of gravitational waves is finite in magnitude and positive definite for solutions of the field equations which satisfy the boundary condition of asymptotic flatness. "
"We propose a graded classification of the entire field of multivector physics, including all alternative points of view. The (often tacit) postulates of different types of formulations are contrasted, summarizing their consequences. Specifically, spin-gauge formulations of gravitation and GUT which assume standard column spinors will require unnecessarily large matrix algebras. An extreme generalization is introduced, where wavefunctions are multivectors, in which multiple generations of particles naturally appear without resorting to increasing the size of the algebra. Further, this allows for two-sided (bilateral) operators, which can accomodate in excess of 10 times more gauge fields without increasing the algebraic representation. As this generalization encompasses all the essential features of the other categories, it is proposed to be the best path to new physics. [Summary of talk at 3rd International Conf on Clifford Algebras and Their Appl. in Physics, Deinze, Belgium May 1993]. "
"Induced soft gluon bremsstrahlung associated with multiple collisions is calculated via perturbative QCD. We derive the non-abelian analog of the Landau-Pomeranchuk effect that suppresses induced soft radiation with formation times exceeding the mean free path, $\lambda$. The dependence of the suppression effect on the $SU(N)$ representation of the jet parton as well as the kinematic variables is expressed through a radiation formation factor. Unlike in QED, the finite contribution from the small $x$ regime in QCD leads to an approximately constant radiative energy loss per unit length, $dE/dz\propto \mu^2$, in the high energy limit that is sensitive to the infrared screening scale, $\mu$, of the medium. As a function of the dimensionless parameter $\zeta=\lambda \mu^2/E$, we show furthermore how the energy dependence of $dE/dz$ evolves from the above constant for $\zeta\ll 1$ to the more familiar (Bethe-Heitler) linear dependence for $\zeta \gg 1$. "
"We calculate the electric screening mass in hot hadronic matter using two different approaches, chiral perturbation theory and the relativistic virial expansion with empirical phase shifts, and compare the results to each other and to a gas of free pions and $\rho$ mesons. We also compute the electric screening mass for noninteracting, charged bosons with mass $m$ on a lattice to study likely finite size effects in lattice gauge theory simulations of continuum QCD. For a lattice of given size, the continuum can be properly represented only for a window in the ratio $T/m$. "
"The 2D lattice gauge theory with a quantum gauge group $SL_q(2)$ is considered. When $q=e^{i\frac{2\pi}{k+2}}$, its weak coupling partition function coincides with the one of the G/G coset model ({\em i.e.} equals the Verlinde numbers). However, despite such a remarkable coincidence, these models are not equivalent but, in some certain sense, dual to each other. "
"In the Majoron models the $SU(2)$ doublet Higgs can decay invisibly into a Majoron pair via its mixing with a singlet. An analysis of the LEP data shows the invisible decay mode to be more visible than the SM decay. For these models, the dominantly doublet Higgs $H$ is shown to have a mass limit within $\pm 6$ GeV of the SM limit irrespective of the model parameters. But the dominantly singlet one $S$ can be arbitrarily light for sufficiently small mixing angle. "
"We study the $NN$ phaseshifts in a Hamiltonian obtained from quantization of the collective modes in the Skyrme model. We show that a combination of an adiabatic and diabatic approximation gives a good $NN$ force, with sufficient attraction to produce a bound deuteron. The description of the repulsive core appears to be the main cause for the remaining discrepancies between the Skyrme model force and phenomenology. Finally we discuss the possibility of finding non-strange dibaryon resonances in the $J^\pi=3^+$ channel. "
"The general relationship between a Retarded-Advanced Green function of the Real Time formalism and analytical continuations of the Imaginary Time Amplitude is obtained via perturbation theory. A 4-point R-A function is, at most, a linear combination of three analytical continuations, and a 5-point R-A function of seven continuations. The R-A functions are written as the sum of one analytical continuation plus discontinuities across single momentum transfer variables. These discontinuities "
"We study $2d$ QCD coupled to fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge group $SU(N)$ at large $N$, and its relation to string theory. It is shown that the model undergoes a deconfinement transition at a finite temperature (analogous to the Hagedorn transition in string theory), with certain winding modes in the Euclidean time direction turning tachyonic at high temperature. The theory is supersymmetric for a certain ratio of quark mass and gauge coupling. For other values of that ratio, supersymmetry is softly broken. The spectrum of bound states contains an infinite number of approximately linear Regge trajectories, approaching at large mass $M$, $\alpha^\prime M^2=\sum_i i l_i$ $(l_i\in{\bf Z_+})$. Thus, the theory exhibits an exponentially growing density of bosonic and fermionic states at high energy. We discuss these results in light of string expectations. "
"Following recent work of Halperin, Lee, and Read, and Kalmeyer and Zhang, a double-layer electron system with total Landau-level filling factor $\nu=1/2$ is mapped onto an equivalent system of fermions in zero average magnetic field interacting via a Chern-Simons gauge field. Within the random-phase approximation a new, low-lying, diffusive mode, not present in the $\nu=1/2$ single-layer system, is found. This mode leads to more singular low-energy scattering than appears in the single layer system, and to an attractive pairing interaction between fermions in different layers which grows stronger as the layer spacing is decreased. The possible connection between this pairing interaction and the experimentally observed fractional quantum Hall effect in double-layer systems is discussed. "
We derive new bounds on the b-number form factor $F(q^2)$ of the B meson. (Revised version of hep-ph/9306214). 
"Our goal is to discover possible new 4-dimensional euclidean solutions (instantons) in fundamental SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory, with a constraint added to prevent collapse of the scale. We show that, most likely, there exists one particular new constrained instanton (\Istar) with vanishing Pontryagin index. This is based on a topological argument that involves the construction of a non-contractible loop of 4-dimensional configurations with a certain upperbound on the action, which we establish numerically. We expect \Istar to be the lowest action non-trivial solution in the vacuum sector of the theory. There also exists a related static, but unstable, solution, the new sphaleron \Sstar. Possible applications of \Istar to the electroweak interactions include the asymptotics of perturbation theory and the high-energy behaviour of the total cross-section. "
"Neural network models offer a theoretical testbed for the study of learning at the cellular level. The only experimentally verified learning rule, Hebb's rule, is extremely limited in its ability to train networks to perform complex tasks. An identified cellular mechanism responsible for Hebbian-type long-term potentiation, the NMDA receptor, is highly versatile. Its function and efficacy are modulated by a wide variety of compounds and conditions and are likely to be directed by non-local phenomena. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that NMDA receptors are not essential for some types of learning. We have shown that another neural network learning rule, the chemotaxis algorithm, is theoretically much more powerful than Hebb's rule and is consistent with experimental data. A biased random-walk in synaptic weight space is a learning rule immanent in nervous activity and may account for some types of learning -- notably the acquisition of skilled movement. "
"We propose a unified magnetic phase diagram of cuprate superconductors. A new feature of this phase diagram is a broad intermediate doping region of quantum-critical, $z=1$, behavior, characterized by temperature independent $T_1T/T_{\rm 2G}$ and linear $T_1T$, where the spin waves are not completely absorbed by the electron-hole continuum. The spin gap in the moderately doped materials is related to the suppression of the low-energy spectral weight in the quantum disordered, $z=1$, regime. The crossover to the $z=2$ regime, where $T_1T/T_{\rm 2G}^2 \simeq \mbox{const}$, occurs only in the fully doped materials. "
"We examine the decoherence properties of a quantum open system as modeled by a quantum optical system in the Markov regime. We look for decoherence in both the Environment Induced Superselection (EIS) and Consistent Histories (CH) frameworks. We propose a general measure of the coherence of the reduced density matrix and find that EIS decoherence occurs in a number of bases for this model. The degree of ``diagonality'' achieved increases with bath temperature. We evaluate the Decoherence Functional of Consistent Histories for coarse grained phase space two-time projected histories. Using the measures proposed by Dowker and Halliwell we find that the consistency of the histories improves with increasing bath temperature, time and final grain size and decreases with initial grain size. The peaking increases with increasing grain size and decreases with increasing bath temperature. Adopting the above proposed measure of ``coherence'' to the Decoherence Functional gives similar results. The results agree in general with expectations while the anomalous dependence of the consistency on the initial grain size is discussed. "
"We consider the most general solar model, using the neutrino fluxes as free parameters constrained only by the solar luminosity, and show that the combined solar neutrino data exclude any astrophysical solution at 98\% C.L.\ Our best fit to the $^7$Be and $^8$B fluxes is respectively $<$7\% and 37$\pm$4\% of the standard solar model prediction, but only with a large $\chi^2$ (5.6 for 1 d.f.). This best fit to the fluxes contradicts explicit nonstandard solar models, which generally reduce the $^8$B flux more than the $^7$Be. Those models are well parameterized by a single parameter, the central temperature. "
"Recent developments in unifying treatment of domain wall configurations and their global space-time structure is presented. Domain walls between vacua of non-equal cosmological constant fall in three classes depending on the value of their energy density $\sigma$: (i) extreme walls with $\sigma=\sigma_{ext}$ are planar, static walls corresponding to the supersymmetric configurations, (ii) non-extreme walls with $\sigma>\sigma_{ext}$ are expanding bubbles with two insides, (iii) ultra-extreme walls with $\sigma<\sigma_{ext}$ are bubbles of false vacuum decay. As a prototype exhibiting all three types of configurations vacuum walls between Minkowski and anti-deSitter vacua are discussed. Space-times associated with these walls exhibit non-trivial causal structure closely related to the one of the corresponding extreme and non-extreme charged black holes, however, without singularities. Recently discovered extreme dilatonic walls, pertinent to string theory, are also addressed. They are static, planar domain walls with metric in the string frame being {\it flat} everywhere. Intriguing similarities between the global space-time of dilatonic walls and that of charged dilatonic black holes are pointed out. "
"Local and global gravitational effects induced by eternal vacuum domain walls are studied. We concentrate on thin walls between non-equal and non-positive cosmological constants on each side of the wall. These vacuum domain walls fall in three classes depending on the value of their energy density $\sigma$: (1)\ extreme walls with $\sigma = \sigma_{{\text{ext}}}$ are planar, static walls corresponding to supersymmetric configurations, (2)\ non-extreme walls with $\sigma = \sigma_{{\text{non}}} > \sigma_{{\text{ext}}}$ correspond to expanding bubbles with observers on either side of the wall being {\em inside\/} the bubble, and (3)\ ultra-extreme walls with $\sigma = \sigma_{{\text{ultra}}} < \sigma_{{\text{ext}}}$ represent the bubbles of false vacuum decay. On the sides with less negative cosmological constant, the extreme, non-extreme, and ultra-extreme walls exhibit no, repulsive, and attractive effective ``gravitational forces,'' respectively. These ``gravitational forces'' are global effects not caused by local curvature. Since the non-extreme wall encloses observers on both sides, the supersymmetric system has the lowest gravitational mass accessable to outside observers. It is conjectured that similar positive mass protection occurs in all physical systems and that no finite negative mass object can exist inside the universe. We also discuss the global space-time structure of these singularity free space-times and point out intriguing analogies with the causal structure of black holes. "
"We investigate the role of cosmic rays from young galaxies in heating and ionizing the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshift. Using the IRAS observations at $60 \mu m$, we estimate the cosmic ray luminosity density at the present epoch. We consider various forms of luminosity evolution in redshift and calculate (a) the thresholds corresponding to the upper limits of Gunn-Peterson optical depth, (b) the Compton $y$ parameter for an IGM heated by cosmic rays and compare with the upper limits from COBE measurements and (c) an estimated limit from the integral of metal enrichment. We show that certain models, with rather strong evolution and early formation of galaxies, allow reionization of the IGM, consistent with all known constraints. "
"Following my previous proposal that two-particle correlation functions can be used to resolve the minijet contribution to particle production in minimum biased events of high energy hadronic interactions, I study the $p_T$ and energy dependence of the correlation. Using HIJING Monte Carlo model, it is found that the correlation $c(\phi_1,\phi_2)$ in azimuthal angle $\phi$ between two particles with $p_T>p_T^{cut}$ resembles much like two back-to-back jets as $p_T^{cut}$ increases at high colliding energies due to minijet production. It is shown that $c(0,0)-c(0,\pi)$, which is related to the relative fraction of particles from minijets, increases with energy. The background of the correlation for fixed $p_T^{cut}$ also grows with energy due to the increase of multiple minijet production. Application of this analysis to the study of jet quenching in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is also discussed. "
"We give the Heisenberg realization for the quantum algebra $U_q(sl_n)$, which is written by the $q$-difference operator on the flag manifold. We construct it from the action of $U_q(sl_n)$ on the $q$-symmetric algebra $A_q(Mat_n)$ by the Borel-Weil like approach. Our realization is applicable to the construction of the free field realization for the $U_q(\widehat{sl_n})$ [AOS]. "
"The relation between Geisteswissenschaft and Naturwissenschaft has been discussed by Munster in hep-th/9305104. The plan of this paper is to begin with the empty set; use it to form sets and quivers (sets of points plus sets of arrows between pairs of points); and then use them to make complex vector spaces and to get the A-D-E Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams. The Dn Spin(2n) Lie algebras have spinor representations to describe fermions. D4 Spin(8) triality gives automorphisms among its vector and two half-spinor representations. D5 Spin(10) contains both Spin(8) and the complexification of the vector representation of Spin(8). E6 contains both Spin(10) and the two half-spinor representations of Spin(10), and therefore contains the adjoint representation of Spin(8) and the complexifications of the vector and the two half-spinor representations of Spin(8). E6 is the basis for construction of a fundamental model of physics that is consistent with experiment (see hep-th/9302030, hep-ph/9301210). "
"Path integral techniques are used to understand the behaviour of a particle moving in a bistable potential well and acted upon by quasi-monochromatic external noise. In the limit of small diffusion coefficient, a steepest descent evaluation of the path integral enables mean first passage times and the transition times from one well to the other to be computed. The results and general approach are compared with computer simulations of the process. It is found that the bandwidth parameter, $\Gamma$, has a critical value above which particle escape is by white-noise-like outbursts, but below which escape is by oscillatory type behaviour. "
"We review recent results from studies of the dynamics of classical Yang-Mills fields on a lattice. We discuss the numerical techniques employed in solving the classical lattice Yang-Mills equations in real time, and present results exhibiting the universal chaotic behavior of nonabelian gauge theories. The complete spectrum of Lyapunov exponents is determined for the gauge group SU(2). We survey results obtained for the SU(3) gauge theory and other nonlinear field theories. We also discuss the relevance of these results to the problem of thermalization in gauge theories. "
"The status of coupling constant unification (with and without a unification of Yukawa couplings) is discussed. Uncertainties associated with the input coupling constants, $m_{b}$ and $m_{t}$, threshold corrections at the low and high scale, and possible nonrenormalizable operators are described and a discrepancy between effective and physical scales is pointed out. Theoretical uncertainties in the predictions of $\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})$, $m_{b}$, and the unification scale, $M_{G}$, are discussed and estimated. Constraints on the super-partner spectrum are found to be weak if uncertainties associated with the high-scale are included. However, requiring $h_{b} = h_{\tau}$ at $M_{G}$ excludes $3 < \tan \beta < 40$ (for $m_{t} < 200$ GeV). "
"A generalization of the differential geometry of forms and vector fields to the case of quantum Lie algebras is given. In an abstract formulation that incorporates many existing examples of differential geometry on quantum groups, we combine an exterior derivative, inner derivations, Lie derivatives, forms and functions all into one big algebra. In particular we find a generalized Cartan identity that holds on the whole quantum universal enveloping algebra of the left-invariant vector fields and implicit commutation relations for a left-invariant basis of 1-forms. "
"We show that the connection between certain integrable perturbations of $N=2$ superconformal theories and graphs found by Lerche and Warner extends to a broader class. These perturbations are such that the generators of the perturbed chiral ring may be diagonalized in an orthonormal basis. This allows to define a dual ring, whose generators are labelled by the ground states of the theory and are encoded in a graph or set of graphs, that reproduce the pattern of the ground states and interpolating solitons. All known perturbations of the $ADE$ potentials and some others are shown to satisfy this criterion. This suggests a test of integrability. "
"An elastic anomaly, observed in the heavy fermi liquid state of Ce alloys (for example, CeCu$_6$ and CeTe), is analyzed by using the infinite-$U$ Anderson lattice model. The four atomic energy levels are assumed for f-electrons. Two of them are mutually degenerate. A small crystalline splitting $2\Delta$ is assumed between two energy levels. The fourfold degenerate conduction bands are also considered in the model. We solve the model using the mean field approximation to slave bosons, changing the Fermi energy in order to keep the total electron number constant. The nonzero value of the mean field of the slave bosons persists over the temperatures much higher than the Kondo temperature. This is the effect of the constant electron number. Next, the linear susceptibility with respect to $\Delta$ is calculated in order to obtain the renomalized elastic constant. The resulting temperature dependence of the constant shows the downward dip. We point out the relation of our finding with the experimental data. "
"A simple model of electron-vibron interactions in buckminsterfullerene ions is solved semiclassically. Electronic degeneracies of C$_{60}$$^{n-}$ induce dynamical Jahn-Teller distortions, which are unimodal for $n\!\ne\!3$ and bimodal for $n\!=\!3$. The quantization of motion along the Jahn-Teller manifold leads to a symmetric-top rotator Hamiltonian. I find Molecular Aharonov-Bohm effects where electronic Berry phases determine the vibrational spectra, zero point fluctuations, and electrons' pair binding energies. The latter are relevant to superconductivity in alkali-fullerenes. "
"The constrained Hamiltonian systems admitting no gauge conditions are considered. The methods to deal with such systems are discussed and developed. As a concrete application, the relationship between the Dirac and reduced phase space quantizations is investigated for spin models belonging to the class of systems under consideration. It is traced out that the two quantization methods may give similar, or essentially different physical results, and, moreover, a class of constrained systems, which can be quantized only by the Dirac method, is discussed. A possible interpretation of the gauge degrees of freedom is given. "
"The observation that $n$ pairs of para-Bose (pB) operators generate the universal enveloping algebra of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra $osp(1/2n)$ is used in order to define deformed pB operators. It is shown that these operators are an alternative to the Chevalley generators. On this background $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$, its ""Cartan-Weyl"" generators and their ""supercommutation"" relations are written down entirely in terms of deformed pB operators. An analog of the Poincare- Birkhoff-Witt theorem is formulated. "
": We examine again the problem of the damping rate of a moving heavy fermion in a hot plasma within the resummed perturbative theory of Pisarski and Braaten. The ansatz for its evaluation which relates it to the imaginary part of the fermion propagator pole in the framework of a self-consistent approach is critically analyzed. As already pointed out by various authors, the only way to define the rate is through additional implementation of magnetic screening. We show in detail how the ansatz works in this case and where we disagree with other authors. We conclude that the self-consistent approach is not satisfactory. "
"The deformed Poincar\'{e} group contains a characteristic mass, $\kappa$. At energies exceeding $\kappa$, deviations from the special theory of relativity become significant. However, small deviations from ordinary relativistic kinematics are observable even at energies substantially lower than $\kappa$. The observation of distant events producing ultra high energy (UHE) particles leads to a lower limit on $\kappa$. From an analysis of the UHE data on the burst in the binary system HER X1 in 1986, we deduce $\kappa > 1.3 10^{12}$~GeV. "
"We calculate elementary proton-proton and neutron-proton bremsstrahlung and their contribution to the $e^+e^-$ invariant mass distribution. At 4.9 GeV, the proton-proton contribution is larger than neutron-proton, but it is small compared to recent data. We then make a first calculation of bremsstrahlung in nucleon-nucleon reactions with multi-hadron final states. Again at 4.9 GeV, the many-body bremsstrahlung is larger than simple nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung by more than an order of magnitude in the low-mass region. When the bremsstrahlung contributions are summed with Dalitz decay of the $\eta$, radiative decay of the $\Delta$ and from two-pion annihilation, the result matches recent high statistics proton-proton data from the Dilepton Spectrometer collaboration. "
"We explore the use of bi-orthogonal basis for continuous wavelet transformations, thus relaxing the so-called admissibility condition on the analyzing wavelet. As an application, we determine the eigenvalues and corresponding radial eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of relativistic Hydrogen-like atoms. "
"An algorithm is described for the construction of actions for scalar, spinor, and vector gauge fields that remains well-defined when the metric is degenerate and that involve no contravariant tensor fields. These actions produce the standard matter dynamics and coupling to gravity when tetrad is nondegenerate, but have the property that all fields that appear in them can be pulled back through an arbitrary map of degree one and that this pull back leave the action invariant when the map has degree one. "
"We give the operadic formulation of (weak, strong) topological vertex algebras, which are variants of topological vertex operator algebras studied recently by Lian and Zuckerman. As an application, we obtain a conceptual and geometric construction of the Batalin-Vilkovisky algebraic structure (or the Gerstenhaber algebra structure) on the cohomology of a topological vertex algebra (or of a weak topological vertex algebra) by combining this operadic formulation with a theorem of Getzler (or of Cohen) which formulates Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras (or Gerstenhaber algebras) in terms of the homology of the framed little disk operad (or of the little disk operad). "
"Contrary to common belief, the requirement that supersymmetry exists and that there are two Higgs doublets and no singlet at the electroweak energy scale does not necessarily result in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). An interesting alternative is presented. "
"Hadronic axions with the decay constant $f_a\simeq 10^{6}$ GeV may fulfill all astrophysical and laboratory constraints discussed so far. In this paper, we reexamine the possibility of the hadronic axion window while taking into account the uncertainties of some parameters describing low energy axion dynamics. It is found that $f_a$ in the range from $3\times 10^5$ GeV to $3\times 10^6$ can not be excluded by existing arguments. We then examine the implication of this hadronic axion window for the big-bang nucleosynthesis (NS) by evaluating the energy density of thermal axions at the nucleosynthesis epoch. Our analysis yields $(\rho_a/\rho_{\nu})_{NS}=0.4\sim 0.5$ which exceeds slightly the current best bound $(\rho_a/\rho_{\nu})_{NS}\leq 0.3$. "
The structure of the hadronic final state in deep inelastic scattering at HERA is studied on the level of the Monte Carlo event generator. Special emphasis is given to the colour coherence phenomenon in the current fragmentation region. It is shown that results of perturbative QCD recently tested in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at LEP also describe production of hadrons in current fragmentation region of deep inelastic scattering. 
"We study baryon and diquark correlation functions in the framework of an instanton model for the QCD vacuum. The model naturally accomodates a light scalar diquark. As a consequence, the correlation functions for the nucleon and delta are found to be qualitatively different. Using a complete set of all available correlation functions we determine masses and coupling constants for these particles. We compare our results with predictions from QCD sum rules and recent lattice measurement of point-to-point correlators. "
Iterating renormalization group transformations for lattice fermions the Wilson action is driven to fixed points of the renormalization group. A line of fixed points is found and the fixed point actions are computed analytically. They are local and may be used to improve scaling in lattice QCD. The action at the line's endpoint is chirally invariant and still has no fermion doubling. The Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem is evaded because in this case the fixed point action is nonlocal. The use of this action for a construction of lattice chiral fermions is discussed. 
"The cosmological neutrino background will mediate long range forces between objects. For a background of temperature T, the potential decreases as 1/r^5 for r >> 1/T and as 1/r for r << 1/T. These forces have large spin-dependent components. If the neutrino background is nonrelativistic, the long range forces are enhanced by a factor of the inverse neutrino velocity. These long range forces may provide a method for observing the cosmological neutrino background. "
We consider the magnetic field dependence of the chemical potential for parabolically confined quantum dots in a strong magnetic field. Approximate expressions based on the notion that the size of a dot is determined by a competition between confinement and interaction energies are shown to be consistent with exact diagonalization studies for small quantum dots. Fine structure is present in the magnetic field dependence which cannot be explained without a full many-body description and is associated with ground-state level crossings as a function of confinement strength or Zeeman interaction strength. Some of this fine structure is associated with precursors of the bulk incompressible states responsible for the fractional quantum Hall effect. 
"We show that the formal moduli space of a Calabi-Yau manifold $X^n$ carries a linear structure, as predicted by mirror symmetry. This linear structure is canonically associated to a splitting of the Hodge filtration on $H^n(X)$. "
"We present a series of detailed band calculations on the various structural phases of doped lanthanum cuprate: HTT, LTO, and LTT. The LTO distortion is shown to have little effect on the electronic density of states (DOS). A fit to the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature indicates that only 2.5% of the DOS is affected by the HTT$\to$ LTO transition. The LTT distortion also has little effect on the DOS for the experimental value of the octahedral tilt angle. Larger tilt angles, though, lead to a dramatic change in the DOS. "
We give the explicite form of the BRST charge Q for the algebra W_4=WA_3 in the basis where the spin-3 and the spin-4 field are primary as well as for a basis where the algebra closes quadratically. 
"Ramanujan's series for Pi, that appeared in his famous letter to Hardy, is given a one-line WZ proof. "
"The cosmological features of primordial black holes formed from collapsed cosmic string loops are studied. Observational restrictions on a population of primordial black holes are used to restrict $f$, the fraction of cosmic string loops which collapse to form black holes, and $\mu$, the cosmic string mass-per-unit-length. Using a realistic model of cosmic strings, we find the strongest restriction on the parameters $f$ and $\mu$ is due to the energy density in $100 MeV$ photons radiated by the black holes. We also find that inert black hole remnants cannot serve as the dark matter. If earlier, crude estimates of $f$ are reliable, our results severely restrict $\mu$, and therefore limit the viability of the cosmic string large-scale structure scenario. "
Local and global properties of the moduli space of Calabi--Yau type compactifications determine the low energy parameters of the string effective action. We show that the moduli space geometry is entirely encoded in the Picard--Fuchs equations for the periods of the Calabi--Yau $H^{(3)}$--cohomology. 
"We study the dynamics of phase ordering of a non-conserved, scalar order parameter in one dimension, with long-range interactions characterized by a power law $r^{-d-\sigma}$. In contrast to higher dimensional systems, the point nature of the defects allows simpler analytic and numerical methods. We find that, at least for $\sigma > 1$, the model exhibits evolution to a self-similar state characterized by a length scale which grows with time as $t^{1/(1+\sigma)}$, and that the late time dynamics is independent of the initial length scale. The insensitivity of the dynamics to the initial conditions is consistent with the scenario of an attractive, non-trivial renormalization group fixed point which governs the late time behavior. For $\sigma \le 1$ we find indications in both the simulations and an analytic method that this behavior may be system size dependent. "
A chaotic system of a nonrelativistic superparticle moving freely on the super Riemann surface (SRS) of genus $g \geq 2$ is reviewed. 
"We calculate the one-loop perturbative correction to the coefficient of the \cs term in non-abelian gauge theory in the presence of Higgs fields, with a variety of symmetry-breaking structures. In the case of a residual $U(1)$ symmetry, radiative corrections do not change the coefficient of the \cs term. In the case of an unbroken non-abelian subgroup, the coefficient of the relevant \cs term (suitably normalized) attains an integral correction, as required for consistency of the quantum theory. Interestingly, this coefficient arises purely from the unbroken non-abelian sector in question; the orthogonal sector makes no contribution. This implies that the coefficient of the \cs term is a discontinuous function over the phase diagram of the theory. "
The phase structure of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with N-component fermions in curved space-time is studied in the leading order of the 1/N expansion. The effective potential for composite operator $\bar{\psi}\psi$ is calculated by using the normal coordinate expansion in the Schwinger proper-time method. The existence of the first-order phase transition caused by the change of the space-time curvature is confirmed and the dynamical mass of the fermion is calculated as a simultaneous function of the curvature and the four-fermion coupling constant. The phase diagram in the curvature and the coupling constant is obtained. 
"We extend our lagrangian technique for chiral perturbation theory for quenched QCD to include theories in which only some of the quarks are quenched. We discuss the relationship between the partially quenched theory and a theory in which only the unquenched quarks are present. We also investigate the peculiar infrared divergences associated with the $\eta'$ in the quenched approximation, and find the conditions under which such divergences can appear in a partially quenched theory. We then apply our results to staggered fermion QCD in which the square root of the fermion determinant is taken, using the observation that this should correspond to a theory with four quarks, two of which are quenched. [Uses harvmac macro package. No postscipt for the figures is available (sorry), but the figures are simple and we include do-it-yourself instructions for drawing them.] "
"Starting from the well-known quantum Miura transformation for the Lie algebra $A_n$, we compute explicitly the OPEs for $n=3$ and 4. The primary fields with spin 3, 4 and 5 are found (for general $n$). By using these primary fields and the OPEs from quantum Miura transformation, we derive the complete structure of the nonlinear $W_4$ and $W_5$ algebras. "
"We show that the isotropic harmonic oscillator in the ordinary euclidean space ${\bf R}^N$ ($N\ge 3$) admits a natural q-deformation into a new quantum mechanical model having a q-deformed symmetry (in the sense of quantum groups), $SO_q(N,{\bf R})$. The q-deformation is the consequence of replacing $ R^N$ by ${\bf R}^N_q$ (the corresponding quantum space). This provides an example of quantum mechanics on a noncommutative geometrical space. To reach the goal, we also have to deal with a sensible definition of integration over ${\bf R}^N_q$, which we use for the definition of the scalar product of states. "
"We study the surface magnetization of aperiodic Ising quantum chains. Using fermion techniques, exact results are obtained in the critical region for quasiperiodic sequences generated through an irrational number as well as for the automatic binary Thue-Morse sequence and its generalizations modulo p. The surface magnetization exponent keeps its Ising value, beta_s=1/2, for all the sequences studied. The critical amplitude of the surface magnetization depends on the strength of the modulation and also on the starting point of the chain along the aperiodic sequence. "
"We show that it is possible to realize an inflationary scenario even without conversion of the false vacuum energy to radiation. Such cosmological models have a deflationary stage in which $Ha^2$ is decreasing and radiation produced by particle creation in an expanding Universe becomes dominant. The preceding inflationary stage ends since the inflaton potential becomes steep. False vacuum energy is finally (partly) converted to the inflaton kinetic energy , the potential energy rapidly decreases and the Universe comes to the deflationary stage with a scale factor $a(t) \propto t^{1/3}$. Basic features and observational consequences of this scenario are indicated. "
"Let $(X,L)$ be a polarized complex abelian variety of dimension $g$ where $L$ is a polarization of type $(1,...,1,d)$. For $(X,L)$ genberic we prove the following: (1) If $d \ge g+2$, then $\phi_L\colon X \to {\bf P}^{d-1}$ defines a birational morphism onto its image. (2) If $d > 2^g$, then $L$ is very ample. We show the latter by checking it on a suitable rank-$(g-1)$-degeneration. "
"We provide a proof of a formula conjectured in \cite{OU93} for some coefficients relevant in the principal vertex operator construction of a simply-laced affine algebra $\gh$. These coefficients are important for the study of the topological charges of the solitons of affine Toda theories, and the construction of representations of non-simply-laced $\gh$ and their associated Toda solitons. "
"We give the general form of the vertex corresponding to the interaction of an arbitrary number of strings. The technique employed relies on the ``comma"" representation of String Field Theory where string fields and interactions are represented as matrices and operations between them such as multiplication and trace. The general formulation presented here shows that the interaction vertex of N strings, for any arbitrary N, is given as a function of particular combinations of matrices corresponding to the change of representation between the full string and the half string degrees of freedom. "
"The question concerning the possibility of a first order surface transition in a semi--infinite Blume--Capel model is addressed by means of low temperature expansions. It is found that such a transition can exist, according to mean field and cluster variation approximations, and contrarily to renormalization group results. "
"We suggest the most model-independent and simple description of the $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow\pi\pi$ process near threshold in framework of S-matrix approach. The amplitudes contain the pion polarizabilities and rather restricted information about $\pi \pi$ interaction. Application of these formulae for description of MARK-II \cite{M2} and Crystal Ball \cite{CB} data gives: $(\alpha-\beta)^{C}=(6.0\pm 1.2)\cdot 10^{-42} {\rm cm}^{3}$, $(\alpha-\beta)^{N}=(-1.4\pm 2.1)\cdot 10^{-42} cm^3$ (in units system $e^2 = 4 \pi \alpha$) at the experimental values of $\pi \pi$ scattering lengths. Both values are compartible with current algebra predictions. "
"We use the recently conjectured exact $S$-matrix of the massive ${\rm O}(n)$ model to derive its form factors and ground state energy. This information is then used in the limit $n\to0$ to obtain quantitative results for various universal properties of self-avoiding chains and loops. In particular, we give the first theoretical prediction of the amplitude ratio $C/D$ which relates the mean square end-to-end distance of chains to the mean square radius of gyration of closed loops. This agrees with the results from lattice enumeration studies to within their errors, and gives strong support for the various assumptions which enter into the field theoretic derivation. In addition, we obtain results for the scaling function of the structure factor of long loops, and for various amplitude ratios measuring the shape of self-avoiding chains. These quantities are all related to moments of correlation functions which are evaluated as a sum over $m$-particle intermediate states in the corresponding field theory. We show that in almost all cases, the restriction to $m\leq2$ gives results which are accurate to at least one part in $10^3$. This remarkable fact is traced to a softening of the $m>2$ branch cuts relative to their behaviour based on phase space arguments alone, a result which follows from the threshold behaviour of the two-body $S$-matrix, $S(0)=-1$. Since this is a general property of interacting 2d field theories, it suggests that similar approximations may well hold for other models. However, we also study the moments of the area of self-avoiding loops, "
"We construct the BRST operator for the nonlinear $WB_2$ and $W_4$ algebras. Contrary to the general belief, the nilpotent condition of the BRST operator doesn't determine all the coefficients. We find a three and seven parameter family of nilpotent BRST operator for $WB_2$ and $W_4$ respectively. These free parameters are related to the canonical transformation of the ghost antighost fields. "
D'Eath's proof (hep-th/9304084) that there can be at most two allowed quantum states of N=1 supergravity with zero or a finite number of fermions can be extended to show that there are no such states. 
"The partition function of the discretized superstring in a target superspace of three (Euclidean) bosonic dimensions, is shown, for a fixed triangulation of the random world sheet, to be derived from the partition function of a discretized bosonic string with an external field present in the action in the form of a specific constant matrix, using first order forms of the actions. This latter partition function appears more amenable to an exact analytical treatment. "
"We present a unified string supergravity model based on a string-derived $SU(5)\times U(1)$ model and a string-inspired supersymmetry breaking scenario triggered by the $F$-term of the universally present dilaton field. This model can be described by three parameters: $m_t$, $\tan\beta$, and $m_{\tilde g}$. We work out the predictions for all sparticle and Higgs masses and discuss the prospects for their detection at the Tevatron, LEPI,II, and HERA. We find that the cosmological neutralino relic density is always within current expectations (\ie, $\Omega_\chi h^2_0\lsim0.9$). We also consider a more constrained version of this supersymmetry breaking scenario where the $B$-term is specified. In this case $\tan\beta$ can be determined ($\tan\beta\approx1.4-1.6$) and implies $m_t\lsim155\GeV$ and $m_h\lsim91\GeV$. Thus, continuing Tevatron top-quark searches and LEPI,II Higgs searches could probe this restricted scenario completely. "
The present status of theoretical and experimental investigations of the decay rate of a positronium is considered. The increasing interest to this problem has been caused by the disagreement of the calculated value of $\Gamma_3 (o-Ps)$ and the recent series of precise experiments. The necessity of new calculations on the basis of the quantum field methods in bound state theory is pointed out with taking into account the dependence of the interaction kernel on relative energies. 
"After some general comments about statistics and the TCP theorem, I discuss experimental searches for violations of the exclusion principle and theories which allow for such violations. "
"We study the production of composite scalar leptoquarks in $e\gamma$ colliders, and we show that an $e^+e^-$ machine operating in its $e\gamma$ mode is the best way to look for these particles in $e^+e^-$ collisions, due to the hadronic content of the photon. "
"The symbolic manipulation program Schoonschip is being made freely available for a number of computers with Motorola 680x0 cpu's. It can run on machines with relatively modest memory and disk resources, and is designed to run as fast as possible given the host constraints. Memory and disk utilization can be adapted to tune performance. Recently added capabilities include a system for efficient generation of diagrams, gamma algebra for continuous dimensions, algorithmic improvements for handling large problems, and an increase in the allowed number of {\tt X} expressions. "
"To any non-trivial embedding of sl(2) in a (super) Lie algebra, one can associate an extension of the Virasoro algebra. We realize the extended Virasoro algebra in terms of a WZW model in which a chiral, solvable group is gauged, the gauge group being determined by the sl(2) embedding. The resulting BRST cohomology is computed and the field content of the extended Virasoro algebra is determined. The (quantum) closure of the extended Virasoro algebra is shown. Applications such as the quantum Miura transformation and the effective action of the associated extended gravity theory are discussed in detail. "
"We consider here chiral symmetry breaking through nontrivial vacuum structure with quark antiquark condensates. We then relate the condensate function to the wave function of pion as a Goldstone mode. This simultaneously yields the pion also as a quark antiquark bound state as a localised zero mode in vacuum. We illustrate the above with Nambu Jona-Lasinio model to calculate different pionic properties in terms of the vacuum structure for breaking of exact or approximate chiral symmetry, as well as the condensate fluctuations giving rise to $\sigma$ mesons. "
"Correlators of the octet baryons in the hot pion gas are studied in the framework of the QCD sum rule. The condensates appearing in the OPE side of the correlators become T-dependent through the interaction with thermal pions. We present an explicit demonstration that the $O(T^2)$-dependence of the condensates is completely compensated by the change of the pole residue and the $\pi + B \rightarrow B'$ scattering effect in the spectral functions. Therefore the baryon masses are constant to this order, although $\langle\bar{u}u\rangle_T\simeq\langle\bar{u}u\rangle_0(1-T^2/8f_\pi^2)$, which is consistent with the chiral symmetry constraint by Leutwyler and Smilga. "
"We consider here in a toy model an approach to bound state problem in a nonperturbative manner using equal time algebra for the interacting field operators. Potential is replaced by offshell bosonic quanta inside the bound state of nonrelativistic particles. The bosonic dressing is determined through energy minimisation, and mass renormalisation is carried out in a nonperturbative manner. Since the interaction is through a scalar field, it does not include spin effects. The model however nicely incorporates an intuitive picture of hadronic bound states in which the gluon fields dress the quarks providing the binding between them and also simulate the gluonic content of hadrons in deep inelastic collisions. "
"The $2M$-boson representations of KP hierarchy are constructed in terms of $M$ mutually independent two-boson KP representations for arbitrary number $M$. Our construction establishes the multi-boson representations of KP hierarchy as consistent Poisson reductions of standard KP hierarchy within the $R$-matrix scheme. As a byproduct we obtain a complete description of any finitely-many-field formulation of KP hierarchy in terms of Darboux coordinates with respect to the first Hamiltonian structure. This results in a series of representations of $\Win1\,$ algebra made out of arbitrary even number of boson fields. "
We consider the Ramond sector of the $N=1$ superconformal algebra and find expressions for the singular vectors in reducible highest weight Verma module representations by the fusion principle of Bauer et al. 
"Misprints and numerical coefficients corrected, a bit of phenomenology and one figure added. The case for the linear evolution of the unitarized structure functions made stronger. "
"Quantum Monte Carlo simulations are used to investigate the two-dimensional superfluid properties of the hard-core boson model, which show a strong dependence on particle density and disorder. We obtain further evidence that a half-filled clean system becomes superfluid via a finite temperature Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The relationship between low temperature superfluid density and particle density is symmetric and appears parabolic about the half filling point. Disorder appears to break the superfluid phase up into two distinct localized states, depending on the particle density. We find that these results strongly correlate with the results of several experiments on high-$T_c$ superconductors. "
"It is shown that in both the gluonic and strange sea explanations of the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule violation discovered by the European Muon Collaboration (EMC), the spin of the proton, when viewed in in its rest reference frame, could by fully provided by quarks and antiquarks within a simple quark model picture, taken into account the relativistic effect from the Wigner rotation. "
"We obtain analytic solutions for the density contrast and the anisotropic pressure in a multi-dimensional FRW cosmology with collisionless, massless matter. These are compared with perturbations of a perfect fluid universe. To describe the metric perturbations we use manifest gauge invariant metric potentials. The matter perturbations are calculated by means of (automatically gauge invariant) finite temperature field theory, instead of kinetic theory. (Talk given at the Journ\'ees Relativistes '93, 5 -- 7 April, Brussels, Belgium) "
"In supersymmetric Grand Unified Theories, proton decay mediated by the color--triplet higgsino is generally problematic and requires some fine--tuning of parameters. We present a mechanism which naturally suppresses such dimension 5 operators in the context of SUSY $SO(10)$. The mechanism, which implements natural doublet--triplet splitting using the adjoint higgs, converts these dimension 5 operators effectively into dimension 6. By explicitly computing the higgs spectrum and the resulting threshold uncertainties we show that the successful prediction of $\sin^2\theta_W$ is maintained {\it as a prediction} in this scheme. It is argued that only a weak suppression of the higgsino mediated proton decay is achievable within SUSY $SU(5)$ without fine--tuning, in contrast to a strong suppression in SUSY $SO(10)$. "
I advance arguments against the view that the Lee-Nauenberg-Kinoshita theorem is relevant in practice to the scattering of charged particles as their mass tends to zero. I also discuss the case of massive coloured particle scattering. 
We present explicit generators of an algebra of commuting difference operators with trigonometric coefficients. The operators are simultaneously diagonalized by recently discovered q-polynomials (viz. Koornwinder's multivariable generalization of the Askey-Wilson polynomials). From the viewpoint of physics the algebra can be interpreted as consisting of the quantum integrals of a novel difference-type integrable sytem. This system generalizes the Calogero-Moser systems associated with non-exceptional root systems. 
"A brief review of the confrontation between black hole physics and quantum-mechanical unitarity is presented. Possibile reconciliations are modifying the laws of physics to allow fundamental loss of information, escape of information during the Hawking process, or black hole remnants. Each of these faces serious objections. A better understanding of the problem and its possible solutions can be had by studying two-dimensional models of dilaton gravity. Recent developments in these investigations are summarized. (Linear superposition of talks presented at the 7th Nishinomiya Yukawa Memorial Symposium and at the 1992 YITP Workshop on Quantum Gravity, November 1992.) "
"A method is developed to construct irreducible representations(irreps) of the quantum supergroup $U_q(C(n+1))$ in a systematic fashion. It is shown that every finite dimensional irrep of this quantum supergroup at generic $q$ is a deformation of a finite dimensional irrep of its underlying Lie superalgebra $C(n+1)$, and is essentially uniquely characterized by a highest weight. The character of the irrep is given. When $q$ is a root of unity, all irreps of $U_q(C(n+1))$ are finite dimensional; multiply atypical highest weight irreps and (semi)cyclic irreps also exist. As examples, all the highest weight and (semi)cyclic irreps of $U_q(C(2))$ are thoroughly studied. "
"We study the process of thermal activation mediated by sphaleron transitions by analyzing the real-time dynamics of the decay out of equilibrium in a $1+1$ dimensional field theory with a metastable state. The situation considered is that of a rapid supercooling in which the system is trapped in a metastable state at a temperature larger than the mass of the quanta, but smaller than the energy to create a critical droplet. The initial density matrix is evolved in time and the nucleation rate (probability current at the saddle point) is computed. The nucleation rate is {\it time dependent}, vanishing at early times, reaching a maximum at a time $t \approx 1/m$ with $m$ the mass of quanta in the metastable state, and decreasing at long times as a consequence of unitarity. An estimate for the average number of particles of ``true vacuum'' produced as a function of time during the nucleation process is obtained. "
"We formulate the chiral perturbation theory at the one loop level in the effective lagrangian including the $\rho$ meson as a dynamical gauge boson of a hidden local symmetry(HLS). The size of radiative correction to the phenomenological parameter $a$ of HLS is estimated to be about $10$\%. The complete list of ${\cal O}(E^4)$ terms is given and the one loop counter terms are determined explicitly in the $N$ flavor model. We also obtain matching conditions to the conventional chiral perturbation of Gasser and Leutwyler in the chiral limit in a renormalization scale independent manner. We find that Gasser--Leutwyler's estimates for $L_{9,10}$ are saturated by $\rho$ and its one loop contributions without introducing non-minimal couplings of $\pi$-$\rho$ system, suggesting the absence of the tree level $a_1$ meson contributions. "
We discuss the phenomenology of an $SU(2)_{TC}$ technicolour model with a low technicolour confinement scale ${\Lambda}_{TC} \sim 50-100 GeV$. Such a low technicolour scale may give rise to the first hints of technicolour being seen at LEPI and spectacular technicolour signals at LEPII. 
We perform a BRST analysis of the N=2 superconformal minimal unitary models. A bosonic as well as fermionic BRST operators are used to construct irreducible representations of the N=2 superconformal algebra on the Fock space as BRST cohomology classes of the BRST operators. Also a character formula is rederived by using the BRST analysis. 
"We demonstrate, by numerical simulations, that the dynamics of nuclear matter mean field inside the spinodal region is chaotic. Spontaneous symmetry-breaking - no explicit fluctuating term is considered - occurs leading to wild unpredictable density fluctuations. A proper recipe to calculate an average Lyapunov exponent in this multidimensional phase space is introduced. The latter is calculated for different values of the density in order to characterize in a quantitative way the chaotic and regular regions. It is argued that the mean field chaoticity can be the main mechanism of the nuclear multifragmentation occurring in the intermediate energy reactions. "
"The statistical mechanics of an anyon gas in a magnetic field is addressed. An harmonic regulator is used to define a proper thermodynamic limit. When the magnetic field is sufficiently strong, only exact $N$-anyon groundstates, where anyons occupy the lowest Landau level, contribute to the equation of state. Particular attention is paid to the interval of definition of the statistical parameter $\alpha\in[-1,0]$ where a gap exists. Interestingly enough, one finds that at the critical filling $\nu=-{1/\alpha}$ where the pressure diverges, the external magnetic field is entirely screened by the flux tubes carried by the anyons. "
"We present methods for evaluating the Feynman parameter integrals associated with the pentagon diagram in 4-2 epsilon dimensions, along with explicit results for the integrals with all masses vanishing or with one non-vanishing external mass. The scalar pentagon integral can be expressed as a linear combination of box integrals, up to O(epsilon) corrections, a result which is the dimensionally-regulated version of a D=4 result of Melrose, and of van Neerven and Vermaseren. We obtain and solve differential equations for various dimensionally-regulated box integrals with massless internal lines, which appear in one-loop n-point calculations in QCD. We give a procedure for constructing the tensor pentagon integrals needed in gauge theory, again through O(epsilon^0). "
"We investigate 4$d$ SU(2) lattice gauge theory with Regge--Einstein quantum gravity on a dynamically coupled Regge skeleton. To overview the phase diagram we perform simulations on a small $2\cdot 4^3$ system. Evidence for an entropy--dominated disordered, an entropy--dominated ordered and an ill--defined region is presented. "
"I present the detailed behavior of phonon dispersion curves near momenta which span the electronic Fermi sea in a superconductor. I demonstrate that an anomaly, similar to the metallic Kohn anomaly, exists in a superconductor's dispersion curves when the frequency of the phonon spanning the Fermi sea exceeds twice the superconducting energy gap. This anomaly occurs at approximately the same momentum but is {\it stronger} than the normal-state Kohn anomaly. It also survives at finite temperature, unlike the metallic anomaly. Determination of Fermi surface diameters from the location of these anomalies, therefore, may be more successful in the superconducting phase than in the normal state. However, the superconductor's anomaly fades rapidly with increased phonon frequency and becomes unobservable when the phonon frequency greatly exceeds the gap. This constraint makes these anomalies useful only in high-temperature superconductors such as $\rm La_{1.85}Sr_{.15}CuO_4$. "
"A formalism describing the dynamics of classical and quantum systems from a group theoretical point of view is presented. We apply it to the simple example of the classical free particle. The Galileo group $G$ is the symmetry group of the free equations of motion. Consideration of the free particle Lagrangian semi-invariance under $G$ leads to a larger symmetry group, which is a central extension of the Galileo group by the real numbers. We study the dynamics associated with this group, and characterize quantities like Noether invariants and evolution equations in terms of group geometric objects. An extension of the Galileo group by U(1) leads to quantum mechanics. "
"Color transparency predicts that, in $(e,e'p)$ reactions at large $Q^2$, the final-state interaction becomes weaker than the reference value predicted from the free-nucleon cross section. This reference value is usually evaluated in the dilute-gas approximation to Glauber's multiple-scattering theory. We derive the leading-order correction taking into account two-body correlations. Large cancellations are found so that the overall correlation effect is small. "
"We examine the problem of three generation quark flavor mixing in realistic, superstring derived standard--like models, constructed in the free fermionic formulation. We study the sources of family mixing in these models and discuss the necessary conditions to obtain a realistic Cabibbo--Kobayashi--Maskawa (CKM) mixing matrix. In a specific model, we estimate the mixing angles and discuss the weak CP violating phase. We argue that the superstring standard--like models can produce a realistic CKM mixing matrix. We discuss the possible textures of quark mass matrices that may be obtained in these models. "
"Let $E$ be an operator space in the sense of the theory recently developed by Blecher-Paulsen and Effros-Ruan. We introduce a notion of $E$-valued non commutative $L_p$-space for $1 \leq p < \infty$ and we prove that the resulting operator space satisfies the natural properties to be expected with respect to e.g. duality and interpolation. This notion leads to the definition of a ``completely p-summing"" map which is the operator space analogue of the $p$-absolutely summing maps in the sense of Pietsch-Kwapie\'n. These notions extend the particular case $p=1$ which was previously studied by Effros-Ruan. "
"Differential cross sections for $^3$He-$\alpha$ scattering were measured in the energy range up to 3 MeV. These data together with other available experimental results for $^3$He $+ \alpha$ and $^3$H $+ \alpha$ scattering were analyzed in the framework of the optical model using double-folded potentials. The optical potentials obtained were used to calculate the astrophysical S-factors of the capture reactions $^3$He$(\alpha,\gamma)^7$Be and $^3$H$(\alpha,\gamma)^7$Li, and the branching ratios for the transitions into the two final $^7$Be and $^7$Li bound states, respectively. For $^3$He$(\alpha,\gamma)^7$Be excellent agreement between calculated and experimental data is obtained. For $^3$H$(\alpha,\gamma)^7$Li a $S(0)$ value has been found which is a factor of about 1.5 larger than the adopted value. For both capture reactions a similar branching ratio of $R = \sigma(\gamma_1)/\sigma(\gamma_0) \approx 0.43$ has been obtained. "
"We derive loop equations for the one-link correlators of gauge and scalar fields in the Kazakov-Migdal model. These equations determine the solution of the model in the large N limit and are similar to analogous equations for the Hermitean two-matrix model. We give an explicit solution of the equations for the case of a Gaussian, quadratic potential. We also show how similar calculations in a non-Gaussian case reduce to purely algebraic equations. "
"Linear rate equations are used to describe the cascading decay of an initial heavy cluster into fragments. Using a procedure inspired by the similar, but continuous case of jet fragmentation in QCD, this discretized process may be analyzed into eigenmodes, corresponding to moments of the distribution of multiplicities. The orders of these moments are usually noninteger numbers. The resulting analysis can be made time independent and is applicable to various phenomenological multifragmentation processes, in which case it leads to new approximate finite-size scaling relations for the spectrum of fragments. "
Orthogonal polynomial random matrix models of NxN hermitian matrices lead to Fredholm determinants of integral operators with kernel of the form (phi(x) psi(y) - psi(x) phi(y))/x-y. This paper is concerned with the Fredholm determinants of integral operators having kernel of this form and where the underlying set is a union of open intervals. The emphasis is on the determinants thought of as functions of the end-points of these intervals. We show that these Fredholm determinants with kernels of the general form described above are expressible in terms of solutions of systems of PDE's as long as phi and psi satisfy a certain type of differentiation formula. There is also an exponential variant of this analysis which includes the circular ensembles of NxN unitary matrices. 
"We study certain interpolation and extension properties of the space of regular operators between two Banach lattices. Let $R_p$ be the space of all the regular (or equivalently order bounded) operators on $L_p$ equipped with the regular norm. We prove the isometric identity $R_p = (R_\infty,R_1)^\theta$ if $\theta = 1/p$, which shows that the spaces $(R_p)$ form an interpolation scale relative to Calder\'on's interpolation method. We also prove that if $S\subset L_p$ is a subspace, every regular operator $u : S \to L_p$ admits a regular extension $\tilde u : L_p \to L_p$ with the same regular norm. This extends a result due to Mireille L\'evy in the case $p = 1$. Finally, we apply these ideas to the Hardy space $H^p$ viewed as a subspace of $L_p$ on the circle. We show that the space of regular operators from $H^p$ to $L_p$ possesses a similar interpolation property as the spaces $R_p$ defined above. "
Soluble model of a relativistic particle describing a bag of matter with fixed radius held together in perfect balance by a self-consistent combination of three forces generated by electromagnetic and massive scalar and vector fields is presented. For realistic values of parameters the bag radius becomes that of a proton. 
"The new solution of the Einstein equations in empty space is presented. The solution is constructed using Schwarzschild solution but essentially differs from it. The basic properties of the solution are: the existence of a horizon which is a hyperboloid of one sheet moving along its axis with superluminal velocity, right signature of the metric outside the horizon and Minkovsky-flatness of it at infinity outside the horizon. There is also a discussion in the last chapter, including comparing with recent astronomical observations. "
"We present explicit expressions for the calculation of cosmological look back time, for zero cosmological constant and arbitrary density parameter $\Omega$, which, in the limit as redshift becomes infinite, give the age of the universe. The case for non-zero cosmological constant is most easily solved via numerical integration. The most distant objects presently known (approaching redshift z = 5) have implied ages of $\approx$ 1-2 Gyr after the the Big Bang. The range of such age is narrow, in spite of a variety of cosmological models one might choose. We give a graphical representation of a variety of cosmological models and show that a wide range of Hubble constants and values of the age and density of the universe compatible with modern studies are consistent with adoption of a positive cosmological constant. "
"We calculate the electron elastic mean free path due to ionized impurity scattering in semiconductor quantum wires, using a scheme in which the screened ionized impurity potential and the electron screening self-consistently determine each other. By using a short-range scattering potential model, we obtain an {\sl exact} solution of the self-energy within the self-consistent Born and ``noncrossing"" approximations. We find that, compared to the mean free path for the bare unscreened potential $\ell_{\rm bare}$, the calculated mean free path including self-consistent screening $\ell_{\rm sc}$ is {\sl substantially larger}, going as $\ell_{\rm sc} \sim \ell_{\rm bare}[\ln(\ell_{\rm bare})]^2$ for large $\ell_{\rm bare}$. "
"The free energy and correlation lengths of the spin-1/2 $XYZ$ chain are studied at finite temperature. We use the quantum transfer matrix approach and derive non-linear integral equations for all eigenvalues. Analytic results are presented for the low-temperature asymptotics, in particular for the critical $XXZ$ chain in an external magnetic field. These results are compared to predictions by conformal field theory. The integral equations are solved numerically for the non-critical $XXZ$ chain and the related spin-1 biquadratic chain at arbitrary temperature. "
A recently introduced cellular automaton model for the description of traffic flow is investigated. It generalises asymmetric exclusion models which have attracted a lot of interest in the past. We calculate the so-called fundamental diagram (flow vs.\ density) for parallel dynamics using an improved mean-field approximation which takes into account short-range correlations. For maximum velocity 1 we find that the simplest non-trivial of these approximations gives already the exact result. For higher velocities our results are in excellent agreement with numerical data. 
"We present results of extensive statistical and bit level tests on three implementations of a pseudorandom number generator algorithm using the lagged Fibonacci method with an occasional addition of an extra bit. First implementation is the RCARRY generator of James, which uses subtraction. The second is a modified version of it, where a suggested error present in the original implementation has been corrected. The third is our modification of RCARRY such that it utilizes addition of the carry bit. Our results show that there are no significant differences between the performance of these three generators. "
"We classify the operator content of local hermitian scalar operators in the Sinh-Gordon model by means of independent solutions of the form-factor bootstrap equations. The corresponding linear space is organized into a tower-like structure of dimension $n$ for the form factors $F_{2n}$ and $F_{2n-1}$. Analyzing the cluster property of the form factors, a particular class of these solutions can be identified with the matrix elements of the operators $e^{k g\phi}$. We also present the complete expression of the form factors of the elementary field $\phi(x)$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $\Theta(x)$. "
"The second-quantized form of the Laughlin states for the fractional quantum Hall effect is discussed by decomposing the Laughlin wavefunctions into the $N$-particle Slater basis. A general formula is given for the expansion coefficients in terms of the characters of the symmetric group, and the expansion coefficients are shown to possess numerous interesting symmetries. For expectation values of the density operator it is possible to identify individual dominant Slater states of the correct uniform bulk density and filling fraction in the physically relevant $N\to\infty$ limit. "
"A slight incompatibility in recent low-energy and high-energy \alpha_s measurements can be interpreted as evidence for new light colour degrees of freedom. Assuming that these are the gluinos of a supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, we investigate to what extent they change the standard QCD predictions for deep inelastic structure functions, and in particular whether thay can be detected in such measurements at HERA. We present a modified set of parton distributions which includes a light gluino distribution and which can be used for further phenomenological investigations. "
"The composite system, formed by two $S=1$ particles, is considered. The field operators of constituents are transformed on the $(1,0)\oplus (0,1)$ representation of the Lorentz group. The problem of interaction of $S=1$ particle with the electromagnetic field is also discussed. "
The consequences of rotational invariance in a recent theory of fluctuations in dilute polymer nematics are explored. A correct rotationally invariant free energy insures that anomalous couplings are not generated in a one-loop renormalization group calculation. 
"The global properties of spatially homogeneous cosmological models with collisionless matter are studied. It is shown that as long as the mean curvature of the hypersurfaces of homogeneity remains finite no singularity can occur in finite proper time as measured by observers whose worldlines are orthogonal to these hypersurfaces. Strong cosmic censorship is then proved for the Bianchi I, Bianchi IX and Kantowski-Sachs symmetry classes. "
"Large-scale structures, observed today, are generally believed to have grown from random, small-amplitude inhomogeneities, present in the early Universe. We investigate how gravitational instability drives the distribution of these fluctuations away from the initial state, assumed to be Gaussian. Using second order perturbation theory, we calculate the skewness factor, $S_3 \equiv \langle \delta^3 \rangle \, /\, \langle \delta^2 \rangle^2$. Here the brackets, $\langle \ldots \rangle$, denote an ensemble average, and $\delta$ is the density contrast field, smoothed with a low pass spatial filter. We show that $S_3$ decreases with the slope of the fluctuation power spectrum; it depends only weakly on $\Omega$, the cosmological density parameter. We compare perturbative calculations with N-body experiments and find excellent agreement over a wide dynamic range. If galaxies trace the mass, measurements of $S_3$ can be used to distinguish models with Gaussian initial conditions from their non-Gaussian alternatives. "
Two compactifications of the space of holomorphic maps of fixed degree from a compact Riemann surface to a Grassmannian are studied. It is shown that the Uhlenbeck compactification has the structure of a projective scheme and is dominated by the algebraic compactification arising as a Grothendieck Quot scheme. The latter may be embedded into the moduli space of solutions to a generalized version of the vortex equations studied by Bradlow. This gives an effective way of computing certain intersection numbers (known as Gromov invariants) on the space of holomorphic maps into Grassmannians. We carry out these computations in the case where the Riemann surface has genus one. 
"We show that at the leading order in the large-$N$ expansion a lattice QCD motivated linear rising confinement potential at large distances leads to a non-local four-quark interaction that realizes spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry (SBCS) in the same way the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model does. The dynamical quark mass $m$, which represents the solution of the gap-equation, is proportional to the square root of the string tension $\sigma$ and takes the form at the leading order in the large-$N$ expansion $m=2 \sqrt{\sigma}/\pi$ with $\sigma=0.27$ GeV$^2$. The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio phenomenological constant $G_1$, which is responsible for SBCS, is expressed in terms of the string tension and the confinement radius. "
"This is a survey of four recent papers which deal with the relationship of simple C*-algebras to the problem of computing the spectra of self-adjoint operators in the general case, especially when the spectrum is not discrete. It is an expanded version of a talk presented at the 50 year C*-algebra celebration, held at the annual meeting of the AMS in San Antonio during January, 1993. "
"We analyze SU(2) gauge theory in a constant chromomagnetic field in three dimensions. Our analysis instead of supporting the existence of a non-trivial minimum in the effective potential, corroborates the evidence of the unstable modes on the lattice. "
"In my book ""Algorithmic Information Theory"" I explain how I constructed a million-character equation that proves that there is randomness in arithmetic. My book only includes a few pages from the monster equation, and omits the software used to construct it. This software has now been rewritten in Mathematica. The Mathematica software for my book, and its input, are here in their entirety. The Mathematica code is remarkably compact, but it sometimes is slow. So one C program plus equipment for automatically generating another is also included in this software package. "
"Based on ideas of off-diagonal long range order and two-fluid model, we demonstrate that adiabatic phases for a slow motion of a vortex in a superconductor film give rise naturally to the Magnus force at finite temperatures. "
"We proof that the proton is stable in the left-right symmetric gauge model [SU(6)]$^3\times$Z$_3$, which unifies nongravitational forces with flavors, broken spontaneously by a minimal set of Higgs Fields and Vacuum Expectation Values down to SU(3)$_{c}\otimes$U(1)$_{EM}$\hspace{0.2cm} . We also compute the evolution of the gauge coupling constants and show how agreement with precision data can be obtained. "
"We derive a set of relativistic three-particle scattering equations in the three-particle c.m. frame employing a relativistic three-particle propagator suggested long ago by Ahmadzadeh and Tjon in the c.m. frame of a two-particle subsystem. We make the coordinate transformation of this propagator from the c.m. frame of the two-particle subsystem to the three-particle c.m. frame. We also point out that some numerical applications of the Ahmadzadeh and Tjon propagator to the three-nucleon problem use unnecessary nonrelativistic approximations which do not simplify the computational task, but violate constraints of relativistic unitarity and/or covariance. "
We investigate rotation and rotating structures in (2+1)-dimensional Einstein gravity. We show that rotation generally leads to pathological physical situations. 
"Within the supergravity framework, sleptons are expected to be considerably lighter than squarks if gluinos and squarks are approximately degenerate. This can lead to a significant enhancement in leptonic branching ratio for neutralinos, and sometimes, charginos. Using ISAJET 7.0/ISASUSY 1.0, we evaluate the multilepton signals from cascade decays of gluinos and squarks produced at the Fermilab Tevatron $p\bar p$ collider assuming squark and slepton masses are related as in supergravity models. We find observable cross sections for spectacular event topologies: $m$-lepton + $n$-jet + $\eslt$ events ($m \leq 4$, $n \geq 2$) and same-sign dilepton + $\eslt$ events and show that the SM backgrounds to the isolated trilepton, four lepton and same-sign dilepton signals are very small. These signals can extend the mass reach of the Tevatron experiments to $m_{\tg}\sim 300$~GeV if $m_{\tg}\sim m_{\tq}$ and ${\cal O}(1000)$ pb$^{-1}$ of data are collected. "
"Following the formalism of Gell-Mann and Hartle, phenomenological equations of motion are derived from the decoherence functional formalism of quantum mechanics, using a path-integral description. This is done explicitly for the case of a system interacting with a ``bath'' of harmonic oscillators whose individual motions are neglected. The results are compared to the equations derived from the purely classical theory. The case of linear interactions is treated exactly, and nonlinear interactions are compared using classical and quantum perturbation theory. "
"The COBE results, to be followed in the near future by other Cosmic Microwave Background measurements, are providing us with a new fundamental tool to probe the formation of large scale structure in the Universe, and in so doing to constrain our models of the early universe and the nature of dark matter. I describe briefly here how to interpret the COBE results data with these in mind, and conclude with a discussion of implications for the future. "
We investigate the excitation spectrum of a model of $N$ colour fermions with correlated hopping which can be solved by a nested Bethe ansatz. The gapless excitations of particle-hole type are calculated as well as the spin-wave like excitations which have a gap. Using general predictions of conformal field theory the long distance behaviour of some groundstate correlation functions are derived from a finite-size analysis of the gapless excitations. From the algebraic decay we show that for increasing particle density the correlation of so-called $N$-multiplets of particles dominates over the density-density correlation. This indicates the presence of bound complexes of these $N$-multiplets. This picture is also supported by the calculation of the effective mass of charge carriers. 
"In this note, based on a conference talk, we show how a 3 dimensional topological field theory leads to an algebraic gadget roughly equivalent to a quantum group. This is an expository version of some material in hep-th/9212115 (where we also carry out computations for a specific finite example). We also explain how to incorporate the central extensions usually explained via ``framings'', and we show how to recover invariants of framed tangles. This paper is written using AMSTeX 2.1, which can be obtained via ftp from the American Mathematical Society (instructions included). 2 encapsulated postscript files were submitted separately in uuencoded tar-compressed format. "
"We investigate the properties of the one-electron Green's function in an interacting two-dimensional electron system in a strong magnetic field, which describes an electron tunneling into such a system. From finite-size diagonalization, we find that its spectral weight is suppressed near zero energy, reaches a maximum at an energy of about $0.2e^{2}/\epsilon l_{c}$, and decays exponentially at higher energies. We propose a theoretical model to account for the low-energy behavior. For the case of Coulomb interactions between the electrons, at even-denominator filling factors such as $\nu=1/2$, we predict that the spectral weight varies as $e^{-\omega_0/|\omega|}$, for $\omega\rightarrow 0$. "
"I consider the Hermitean two-matrix model with a logarithmic potential which is associated in the one-matrix case with the Penner model. Using loop equations I find an explicit solution of the model at large N (or in the spherical approximation) and demonstrate that it solves the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem. I construct the potential of the Kazakov-Migdal model on a D-dimensional lattice, which turns out to be a sum of two logarithms as well, whose large-N solution is given by the same formulas. In the ""naive"" continuum limit this potential recovers in D<4 dimensions the standard scalar theory with quartic self-interaction. I exploit the solution to calculate explicitly the pair correlator of gauge fields in the Kazakov-Migdal model with the logarithmic potential. "
"Together with the existence of new neutral gauge bosons, models based on extended gauge groups (rank $> 4$) often predict also new charged fermions. A mixing of the known fermions with new states with {\it exotic} weak-isospin assignments (left-handed singlets and right-handed doublets) will induce tree level flavour changing neutral interactions mediated by $Z$ exchange, while if the mixing is only with new states with {\it ordinary} weak-isospin assignments, the flavour changing neutral currents are mainly due to the exchange of the lightest new neutral gauge boson $Z^\prime$. We show that the present experimental limits on $\mu-e$ conversion in nuclei give a nuclear-model-independent bound on the $Z$-$e$-$\mu$ vertex which is twice as strong as that obtained from $\mu\to e e e$. In the case of E$_6$ models these limits provide quite stringent constraints on the $Z^\prime$ mass and on the $Z-Z^\prime$ mixing angle. We point out that the proposed experiments to search for $\mu-e$ conversion in nuclei have good chances to find evidence of lepton flavour violation, either in the case that new exotic fermions are present at the electroweak scale, or if a new neutral gauge boson $Z^\prime$ of E$_6$ origin lighter than a few TeV exists. "
We consider open strings in an external constant magnetic field $H$. For an (infinite) sequence of critical values of $H$ an increasing number of (highest spin component) states lying on the first Regge trajectory becomes tachyonic. In the limit of infinite $H$ all these states are tachyons (with a common tachyonic mass) both in the case of the bosonic string and for the Neveu-Schwarz sector of the fermionic string. This result generalizes to extended object the same instability which occurs in ordinary non-Abelian gauge theories. The Ramond states have always positive square masses as is the case for ordinary QED. The weak field limit of the mass spectrum is the same as for a field theory with gyromagnetic ratio $g_S=2$ for all charged spin states. This behavior suggests a phase transition of the string as it has been argued for the ordinary electroweak theory. 
Gravitational Compton scattering process with a massive fermion is studied in the context of the linearized gravity. Gravitational gauge invariance and graviton transversality cause the transition amplitude to be factorized into that of scalar QED Compton scattering and that of fermion QED Compton scattering with an overall kinematical factor. The factorization is shown explicitly and its physical implications are discussed.

"We prove, using arguments relying only on the ""special K\""ahler"" structure of the moduli space of the Calabi-Yau three-fold, that in the case of one single modulus the quantum modular group of the string effective action corresponding to Calabi-Yau vacua can not be SL(2,${Z\kern -4.6pt Z}$). "
"Let $E$ be one of the spaces $C(K)$ and $L_1$, $F$ be an arbitrary Banach space, $p>1,$ and $(X,\sigma)$ be a space with a finite measure. We prove that $E$ is isometric to a subspace of the Lebesgue-Bochner space $L_p(X;F)$ only if $E$ is isometric to a subspace of $F.$ Moreover, every isometry $T$ from $E$ into $L_p(X;F)$ has the form $Te(x)=h(x)U(x)e, e\in E,$ where $h:X\rightarrow R$ is a measurable function and, for every $x\in X,$ $U(x)$ is an isometry from $E$ to $F.$ "
"We compare the free energy computed from the ground state energy and low-lying excitations of the 2-D Wigner solid and the fractional quantum Hall liquid, at magnetic filling factors $\nu = 1/7$ and 1/9. We find that the Wigner solid melts into the fractional quantum Hall liquid at roughly the same temperature as that of some recent luminescence experiments, while it remains a solid at the lower temperatures characteristic of the transport experiments. We propose this melting as a consistent interpretation of both sets of experiments. "
"We study contributions to $K_L \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ from anomalous $WWZ$ interactions. There are, in general, seven anomalous couplings. Among the seven anomalous couplings, only two of them contribute significantly. The others are suppressed by factors like $m_s^2/M_W^2$, $m_d^2$, or $m_K^2/M_W^2$. Using the experimental data on $K_L\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$, we obtain strong bounds on the two anomalous couplings. "
A selfcontained proof of the KAM theorem in the Thirring model is discussed. 
"Let $(M,\mu)$ and $(N,\nu)$ be measure spaces. In this paper, we study the $K_t$--\,functional for the couple $$A_0=L^\infty(d\mu\,; L^1(d\nu))\,,~~A_1=L^\infty(d\nu\,; L^1(d\mu))\,. $$ Here, and in what follows the vector valued $L^p$--\,spaces $L^p(d\mu\,; L^q(d\nu))$ are meant in Bochner's sense. One of our main results is the following, which can be viewed as a refinement of a lemma due to Varopoulos [V]. \proclaim Theorem 0.1. Let $(A_0,A_1)$ be as above. Then for all $f$ in $A_0+A_1$ we have $${1\over 2}\,K_t(f;\,A_0\,,A_1)\leq \sup\,\bigg\{ \Big(\mu(E)\vee t^{-1}\nu(F)\Big)^{-1} \int_{E\times F} \vert f\vert\,d\mu\,d\nu\,\bigg\} \leq K_t(f;\,A_0\,,A_1)\,,$$ where the supremum runs over all measurable subsets $E\subset M\,,~ F\subset N$ with positive and finite measure and $u\!\vee\!v$ denotes the maximum of the reals $u$ and $v$.

We discuss a class of transfer matrix built by a particular combination of isomorphic and non-isomorphic GL(N) invariant vertex operators. We construct a conformally invariant magnet constituted of an alternating mixture of GL(N) ``spins'' operators at different order of representation. The corresponding central charge is calculated by analysing the low temperature behaviour of the associated free energy. We also comment on possible extensions of our results for more general classes of mixed systems. 
"We make a number of small changes, including correcting an error in our heavy-neutrino decay rate. None of our analysis is changed, either in substance or detail. "
We analyze the CELLO angular distributions $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-$ with the unitary model \cite{KS-86} for helicity 2 amplitude. In contrast to previous analysis \cite{CELLO} we do not see any QED damping. The obtained S--wave does not contradict to low--energy theorem and demonstrates more clealy the resonance--like behaviour near 1.3 Gev. 
"We comment on some calculations concerning the finite-thickness corrections to the (generalized) Nambu action for a curved domain wall in Minkowski space. Contrary to a recent claim in the literature, we find no first order corrections in the wall-thickness, and only one second order correction proportional to the Ricci curvature of the wall. These results are obtained by consistently expanding the action and the equations of motion for the scalar field. "
"A class of models with applications to swarm behavior as well as many other types of spatially extended complex biological and physical systems is studied. Internal fluctuations can play an active role in the organization of the phase structure of such systems. Consequently, it is not possible to fully understand the behavior of these systems without explicitly incorporating the fluctuations. In particular, for the class of models studied here the effect of internal fluctuations due to finite size is a renormalized decrease in the temperature near the point of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We briefly outline how these models can be applied to the behavior of an ant swarm. "
"Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transitions in $N$-fold degenerate Hubbard models are studied within the Gutzwiller approximation. For any rational filling with $x$ (integer) electrons per site it is found that metal-insulator transition occurs at a critical correlation energy $U_c(N,x)=U_c(N,2N-x)=\gamma(N,x)|\bar{\epsilon}(N,x)|$, where $\bar{\epsilon}$ is the band energy per particle for the uncorrelated Fermi-liquid state and $\gamma(N,x)$ is a geometric factor which increases linearly with $x$. We propose that the alkali metal doped fullerides $A_xC_{60}$ can be described by a 3-fold degenerate Hubbard model. Using the current estimate of band width and correlation energy this implies that most of ${\rm A_xC_{60}}$, at integer $x$, are Mott-Hubbard insulators and ${\rm A_3C_{60}}$ is a strongly correlated metal. "
"Synchronization among globally coupled, chaotic map lattices can be related to stable periodic windows in isolated chaotic maps. This relation provides a simple predictive tool for the understanding of complicated behavior in coupled physical, chemical and biological systems. "
We discuss a class of transfer matrix built by a particular combination of isomorphic and non-isomorphic GL(N) invariant vertex operators. We construct a conformally invariant magnet co nstituted of an alternating mixture of GL(N) ``spins'' operators at different order of represent ation. The corresponding central charge is calculated by analysing the low temperature beha viour of the associated free energy. We also comment on possible extensions of our results for more general classes of mixed systems. 
"We examine the structure of the underlying event in neutral Higgs production at the Superconducting-Supercollider (SSC). Gaps, regions of rapidity containing no soft particle production, can provide a clean signature for $W$ boson fusion to the heavy Higgs. We first examine the physical basis of gap production and estimate the survival probability of gaps in the minijet model. Then, using PYTHIA, and HERWIG we compare gap events to $W$ pair production from top decay and $q\bar{q}$ fusion. We find that, if experimental problems can be overcome, gaps should provide a small, but clean, signal for heavy Higgs production at the SSC. "
High accuracy Monte Carlo simulation results for 1024*1024 Ising system with ferromagnetic impurity bonds are presented. Spin-spin correlation function at a critical point is found to be numerically very close to that of a pure system. This is not trivial since a critical temperature for the system with impurities is almost two times lower than pure Ising $T_c$. Small deviations from the pure behaviour contradict to some of the competing theories. 
"We examine the problem of determining which representations of the braid group on a Riemann surface are carried by the wave function of a quantized Abelian Chern-Simons theory interacting with non-dynamical matter. We generalize the quantization of Chern-Simons theory to the case where the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term, $k$, is rational, the Riemann surface has arbitrary genus and the total matter charge is non-vanishing. We find an explicit solution of the Schr\""odinger equation. We find that the wave functions carry a representation of the braid group as well as a projective representation of the discrete group of large gauge transformations. We find a fundamental constraint which relates the charges of the particles, $q_i$, the coefficient $k$ and the genus of the manifold, $g$. "
"Levinson's theorem for Dirac particles constraints the sum of the phase shifts at threshold by the total number of bound states of the Dirac equation. Recently, a stronger version of Levinson's theorem has been proven in which the value of the positive- and negative-energy phase shifts are separately constrained by the number of bound states of an appropriate set of Schr\""odinger-like equations. In this work we elaborate on these ideas and show that the stronger form of Levinson's theorem relates the individual phase shifts directly to the number of bound states of the Dirac equation having an even or odd number of nodes. We use a mean-field approximation to Walecka's scalar-vector model to illustrate this stronger form of Levinson's theorem. We show that the assignment of bound states to a particular phase shift should be done, not on the basis of the sign of the bound-state energy, but rather, in terms of the nodal structure (even/odd number of nodes) of the bound state. "
"Some intriging connections between the properties of nonlinear noise driven systems and the nonlinear dynamics of a particular set of Hamilton's equation are discussed. A large class of Fokker-Planck Equations, like the Schr\""odinger equation, can exhibit a transition in their spectral statistics as a coupling parameter is varied. This transition is connected to the transition to non-integrability in the Hamilton's equations. "
"We study the Abelian Thirring Model when the fermionic fields have non-conserved chiral charge: $\Delta {\cal Q}_5 =N$. One of the main features we find for this model is the dependence of the Virasoro central charge on both the Thirring coupling constant and $N$. We show how to evaluate correlation functions and in particular we compute the conformal dimensions for fermions and fermionic bilinears, which depend on the fermionic chiral charge. Finally we build primary fields with arbitrary conformal weight. "
"In this paper we survey the signals and backgrounds for a strongly-interacting electroweak symmetry breaking sector at hadron supercolliders in the TeV region. We study the process pp->WWX, and compute the rates for the ``gold-plated'' channels, where W^{+/-}->l^{+/-}\nu and Z -> l^+l^- (l = e,\mu), for a wide variety of models. Using a forward jet-tag, a central jet-veto and a back-to-back lepton cut to suppress the Standard Model backgrounds, we demonstrate that the SSC and LHC have substantial sensitivity to strong interactions in the electroweak symmetry breaking sector. "
"Using Green$'$s function and operator techniques we give a closed expression for the response of a non-relativistic system interacting through confining, harmonic forces. The expression for the incoherent part permits rapid evaluation of coefficients in a 1/q expansion. A comparison is made with standard approximation methods. "
"We establish a correspondence between the evolution of the distribution of eigenvalues of a $N\times N$ matrix subject to a random Gaussian perturbing matrix, and a Fokker-Planck equation postulated by Dyson. Within this model, we prove the equivalence conjectured by Altshuler et al between the space-time correlations of the Sutherland-Calogero-Moser system in the thermodynamic limit and a set of two-variable correlations for disordered quantum systems calculated by them. Multiple variable correlation functions are, however, shown to be inequivalent for the two cases. "
"If massive black holes constitute the dark matter in the halo surrounding the Milky Way, the existence of low mass globular clusters in the halo suggests an upper limit to their mass, $M_{_{BH}}$. We use a combination of the impulse approximation and numerical simulations to constrain $M_{_{BH}} \lsim 10^3M_\odot$, otherwise several of the halo globular clusters would be heated to disruption within one half of their lifetime. Taken at face value, this constraint is three orders of magnitude stronger than the previous limit provided by disk heating arguments. However, since the initial mass function of clusters is unknown, we argue that the real constraint is at most, an order of magnitude weaker. Our results rule out cosmological scenarios, such as versions of the Primordial Baryonic Isocurvature fluctuation model, which invoke the low Jeans mass at early epochs to create a large population of black holes of mass $\sim 10^6M_\odot$. "
Exact diagonalizations of two dimensional small t--J clusters reveal dominant hole-hole correlations at distance $\sqrt{2}$ (ie between holes on next nearest neighbor sites). A new form of singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pair operator is proposed to account for the spatial extention of the two hole-bound pair beyond nearest neighbor sites. 
"We present a generic Lagrangian, in arbitrary spacetime dimension $D$, describing the interaction of a dilaton, a graviton and an antisymmetric tensor of arbitrary rank $d$. For each $D$~and~$d$, we find ``solitonic'' black $\tilde{p}$-brane solutions where $\tilde{p} = \tilde{d} - 1$~and~ $\tilde d = D - d - 2$. These solutions display a spacetime singularity surrounded by an event horizon, and are characterized by a mass per unit $\tilde p$-volume, ${\cal M}_{\tilde{d}}$, and topological ``magnetic'' charge $g_{\tilde{d}}$, obeying $\kappa {\cal M}_{\tilde{d}} \geq g_{\tilde{d}}/ \sqrt{2}$. In the extreme limit $\kappa {\cal M}_{\tilde{d}}=g_{\tilde{d}}/ \sqrt{2}$, the singularity and event horizon coalesce. For specific values of $D$~and~$d$, these extreme solutions also exhibit supersymmetry and may be identified with previously classified heterotic, Type IIA and Type IIB super $\tilde p$-branes. The theory also admits elementary $p$-brane solutions with ``electric'' Noether charge $e_d$, obeying the Dirac quantization rule $e_d g_{\tilde{d}} = 2\pi n$, $n =$~integer. We also present the Lagrangian describing the theory dual to the original theory, whose antisymmetric tensor has rank $\tilde{d}$ and for which the roles of topological and elementary solutions are interchanged. The super $p$-branes and their duals are mutually non-singular. As special cases of our general solution we recover the black $p$-branes of Horowitz and Strominger $(D = 10)$, Guven $(D = 11)$ and Gibbons et al $(D = 4)$, the $N = 1$, $N = 2a$~and~$N = 2b$ super-$p$-branes of Dabholkar et al $(4 \leq D \leq 10)$, Duff and Stelle $(D = 11)$, Duff and Lu $(D = 10)$ and Callan, Harvey and Strominger $(D = 10)$, and the axionic instanton of Rey $(D = 4)$. In particular, the electric/magnetic duality of Gibbons and Perry in $D = 4$ is seen to be a consequence of particle/sixbrane duality in $D = 10$. Among the new solutions is a self-dual superstring in $D = 6$. "
We consider higher dimensional operators due to quantum gravity or spontaneous compactification of extra dimensions in Kaluza-Klein type theory and their effect in the $SO(10)$ Lagrangian. These operators change the boundary conditions at the unification scale. As a result one can allow left-right symmetry to survive till very low energy (as low as $\sim$ TeV) for a wide range of values for the coupling of these higher dimensional operators and still make the theory compatible with the latest values of $\sin^2 \theta_W$ and $\alpha_s$ derived from LEP. We consider both non-supersymmetric and supersymmetric cases with standard higgses. Proton lifetime is very large in these theories. 
"We show that black holes fulfill the scaling laws arising in critical transitions. In particular, we find that in the transition from negative to positive values the heat capacities $C_{JQ}$, $C_{\Omega Q}$ and $C_{J\Phi}$ give rise to critical exponents satisfying the scaling laws. The three transitions have the same critical exponents as predicted by the universality Hypothesis. We also briefly discuss the implications of this result with regards to the connections among gravitation, quantum mechanics and statistical physics. "
"We consider the stimulated emission of gravitons from an initial state of thermal equilibrium, under the action of the cosmic gravitational background field. We find that the low-energy graviton spectrum is enhanced if compared with spontaneous creation from the vacuum; as a consequence, the scale of inflation must be lowered, in order not to exceed the observed CMB quadrupole anisotropy. This effect is particularly important for models based on a symmetry-breaking transition which require, as initial condition, a state of thermal equilibrium at temperatures of the order of the inflation scale. "
"A spacially extended model of the collective behavior of a large number of locally acting organisms is proposed in which organisms move probabilistically between local cells in space, but with weights dependent on local morphogenetic substances, or morphogens. The morphogens are in turn are effected by the passage of an organism. The evolution of the morphogens, and the corresponding flow of the organisms constitutes the collective behavior of the group. Such models have various types of phase transitions and self-organizing properties controlled both by the level of the noise, and other parameters. The model is then applied to the specific case of ants moving on a lattice. The local behavior of the ants is inspired by the actual behavior observed in the laboratory, and analytic results for the collective behavior are compared to the corresponding laboratory results. It is hoped that the present model might serve as a paradigmatic example of a complex cooperative system in nature. In particular swarm models can be used to explore the relation of nonequilibrium phase transitions to at least three important issues encountered in artificial life. Firstly, that of emergence as complex adaptive behavior. Secondly, as an exploration of continuous phase transitions in biological systems. Lastly, to derive behavioral criteria for the evolution of collective behavior in social organisms. "
"We conduct a numerical study of the dynamic behavior of a dense hard sphere fluid by deriving and integrating a set of Langevin equations. The statics of the system is described by a free energy functional of the Ramakrishnan-Yussouff form. We find that the system exhibits glassy behavior as evidenced through stretched exponential decay and two-stage relaxation of the density correlation function. The characteristic times grow with increasing density according to the Vogel-Fulcher law. The wavenumber dependence of the kinetics is extensively explored. The connection of our results with experiment, mode coupling theory, and molecular dynamics results is discussed. "
"Instanton-like transitions (``shadow processes'') are considered in (1+1) dimensional models with one scalar field whose potential is a quadratic well with a cliff. The corresponding classical boundary value problem is solved, and the semiclassical transition probabilities are found in a rather wide range of energies and the numbers of initial particles. "
"We evaluate the SUSY and top threshold effects in the context of the MSSM and the string derived model based on SU(4)$\times$SU(2)$_L\times$SU(2)$_R$. In both cases we run the two loop RGEs and determine the lower bounds of the supersymmetric particle masses, dictated by the experimentally accepted regions of the values of the low energy parameters. "
"We discuss the kinetics of a disoriented chiral condensate, treated as an open quantum system. We suggest that the problem is analogous to that of a damped harmonic oscillator. Master equations are used to establish a hierarchy of relevant time scales. Some phenomenological consequences are briefly outlined. "
"A Chern-Simons gauged Nonlinear Schr\""odinger Equation is derived from the continuous Heisenberg model in 2+1 dimensions. The corresponding planar magnets can be analyzed whithin the anyon theory. Thus, we show that static magnetic vortices correspond to the self-dual Chern - Simons solitons and are described by the Liouville equation. The related magnetic topological charge is associated with the electric charge of anyons. Furthermore, vortex - antivortex configurations are described by the sinh-Gordon equation and its conformally invariant extension. Physical consequences of these results are discussed. "
"In this paper we review previous work and present new work concerning the relationship between dynamical systems theory and computation. In particular, we review work by Langton \cite{Langton90} and Packard \cite{Packard88} on the relationship between dynamical behavior and computational capability in cellular automata (CA). We present results from an experiment similar to the one described in \cite{Packard88}, that was cited there as evidence for the hypothesis that rules capable of performing complex computations are most likely to be found at a phase transition between ordered and chaotic behavioral regimes for CA (the ``edge of chaos''). Our experiment produced very different results from the original experiment, and we suggest that the interpretation of the original results is not correct. We conclude by discussing general issues related to dynamics, computation, and the ``edge of chaos'' in cellular automata. "
"Recent measurements of gamma rays from the powerful quasar 3C273 by the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory show that a powerful cosmic accelerator must be operating. In this paper the evidence for proton acceleration is collected with the result that (i) the gamma ray spectrum should flatten slightly above a few GeV and that (ii) high energy neutrinos from the decay of photomesons are difficult to observe, although the power carried by these particles is as large as the gamma ray power. However, the power is concentrated at energies in the EeV range, whereas in the TeV-PeV range neutrinos from pp and p$\alpha$ collisions dominate due to their steeper spectrum. Consequently, the flux of cosmic neutrinos from flat spectrum radio sources such as 3C273 in the energy range relevant for proposed underwater or underice detectors could be much lower than inferred from assuming the same spectrum for gamma rays and neutrinos. "
Contributions to HFS and to the Lamb shift intervals of order $\alpha^2(Z\alpha)^5$ induced by graphs with two radiative photons inserted in the electron line are considered. It is demonstrated that this last gauge invariant set of diagrams which are capable of producing corrections of considered order consists of nineteen topologically different diagrams. Contributions both to HFS and Lamb shift induced by graphs containing one-loop electron self-energy as a subgraph and also by the graph containing two one-loop vertices are obtained. 
"Many years ago Weinberg formulated a definition of ``naturalness'' for effective theories: if an effective theory is to make sense, coefficients must not change too much when the cutoff scale is changed by a factor of order 1. As an example, we consider simple field theories in which an $O(N)$ symmetry spontaneously breaks to $O(N-1)$. We show that in these theories Weinberg's criterion for a natural effective theory may be applied directly to the $S$-matrix; it implies that the scale of new physics, beyond the Goldstone bosons, may not be too large: there is always a particle or a cut of mass below or about $4 \pi f / \sqrt{N}$. We discuss the range of convergence of the expansion of the chiral Lagrangian. It appears to be impossible to construct an underlying theory of the type considered here that fails to satisfy Weinberg's criterion. "
"Results of a recent calculation of the effective $\dS$ Hamiltonian at the next-to-leading order will be presented\footnote{Work done in collaboration with A. J. Buras and M. E. Lautenbacher.}. These, together with an improved treatment of hadronic matrix elements, are used to evaluate the measure for direct CP-violation, $\epe$, at the next-to-leading order. Taking $\mt=130\,GeV$, $\Lms=300\,MeV$ and calculating $\langle Q_6 \rangle$ and $\langle Q_8 \rangle$ in the $1/N$ approach, we find in the NDR scheme $\epe = (6.7 \pm 2.6)\times 10^{-4}$ in agreement with the experimental findings of E731. We point out however that the increase of $\langle Q_6 \rangle$ by only a factor of two gives $\epe = (20.0 \pm 6.5)\times 10^{-4}$ in agreement with the result of NA31. The dependencies of $\epe$ on $\Lms$, $\mt$, and some $B$-parameters, parameterizing hadronic matrix elements, are briefly discussed. "
"The contribution to precision electroweak measurements due to TeV physics which couples primarily to the $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons may be parameterized in terms of the three `oblique correction' parameters, S, T and U. We extend this parameterization to physics at much lower energies, $\ge 100$ GeV, and show that in this more general case three more parameters are required (which we call V, W and X). Only two of these appear in neutral-current experiments, while the third new parameter enters into the $W^\pm$ width. "
Combinatorial $B_n$-analogues of Schubert polynomials and corresponding symmetric functions are constructed from an exponential solution of the $B_n$-Yang-Baxter equation that involves the nilCoxeter algebra of the hyperoctahedral group. 
"The method of quantization of magnetic monopoles based on the order-disorder duality existing between the monopole operator and the lagrangian fields is applied to the description of the quantum magnetic monopoles of `t Hooft and Polyakov in the SO(3) Georgi-Glashow model. The commutator of the monopole operator with the magnetic charge is computed explicitly, indicating that indeed the quantum monopole carries $4\pi/g$ units of magnetic charge. An explicit expression for the asymptotic behavior of the monopole correlation function is derived. From this, the mass of the quantum monopole is obtained. The tree-level result for the quantum monopole mass is shown to satisfy the Bogomolnyi bound ($M_{\rm mon} \geq 4 \pi \frac{M}{g^2}$) and to be within the range of values found for the energy of the classical monopole solution. "
"We investigate the sparticle production processes $e\gamma\goto \sele\sz1$ and $\gamma\gamma\goto \sfermion\overline{\sfermion}$ at high energy $e\gamma$ and $\gamma\gamma$ colliders in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). It will be shown that the $e\gamma$ colliders would be more suitable in searching for the heavy selectrons than $ee$ colliders because of the low mass threshold of the process $e\gamma\goto \sele\sz1$. We show that the standard background processes $e\gamma\goto \nu W$ and $eZ$ can be suppressed in terms of initial beam polarization as well as the kinematical cuts on the energy and angle of the final electron. Moreover, it will be argued that the experimental measurements of the cross sections for the processes $e\gamma\goto \sele\sz1$ and $\gamma\gamma\goto \sfb\sf$ could enable us to constrain the basic parameters in the MSSM. This is originated from the simplicity of SUSY parameter dependence of these processes. We also give comments on the stop production at $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders with the longitudinally polarized electron beams. "
"Invited talk at the ``Workshop on Physics and Experiments at Linear e+e- Colliders'', Waikoloa, Hawaii, April 26-30, 1993 (presented by D. Dominici) "
It is demonstrated that any attempt to calculate the perturbative QCD contribution to the pion form factor requires the inclusion of intrinsic transverse momentum besides Sudakov form factors. For momentum transfers of the order of a few GeV the intrinsic transverse momentum leads to a substantial suppression of the perturbative QCD contribution. 
"We address the issue of recovering the time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger equation from quantum gravity in a natural way. To reach this aim it is necessary to understand the nonoccurrence of certain superpositions in quantum gravity. We explore various possible explanations and their relation. These are the delocalisation of interference terms through interaction with irrelevant degrees of freedom (decoherence), gravitational anomalies, and the possibility of $\theta$ states. The discussion is carried out in both the geometrodynamical and connection representation of canonical quantum gravity. "
"All anomaly candidates and the form of the most general invariant local action are given for old and new minimal supergravity, including the cases where additional Yang--Mills and chiral matter multiplets are present. Furthermore nonminimal supergravity is discussed. In this case local supersymmetry itself may be anomalous and some of the corresponding anomaly candidates are given explicitly. The results are obtained by solving the descent equations which contain the consistency equation satisfied by integrands of anomalies and invariant actions. "
"We have searched for high Pt (>40 GeV/c) jet events in ppbar collisions at the Fermilab TEVATRON (S**1/2 = 1800 GeV/c2) which have large pseudo-rapidity differences between the jets and are consistent with zero particle production from the underlying event. Preliminary analysis indicates that a significant fraction of these events with ""voids"" are present. (3 pages of plain text, 7 Figures available on request from the author) "
"The ratio $R_T$ of $K^+-^{12}C$ to $K^+-d$ cross sections has been calculated microscopically using a boson-exchange $KN$ amplitude in which the $\sigma$ and $\omega$ mesons are dressed by the modifications of the Dirac sea in nuclear matter. In spite of the fact that this dressing leads to a scaling of the mesons effective mass in nuclear matter, the effect on the $R_T$ ratio is found to be weak. "
We propose a model independent method to determine $|V_{ub}|$ from the energy spectrum of the charged lepton in inclusive semileptonic $B$ decays. The method includes perturbative QCD corrections as well as nonperturbative ones. 
"In a general superstring vacuum configuration, the `internal' space (sector) varies in spacetime. When this variation is non-trivial only in two space-like dimensions, the vacuum contains static cosmic strings with finite energy per unit length and which is, up to interactions with matter, an easily computed topological invariant. The total spacetime is smooth although the `internal' space is singular at the center of each cosmic string. In a similar analysis of the Wick-rotated Euclidean model, these cosmic strings acquire expected self-interactions. Also, a possibility emerges to define a global time in order to rotate back to the Lorentzian case. "
"Using cosmological $N$-body simulations and the void probability function (VPF), we investigate the statistical properties of voids within a wide range of initially Gaussian models for the origin of large-scale structure. We pay particular attention to the ability of the VPF to diagnose `biased galaxy formation': the preferential formation of galaxies in regions of high background density and corresponding suppression of galaxy formation in regions of low background density. Biased models have systematically higher VPFs than unbiased models, but for a given biasing scheme the VPF is relatively insensitive to the value of the bias factor $b$. Thus, while the VPF can distinguish unbiased models from some biased models, it is probably not a useful way to constrain the bias factor; uncertainties in the appropriate choice of biasing prescription overwhelm the mild dependence on $b$. We compare the predictions of our models to the most extensive VPF observations published to date. These data do {\it not} require strong biasing; Gaussian models in which galaxies trace mass can reproduce the VPF data to within the errors expected from the current finite volume fluctuations. Models with the moderate biasing predicted by cosmological simulations with gas dynamics yield a slightly better match to the data. Models in which galaxy formation is strongly suppressed in low density regions produce an excess of large, empty voids. "
"A lattice calculation of the pseudoscalar decay constant of heavy-light mesons is reported. Results are obtained (in the quenched approximation) from lattices at $\beta=6.3$ through a procedure that interpolates between the static approximation of Eichten and the conventional (""heavy"" Wilson fermion) method. The previously observed discrepancy between these two approaches has been resolved: we find the scaling quantity $f\sqrt{M}$ to be significantly smaller than previous calculations had indicated ({\it e.g.} at $\beta=6.0$); in addition, we discuss a modification which is required in normalizing the conventional amplitude to correct for large-$am$ lattice errors. This change guarantees that $f\sqrt{M}$ will smoothly approach its value in the static limit. From the numerical interpolation of the static and intermediate-mass results, we find, in units of MeV, $f_B=187(10)\pm34\pm15$, $f_{B_s}=207(9)\pm34\pm22$, $f_D=208(9)\pm35\pm12$ and $f_{D_s}=230(7)\pm30\pm18$, where the first error is statistical and the second two are estimates of systematics due to 1) fitting and large-$am$ effects and 2) scaling. In addition, using lattices at $\beta=6.3$, $\beta=6.0$ and $\beta=5.7$ and extrapolating to the limit of zero lattice spacing, we have computed $f_K/f_\pi = 1.08\pm.03\pm.08$ in the quenched approximation. "
"In this paper we consider a geometric variant of Hofer's symplectic energy, which was first considered by Eliashberg and Hofer in connection with their study of the extent to which the interior of a region in a symplectic manifold determines its boundary. We prove, by a simple geometric argument, that both versions of energy give rise to genuine norms on all symplectic manifolds. Roughly speaking, we show that if there were a symplectomorphism of $M$ which had ""too little"" energy, one could embed a large ball into a thin cylinder $M \times B^2$. Thus there is a direct geometric relation between symplectic rigidity and energy. The second half of the paper is devoted to a proof of the Non-Squeezing theorem for an arbitrary manifold $M$. We do not need to restrict to manifolds in which the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves behaves well. This is of interest since most other deep results in symplectic topology are generalised from Euclidean space to other manifolds by using this theory, and hence are still not known to be valid for arbitrary symplectic manifolds. "
"Some bright cD galaxies in cluster cooling flows have Thomson optical depths exceeding 0.01. A few percent of their luminosity is scattered and appears as diffuse polarized emission. We calculate the scattering process for different geometric combinations of luminosity sources and scattering media. We apply our results to galaxies, with and without active nuclei, immersed in cooling flows. We model observations of NGC 1275 and M87 (without active nuclei) in the presence of sky and galactic background fluxes which hinder the measurement of the scattered light at optical wavelengths. Current instruments are unable to detect the scattered light from such objects. However, when a galaxy has an active nucleus of roughly the same luminosity as the remainder of the galaxy in V, both the total and polarized scattered intensity should observable on large scales (5--30kpc), meaning intensity levels greater than 1% of the background level. For typical AGN and galaxy spectral distributions, the scattering is most easily detected at short (U) wavelengths. We point out that a number of such cases will occur. We show that the radiation pattern from the central nuclear region can be mapped using the scattering. We also show that the scattered light can be used to measure inhomogeneities in the cooling flow. "
"We assume that strong and electroweak interactions become strong at very high energies. With this assumption, we compute the low-energy gauge coupling constants $\alpha_i (m_Z)$ as a function of the cutoff scale, taking the supersymmetric standard model with $3+2n$ families of quark and lepton multiplets. We find that only the five family case $(n=1)$ is consistent with the experimental values of the gauge coupling constants. This suggests the presence of a pair of families at $\sim 1$~TeV. "
"We consider a supersymmetric version of the recently proposed SU(3) X U(1) extended gauge model. We show that it is possible to have only two Higgs doublets at the SU(2) X U(1) energy scale but they are not those of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. In particular, the upper bound on the lightest scalar boson of this model is $4 M_Z \sin \theta_W$ at tree level and goes up to 189 GeV after radiative corrections. "
"It is shown that the finite dimensional irreducible representations of the quantum matrix algebra $ M_q(n) $ ( the coordinate ring of $ GL_q(n) $ ) exist only when q is a root of unity ( $ q^p = 1 $ ). The dimensions of these representations can only be one of the following values: $ {p^N \over 2^k } $ where $ N = {n(n-1)\over 2 } $ and $ k \in \{ 0, 1, 2, . . . N \} $ For each $ k $ the topology of the space of states is $ (S^1)^{\times(N-k)} \times [ 0 , 1 ] ^{(\times (k)} $ (i.e. an $ N $ dimensional torus for $ k=0 $ and an $ N $ dimensional cube for $ k = N $ ). "
"After reviewing some aspects of gravity in two dimensions, it is shown that non-trivial embeddings of sl(2) in a semi-simple (super) Lie algebra give rise to a very large class of extensions of 2D gravity. The induced action is constructed as a gauged WZW model and an exact expression for the effective action is given. (Talk presented at the Journees Relativistes '93, Brussels, April, 1993). "
"It is argued that the transparency of a medium for passage of a nucleon, knocked-out in a semi-inclusive $(e,e'p)$ reaction and subsequently scattered elastically, is not the same as the one measured in purely elastic scattering. Expressions are given for the properly generalized transparency and those are compared with recently proposed, alternative suggestions. Numerical results are presented for selected nuclear targets and kinematic conditions, applying to the Garino et al and the SLAC NE18 experiment. "
"We use separation of variables as a tool to identify and to analyze exactly soluble time-dependent quantum mechanical potentials. By considering the most general possible time-dependent re-definition of the spatial coordinate, as well as general transformations on the wavefunctions, we show that separation of variables applies and exact solubility occurs only in a very restricted class of time-dependent models. We consider the formal structure underlying our findings, and the relationship between our results and other work on time-dependent potentials. As an application of our methods, we apply our results to the calculations of propagators. "
"Nearby starburst galaxies have consistently shown anomalous Ly-alpha/H-beta ratios. By re-analysing the published IUE/optical observations, we show that most starbursts present a normal Ly-alpha emission, consistent with case B recombination theory, provided extinction laws appropriate to their metallicities are used. This implies that extinction is more important than multiple resonant scattering effects. The anomalous emission and absorption lines present in a few remaining galaxies are simply explained if they are observed in the post-burst phase, between about 10$^7$ and 10$^8$ yrs after the start of the burst. We use updated stellar population synthesis models to show that anomalous ratios are produced by the aging of stellar populations, since the underlying stellar Ly-alpha line is important in the cooler massive stars. The inferred low-duty cycle of massive star formation accounts naturally for the failure to detect large numbers of Ly-alpha--emitting galaxies in deep surveys and at high redshift. Some testable predictions of the proposed scenario are also discussed. "
"Recent work on $N=2$ supersymmetric Bianchi type IX cosmologies coupled to a scalar field is extended to a general treatment of homogeneous quantum cosmologies with explicitely solvable momentum constraints, i.e. Bianchi types I, II, VII, VIII besides the Bianchi type IX, and special cases, namely the Friedmann universes, the Kantowski-Sachs space, and Taub-NUT space. Besides the earlier explicit solution of the Wheeler DeWitt equation for Bianchi type IX, describing a virtual wormhole fluctuation, an additional explicit solution is given and identified with the `no-boundary state'. "
The rate of emission of heavy dileptons from QGP is found without an assumption of its complete thermal equilibrium. We base on the real-time quantum field kinetic approach [1] and use the expansion up to the second order with respect to strong coupling constant $g$. The final answer is not free from the collinear singularities and we show that this is the actual issue. As a result the main contribution to the rate of the heavy dileptons production at $M/T \sim 10$ comes from the process $q\bar{q}g\rightarrow \gamma^{*}$. ( Figures can be obtained from the author ) 
A simple two-level model is developed and used to test the properties of effective interactions for performing nuclear structure calculations in truncated model spaces. It is shown that the effective many-body interactions sensitively depend on the choice of the single-particle basis and they appear to be minimized when a self- consistent Hartree-Fock basis is used. 
"We demonstrate that expected efficiencies and purities for $b$-tagging at SSC/LHC detectors may allow detection of the Standard Model Higgs in $t\anti t \hsm$ production, with $\hsm\rta b\anti b$ decay, for $80\lsim\mhsm\lsim 130\gev$, provided $\mt\gsim 130\gev$. "
"We perform the complete bosonization of 2+1 dimensional QED with one fermionic flavor in the Hamiltonian formalism. The Fermi operators are explicitly constructed in terms of the vector potential and the electric field. We carefully specify the regularization procedure involved in the definition of these operators, and calculate the fermionic bilinears and the energy - momentum tensor. The algebra of bilinears exhibits the Schwinger terms which also appear in perturbation theory. The bosonic Hamiltonian is a local, polynomial functional of $A_i$ and $E_i$, and we check explicitly the Lorentz invariance of the resulting bosonic theory. Our construction is conceptually very similar to Mandelstam's construction in 1+1 dimensions, and is dissimilar from the recent bosonization attempts in 2+1 dimensions, which hinge crucially on the presence of a Chern - Simons term. "
"In this paper the $c=1$ matrix model deformed by a $1/x^{2}$ piece is discussed. Tachyon correlation functions are calculated up to genus two using methods similar to those for the undeformed case. The possible connection with the two dimensional black hole is also considered. In particular, restrictions on naked singularities imposed by the matrix model are found. "
"Gardner's analysis of the optimal storage capacity of neural networks is extended to study finite-temperature effects. The typical volume of the space of interactions is calculated for strongly-diluted networks as a function of the storage ratio $\alpha$, temperature $T$, and the tolerance parameter $m$, from which the optimal storage capacity $\alpha_c$ is obtained as a function of $T$ and $m$. At zero temperature it is found that $\alpha_c = 2$ regardless of $m$ while $\alpha_c$ in general increases with the tolerance at finite temperatures. We show how the best performance for given $\alpha$ and $T$ is obtained, which reveals a first-order transition from high-quality performance to low-quality one at low temperatures. An approximate criterion for recalling, which is valid near $m=1$, is also discussed. "
We elaborate on the production of the Standard Model Higgs particle at high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders through the reaction $e^+e^- \rightarrow ZH$. Particular emphasis is put on the intermediate mass range. In addition to the signal we discuss in detail the background processes. Angular distributions which are sensitive to the spin and parity of the Higgs particle are analyzed. 
"We prove that mu = mu^{< mu}, 2^mu = mu^+ and ``there is a non reflecting stationary subset of mu^+ composed of ordinals of cofinality < mu'' imply that there is a mu-complete Souslin tree on mu^+ . "
Quantum multiparameter deformation of real Clifford algebras is proposed. The corresponding irreducible representations are found. 
"The chiral phase dependence of fermion partition function in spherically symmetric U(1) gauge field background is analyzed in two dimensional space-time. A well-defined method to calculated the path integral which apply to the continuous fermion spectrum is described. The one-to-one correspondence between the nonzero energy continuous spectra of two pertinent hamiltonians, which are defined by the Dirac operator to make the path integral well-defined, is shown to be exact. The asymptotic expansion for the chiral phase dependence in \(1/|m|^2\) (\(m\) is mass of the fermion.) is proposed and the coefficients in the expansion are evaluated up to the next-to-next leading term. Up to this order, the chiral phase dependence is given only by the winding number of background field and the corrections vanish. "
"We consider an alternative to conventional GUTs originally proposed by Maiani, Parisi and Petronzio, where owing to the existence of extra fermion generations at some intermediate scale, the gauge couplings become large at high energies. We first comment on how the non- supersymmetric version of this scenario is ruled out; we then consider the two-loop evolution of the couplings in the supersymmetric extension of this scenario, and check whether such a scenario is feasible in the light of the precies values of couplings now available from LEP. "

"In this article we present all nonsingular upper triangular solutions to the constant quantum Yang-Baxter equation $R_{j_1j_2}^{k_1k_2}R_{k_1j_3}^{l_1k_3}R_{k_2k_3}^{l_2l_3}= R_{j_2j_3}^{k_2k_3}R_{j_1k_3}^{k_1l_3}R_{k_1k_2}^{l_1l_2}$ in the three state case, i.e. all indices ranging from 1 to 3. The upper triangular ansatz implies 729 equations for 45 variables. Fortunately many of the equations turned out to be simple allowing us to start breaking the problem into smaller ones. In the end we had a total of 552 solutions, but many of them were either inherited from two-state solutions or subcases of others. The final list contains 35 nontrivial solutions, most of them new. "
Using the general framework of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics for relativistic quantum field systems we derive the basic equations of quantum field kinetics. The main aim of the approach is calculation of observables associated with quark-gluon plasma which is out of thermal and chemical equilibrium. We show that in the regime of high rate of the phase and statistical mixing the perturbation theory for many-body quantum field system should have the form which much differs from the standard expansion in powers of coupling constant.

"If ZFC is consistent, then each of the following are consistent with ZFC + 2^{{aleph_0}}= aleph_2 : 1.) X subseteq R is of strong measure zero iff |X| <= aleph_1 + there is a generalized Sierpinski set. 2.) The union of aleph_1 many strong measure zero sets is a strong measure zero set + there is a strong measure zero set of size aleph_2. "
We calculate the rate of the emission of the photons from the QGP. We base on the real-time kinetic approach [1] without an explicit assumption about a complete thermal equilibrium in the emitting system. ( Figures can be obtained from the author ) 
"We introduce a model for a sandpile, with N sites, critical height N and each site connected to every other site. It is thus a mean-field model in the spin-glass sense. We find an exact solution for the steady state probability distribution of avalanche sizes, and discuss its asymptotics for large N. "
We speculate about a heavy bottom-charm six-quark baryon. A semiclassical and a gaussian estimate reveal that the octet-octet bbb-ccc configuration can be energetically favored with respect to the singlet-singlet one. This result suggests that a confined bbb-ccc six-quark state may exist. Such objects may be produced in appreciable amount in heavy ion collisions at LHC energies. 
"We present a formulation of Quantum Electrodynamics in terms of an antisymmetric tensor gauge field. In this formulation the topological current of this field appears as a source for the electromagnetic field and the topological charge therefore acts physically as an electric charge. The charged states of QED lie in the sector where the topological charge is identical to the matter charge. The antisymmetric field theory, however, admits new sectors where the topological charge is more general. These nontrivial, electrically charged, sectors contain massless states orthogonal to the vacuum which are created by a gauge invariant operator and can be interpreted as coherent states of photons. We evaluate the correlation functions of these states in the absence of matter. The new states have a positive definite norm and do interact with the charged states of QED in the usual way. It is argued that if these new sectors are in fact realized in nature then a very intense background electromagnetic field is necessary for the experimental observation of them. The order of magnitude of the intensity threshold is estimated. "
"We study the synchronous and asynchronous automatic structures on the fundamental group of a graph of groups in which each edge group is finite. Up to a natural equivalence relation, the set of biautomatic structures on such a graph product bijects to the product of the sets of biautomatic structures on the vertex groups. The set of automatic structures is much richer. Indeed, it is dense in the infinite product of the sets of automatic structures of all conjugates of the vertex groups. We classify these structures by a class of labelled graphs which ``mimic"" the underlying graph of the graph of groups. Analogous statements hold for asynchronous automatic structures. We also discuss the boundaries of these structures. "
"The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interference patterns in ring-shaped conductors are usually dominated by random features. The amplitude of the oscillations is random from sample to sample and from point to point on the magnetic field axis owing to random scattering of the electron trajectories by impurities within the wires. We report experiments on new devices made with wet etching and global gates, which have shown major progress towards removing the random features. In loops that exhibit ballistic conductance plateaux and cyclotron orbit trapping at $4.2K$, the random pattern of AB oscillations (observed for $T < 0.1K$) can be replaced by much more ordered one -- especially if only a few transverse modes are populated in the ring. The amplitude and shape of the oscillation envelope function change systematically as subbands are populated in the wires forming the loops. Mechanisms governing the AB effect in the ballistic regime are discussed. Correlation has been found between the $G(V_{g},B=0)$ staircase and the ``beating period"" of the envelope functions. Quantum oscillations in $G(V_{g},B = 0)$ are consistent with direct interference of paths of unequal length. Both the correlations and the quantum oscillations in gate voltage are signatures of ballistic transport. "

"The fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation may contain deviations from gaussian statistics which would be reflected in a nonzero value of three-point correlation function of $\Delta T$. However, any potential observation of the three-point function is limited by cosmic variance, even if a whole-sky map of $\Delta T$ is available. Here I derive a general formula for the cosmic variance of the three-point function in terms of integrals over the two-point function. This formula can be applied to any cosmological model and to any experimental measurement strategy. It gives a fundamental lower limit on the magnitude of a measurable three-point correlation function, and hence on the measurable amount of skewness in the distribution of $\Delta T$. "
"The chiral and heavy quark symmetries of QCD are reviewed. These symmetries are used to predict some low-momentum properties of hadrons containing a single heavy quark. (Lectures given at the CCAST Symposium on Particle Physics at the Fermi Scale May27-June4,1993) "
"The NLC may allow us to search for the `inverse' process to neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay, $e^-e^-\to W^-W^-$, which probes the existence of Majorana masses for neutrinos. Expectations for the observation of this process in both the Standard Model and its extension, the Left-Right Symmetric Model, are examined.

Using the recently proposed density matrix renormalization group technique we show that the magnons in the S=1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain effectively behaves as bosons that condense at a critical field h_c. 
"If $M$ is a closed Nil geometry 3-manifold then $\pi_1(M)$ is almost convex with respect to a fairly simple ``geometric'' generating set. If $G$ is a central extension or a ${\Bbb Z}$-extension of a word hyperbolic group, then $G$ is also almost convex with respect to some generating set. Combining these with previously known results shows that if $M$ is a closed 3-manifold with one of Thurston's eight geometries, $\pi_1(M)$ is almost convex with respect to some generating set if and only if the geometry in question is not Sol.

"Random sequential adsorption with diffusional relaxation, of two by two square objects on the two-dimensional square lattice is studied by Monte Carlo computer simulation. Asymptotically for large lattice sizes, diffusional relaxation allows the deposition process to reach full coverage. The coverage approaches the full occupation value, 1, as a power-law with convergence exponent near 1/2. For a periodic lattice of finite (even) size $L$, the final state is a frozen random rectangular grid of domain walls connecting single-site defects. The domain sizes saturate at L**0.8. Prior to saturation, i.e., asymptotically for infinite lattice, the domain growth is power-law with growth exponent near, or possibly somewhat smaller than, 1/2. "
"We discuss the canonical treatment and quantization of matter coupled supergravity in three dimensions, with special emphasis on $N=2$ supergravity. We then analyze the quantum constraint algebra; certain operator ordering ambiguities are found to be absent due to local supersymmetry. We show that the supersymmetry constraints can be partially solved by a functional analog of the method of characteristics. We also consider extensions of Wilson loop integrals of the type previously found in ordinary gravity, but now with connections involving the bosonic and fermionic matter fields in addition to the gravitational connection. In a separate section of this paper, the canonical treatment and quantization of non-linear coset space sigma models are discussed in a self contained way. "
"The influence of charging effects on time-dependent transport in small semiconductor quantum dots with arbitrary level spectra is studied. Starting from an explicit time-dependent tunneling Hamiltonian, a non-Markovian Master equation is derived which is also valid in the nonlinear response regime. The many-body nonequilibrium distribution functions of the dot are calculated and the I-V characteristic of the structure including the displacement currents is obtained. New resonant features show up in the Coulomb oscillations and in the Coulomb staircase, and a new possibility to realize electronic pumps is described. "
"I discuss the absorption and dispersion of pions in hot matter. A two-loop calculation in the framework of chiral perturbation theory is presented and its result is compactly written in terms of the two- and three-particle forward $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitudes. At modest temperatures, $T \le 100$ MeV, the change in the pion mass is small and its dispersion law closely resembles the free space one. At these temperatures, all quantities of interest are given to a good degree of accuracy by the first term in the virial expansion which is linear in the density. (BUTP-93/16, uses espcrc1.sty from North-Holland Publishing) "
Abelian anomaly is examined by means of the recently proposed gauge invariant regularization for SO(10) chiral gauge theory and its generalization for a theory of arbitrary gauge group with anomaly-free chiral fermion contents. For both cases it is shown that the anomaly with correct normalization can be obtained in a gauge invariant form without any counterterms. 
"We have performed an exhaustive search for Gribov copies on the lattice and their possible dependence from finite temperature effects. We show that, for each value of lattice size, Gribov copies are dense in configuration space at low temperature but their density tend to lower when the temperature increases. We have investigated lattice sizes running from $16^3\times 8$ to $16^4$. "
"We present a new method for extracting the true 3-d velocity and density fields from the nonlinear redshift--space projected density field. The method is based on the nonlinear, nonlocal transformation of the density field. We assume a curl--free velocity field, although in the formulation presented here this assumption can be dropped. Toy models with special symmetry are used to test the intrinsic accuracy of the method compared to linear theory. Finding significant improvement we then test the method in more detail on N--body simulations, considering the problems associated with sampling the density field using sparse, magnitude--limited galaxy redshift surveys. A method of estimating the magnitude of shot--noise effects on the deprojected velocity field is derived. We find there is a good correlation between the true and deprojected density and velocity fields, even in the mildly nonlinear regime, provided that on large scales galaxies trace the mass. An initial application is made to the IRAS--QDOT all--sky redshift survey. "
We describe our 3-dimensional numerical relativity code for the evolution of inhomogeneous cosmologies. During the evolution the constraint equations are monitored but not solved. The code has been tested against perturbation theory with good results. We present some runs of inhomogeneous inflation with strongly inhomogeneous initial data. 
"The lattice Boltzmann equation describes the evolution of the velocity distribution function on a lattice in a manner that macroscopic fluid dynamical behavior is recovered. Although the equation is a derivative of lattice gas automata, it may be interpreted as a Lagrangian finite-difference method for the numerical simulation of the discrete-velocity Boltzmann equation that makes use of a BGK collision operator. As a result, it is not surprising that numerical instability of lattice Boltzmann methods have been frequently encountered by researchers. We present an analysis of the stability of perturbations of the particle populations linearized about equilibrium values corresponding to a constant-density uniform mean flow. The linear stability depends on the following parameters: the distribution of the mass at a site between the different discrete speeds, the BGK relaxation time, the mean velocity, and the wavenumber of the perturbations. This parameter space is too large to compute the complete stability characteristics. We report some stability results for a "
"We have analyzed the 241 bursts for which peak counts $\C$ exist in the publicly available Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) catalog. Introducing peak counts in 1024 ms as a measure of burst brightness $\B$ and the ratio of peak counts in 64 and 1024 ms as a measure of short timescale variability $\V$, we find a statistically significant correlation between the brightness and the short timescale variability of \g-ray bursts. The bursts which are smoother on short timescales are both faint and bright, while the bursts which are variable on short timescales are faint only, suggesting the existence of two distinct morphological classes of bursts. "
"Anisimov and Seifert show that a group has a regular word problem ifand only if it is finite. Muller and Schupp (together with Dunwoody's accessibility result) show that a group has context free word problem if and only if it is virtually free. In this note, we exhibit a class of groups where the word problem is as close as possible to being a context sensitive language. This class includes the automatic groups and is closed under passing to finitely generated subgroups. Consequently, it is quite large, including many groups which are not finitely presented. "
"Three postulates asserting the validity of conventional quantum theory, semi-classical general relativity and the statistical basis for thermodynamics are introduced as a foundation for the study of black hole evolution. We explain how these postulates may be implemented in a ``stretched horizon'' or membrane description of the black hole, appropriate to a distant observer. The technical analysis is illustrated in the simplified context of 1+1 dimensional dilaton gravity. Our postulates imply that the dissipative properties of the stretched horizon arise from a course graining of microphysical degrees of freedom that the horizon must possess. A principle of black hole complementarity is advocated. The overall viewpoint is similar to that pioneered by 't~Hooft but the detailed implementation is different. "
"R.P. Feynman showed F.J. Dyson a proof of the Lorentz force law and the homogeneous Maxwell equations, which he obtained starting from Newton's law of motion and the commutation relations between position and velocity for a single nonrelativistic particle. We formulate both a special relativistic and a general relativistic versions of Feynman's derivation. Especially in the general relativistic version we prove that the only possible fields that can consistently act on a quantum mechanical particle are scalar, gauge and gravitational fields. We also extend Feynman's scheme to the case of non-Abelian gauge theory in the special relativistic context. "
"The initial value problem for the Vlasov-Poisson system is by now well understood in the case of an isolated system where, by definition, the distribution function of the particles as well as the gravitational potential vanish at spatial infinity. Here we start with homogeneous solutions, which have a spatially constant, non-zero mass density and which describe the mass distribution in a Newtonian model of the universe. These homogeneous states can be constructed explicitly, and we consider deviations from such homogeneous states, which then satisfy a modified version of the Vlasov-Poisson system. We prove global existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to the corresponding initial value problem for initial data which represent spatially periodic deviations from homogeneous states. "
Exact wavefunctions for N non-Abelian Chern-Simons (NACS) particles are obtained by the ladder operator approach. The same method has previously been applied to construct exact wavefunctions for multi-anyon systems. The two distinct base states of the NACS particles that we use are multi-valued and are defined in terms of path ordered line integrals. Only strings of operators that preserve the monodromy properties of these base states are allowed to act on them to generate new states. 
"A microscopic picture of electron-electron pair scattering in single mode quantum wires is introduced which includes electron spin. A new source of `excess' noise for hot carriers is presented. We show that zero magnetic field `spin' splitting in quantum wires can lead to a dramatic `spin'-subband dependence of electron--electron scattering, including the possibility of strong suppression. As a consequence extremely long electron coherence lengths and new spin-related phenomena are predicted. Since electron bands in III-V semiconductor quantum wires are in general spin-split in zero applied magnetic field, these new transport effects are of general importance. "
"Classical and nonclassical symmetries of the nonlinear heat equation $$u_t=u_{xx}+f(u),\eqno(1)$$ are considered. The method of differential Gr\""obner bases is used both to find the conditions on $f(u)$ under which symmetries other than the trivial spatial and temporal translational symmetries exist, and to solve the determining equations for the infinitesimals. A catalogue of symmetry reductions is given including some new reductions for the linear heat equation and a catalogue of exact solutions of (1) for cubic $f(u)$ in terms of the roots of $f(u)=0$. "
"We study the large N limit of the Itzykson -- Zuber integral and show that the leading term is given by the exponent of an action functional for the complex inviscid Burgers (Hopf) equation evaluated on its particular classical solution; the eigenvalue densities that enter in the IZ integral being the imaginary parts of the boundary values of this solution. We show how this result can be applied to ``induced QCD"" with an arbitrary potential $U(x)$. We find that for a nonsingular $U(x)$ in one dimension the eigenvalue density $\rho(x)$ at the saddle point is the solution of the functional equation $G_{+}(G_{-}(x))=G_{-}(G_{+}(x))=x$, where $G_{\pm}(x) \equiv {1\over{2}}U^{\prime}(x)\pm i\pi \rho(x)$. As an illustration we present a number of new particular solutions of the $c=1$ matrix model on a discrete real line. "
"In a previous paper two of the authors (G. R. and A. D. R.) showed that there exist global, classical solutions of the spherically symmetric Vlasov-Einstein system for small initial data. The present paper continues this investigation and allows also large initial data. It is shown that if a solution of the spherically symmetric Vlasov-Einstein system develops a singularity at all then the first singularity has to appear at the center of symmetry. The result adds weight to the conjecture that cosmic censorship holds if one replaces dust as matter model for which naked singularities do form by a collisionless gas described by the Vlasov equation. The main tool is an estimate which shows that a solution is global if all the matter remains away from the center of symmetry. "
"We examine a hot pion gas by including medium modifications of the two-body scattering amplitude as well as mean-field effects selfconsistently. In contrast to earlier calculations, the in-medium T-matrix is rather close to the free one while the mean-field potential agrees well with lowest-order estimates. We also discuss the validity of the quasiparticle approximation. It is found that it is reliable for temperatures up to $\sim 150$ MeV. Above this temperature off-shell effects in the pion selfenergy become important, especially if the pions are strongly out of chemical equilibrium. "
"In a recent article, Kim and Overhauser [Phys. Rev. B 47, 8025 (1993)] have found fault with the theory of impure superconductors by Abrikosov and Gor'kov and have proposed an alternative formalism based on Green's functions which are not derivable from a Dyson equation. Although the corrections to the Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory found by Kim and Overhauser are correct for non-retarded interactions, I argue that these corrections do not appear when one treats realistic retarded interactions within the field-theoretic approach of Abrikosov and Gor'kov. Direct numerical computation of the impurity-induced suppression of the superconducting transition temperature Tc for both retarded and non-retarded interactions illustrates these points. I conclude that Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory applied to physical electron-electron interactions yields a tractable formalism which accurately predicts the effects of magnetic and non-magnetic impurities on Tc.

"We introuduce a unified method which can be applied to any WZW model at arbitrary level to search systematically for modular invariant physical partition functions. Our method is based essentially on modding out a known theory on group manifold $G$ by a discrete group $\Gamma$. We apply our method to $\widehat {su(n)}$ with $n=2,3,4,5,6$, and to $\widehat {g_2}$ models, and obtain all the known partition functions and some new ones, and give explicit expressions for all of them.

"We review some recent results and future prospects in the phenomenology of Supersymmmetry. We discuss the searches for superpartner states, the searches for Higgs bosons in the minimal SUSY model, and additional parameter constraints arising in SUSY-GUT models. "
"In the present article, using a further generalization of the algebraic method of separation of variables, the Dirac equation is separated in a family of space-times where it is not possible to find a complete set of first order commuting differential operators. After separating variables, the Dirac equation is reduced to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and some exact solutions corresponding to cosmological backgrounds and gravitational waves are computed in terms of hypergeometric functions. By passing, the Klein Gordon equation in this background field is discussed. "
"We apply CGHS-type dilaton gravity model to (1+1)-dimensional cosmological situations. First the behavior of a compact 1-dimensional universe (i.e. like a closed string) is classified on the assumption of homogeneity of universe. Several interesting solutions are found, which include a Misner-type universe having closed time-like curves, and an asymptotically de Sitter universe first pointed out by Yoshimura. In the second half of this talk, we discuss the modification of the classical homogeneous solutions, considering inhomogeneity of classical conformal matters and also quantum back-reaction respectively. (An expanded version of the talk presented by T. Mishima at Yukawa Institute of Theoretical Physics workshop `Quantum Gravity' 24-27, November 1992.) "
An alternative to Dirac's constrained quantization procedure is explained. 
"We construct a lattice model of compact (2+1)-dimensional Maxwell-Chern- Simons theory, starting from its formulation in terms of gauge invariant quantities proposed by Deser and Jackiw. We thereby identify the topological excitations and their interactions. These consist of monopolo- antimonopole pairs bounded by strings carrying both magnetic flux and electric charge. The electric charge renders the Dirac strings observable and endows them with a finite energy per unit length, which results in a linearly confining string tension. Additionally, the strings interact via an imaginary, topological term measuring the (self-) linking number of closed strings. "
"We present an alternative 2-parametric deformation $ GL(2)_{h,h'} $ , and construct the differential calculus on the quantum plane on which this quantum group acts. Also we give a new deformation of the two dimensional Heisenberg algebra "
"As a first step towards constructing chiral models on the lattice with staggered fermions, we study a U(1) model with axial-vector coupling to an external gauge field in two dimensions. In our approach gauge invariance is broken, but it is restored in the classical continuum limit. We find that the continuum divergence relations for the vector and axial-vector currents are reproduced, up to contact terms, which we determine analytically. The current divergence relations are also studied numerically for smooth external gauge fields with topological charge zero. We furthermore investigate the effect of fluctuating gauge transformations and of gauge configurations with non-trivial topological charge. "
"After pointing out the role of the compactification lattice for spectrum calculations in orbifold models, I discuss modular discrete symmetry groups for $Z_N$ or\-bi\-folds. I consider the $Z_7$ orbifold as a nontrivial example of a (2,2) model and give the generators of the modular group for this case, which does not contain $[SL(2,{\bf Z})]^3$ as had been speculated. I also discuss how to treat cases where quantized Wilson lines are present. I consider in detail an example, demonstrating that quantized Wilson lines affect the modular group in a nontrivial manner. In particular, I show that it is possible for a Wilson line to break $SL(2,{\bf Z})$.} "
"Effects of the dense matter can induce the neutrino decay even if neutrinos are stable in vacuum. This is due to coherent interactions with matter which lead to energy level-splitting between the neutrino and antineutrino states and thereby provide available phase space for the majoron emission. We show that the matter induced decay can be a plausible candidate for the explanation of solar neutrino deficit, provided that there exist new flavour-changing weak range interactions of neutrino with matter constituents, and constant of $\tau$-neutrino coupling to the majoron is sufficiently large. This mechanism naturally implies the hierarchy between the ratios Z=(measured signal)/(SSM expectation) for Ga-Ge, nu_e-e scattering and Cl-Ar experiments - Z_{GA}>Z_{K}>Z_{Cl}. The important feature of the matter induced decay is the prediction of solar antineutrino flux with substantially degraded energy spectrum compared to solar neutrinos. This scenario can be unambiguously tested by future solar neutrino detectors BOREXINO/BOREX and SNO. "
We report on a study of the autocorrelation times of the local version of the Hybrid Monte Carlo (LHMC) algorithm for pure gauge $SU(3)$. We compare LHMC to standard multi-hit Metropolis and to the global version of the same HMC. For every algorithm we measure the autocorrelation time for a variety of observables and the string tension as a function of beta. The measurements performed on 8^4 and 16^4 lattices indicate that the autocorrelation time of LHMC is significantly shorter than for the other two algorithms. 
"We report on a high statistics simulation of SU(2) pure gauge field theory at finite temperature, using Symanzik action. We determine the critical coupling for the deconfinement phase transition on lattices up to 8 x 24, using Finite Size Scaling techniques. We find that the pattern of asymptotic scaling violation is essentially the same as the one observed with conventional, not improved action. On the other hand, the use of effective couplings defined in terms of plaquette expectation values shows a precocious scaling, with respect to an analogous analysis of data obtained by the use of Wilson action, which we interpret as an effect of improvement.

"In the high temperature phase of Yang-Mills theories, large spatial Wilson loops show area law behaviour with a string tension that grows with increasing temperature. Within the framework of the commonly used string picture we use a large scale expansion, which allows us to determine the string tension from measurements of intermediate and symmetric Wilson loops. "
"We have selected an all--sky sample of 893 galaxies from the IRAS FSC--2, defined by a total (ADDSCAN) 12um flux limit of 0.22~Jy. Completeness is verified to 0.30~Jy, below which we have quantified the incompleteness down to 0.22~Jy for our statistical analysis. \P The Seyfert subsample is the largest unbiased sample of (118) Seyfert galaxies ever assembled and is complete not only to 0.30~Jy at 12um, but also with respect to a bolometric flux limit of $\sim2.0\times10^{-10}$~(cgs). The average $V/V_{max}$ for the full sample, corrected for incompleteness at low fluxes, is $0.51\pm0.04$, while that for Seyferts is $0.46\pm0.10$, suggesting that several Seyferts are yet to be identified in our sample. The AGN luminosity functions (LFs) are more complete than those of the optically selected CfA Seyfert galaxies for all luminosities and AGN types. \P The 60um LF for a complete 60um--flux--limited (at 8.3~Jy) subsample of 235 galaxies is in satisfactory agreement with those derived from the bright galaxy sample (BGS) and the deep high--galactic latitude sample, both selected at 60um. Over the high lum. range where our sample and the BGS overlap, however, our space densities are systematically lower by a factor of $\sim 1.5$, whereas at low lum. our space densities are higher by about the same amount. Comparable results are obtained when comparing the far--IR LF of our entire sample with the one derived from the BGS. This is not unexpected, because of the bias towards high-luminosity spirals caused by selection at 60um. "
The method of geometrical quantization of symplectic manifolds is applied to constructing infinite dimensional irreducible unitary representations of the algebra of functions on the compact quantum group $SU_q(2)$. A formulation of the method for the general case $SU_q(n)$ is suggested. (This work is the English version of the article submitted for publication in Algebra Analiz.) 
"Recent progress in the perturbative analysis of hadronic jets, especially in the context of hadron colliders, is discussed. The characteristic feature of this work is the emergence of a level of precision in the study of the strong interactions far beyond that previously possible. Inclusive cross sections for high energy jets at the Tevatron are now perturbatively calculable with a reliability on the order of 10%. At present this theoretical precision is comparable to the quoted experimental errors. Progress has also been made towards understanding both the internal structure of jets and the influence of the details of the jet-defining algorithm. "
"There are strong indications for neutrino masses and mixings in the data on solar neutrinos as well as in the observed deficit of muon neutrinos from the atmosphere. The COBE data and other analysis of the large scale structure in the Universe also seems to require a hot component in the universe's dark matter, which can be interpreted as a massive neutrino with mass in the few eV range. Non-zero neutrino mass is a strong indication of a new local $B-L$ symmetry of electro-weak interactions . In particular, it is noted that the simplest picture based on the left-right symmetric unification with a high scale for the $B-L$ symmetry (as well as the scale of the right-handed gauge boson $W_R$) as required by the constraints of grandunification and present LEP data in a minimal $SO(10)$ model, can accomodate the solar neutrino data and a weak hot dark matter neutrino but not the atmospheric neutrino puzzle. A model with low scale $W_R$ ( in the TeV range) where the Dirac mass of the neutrino arises at the one loop level can also do the same job. The low $W_R$ picture can be tested in many rare decay experiments. "
"It is well-known that topological sigma-models in 2 dimensions constitute a path-integral approach to the study of holomorphic maps from a Riemann surface S to an almost complex manifold K, the most interesting case being that where K is a Kahler manifold. We show that, in the same way, topological sigma-models in 4 dimensions introduce a path integral approach to the study of triholomorphic maps q:M-->N from a 4dimensional Riemannian manifold M to an almost quaternionic manifold N. The most interesting cases are those where M, N are hyperKahler or quaternionic Kahler. BRST-cohomology translates into intersection theory in the moduli-space of this new class of instantonic maps, named by us hyperinstantons. The definition of triholomorphicity that we propose is expressed by the equation q_*-J_u q_* j_u = 0, u=1,2,3, where {j_u} is an almost quaternionic structure on M and {J_u} is an almost quaternionic structure on N. This is a generalization of the Cauchy-Fueter equations. For M, N hyperKahler, this generalization naturally arises by obtaining the topological sigma-model as a twisted version of the N=2 globally supersymmetric sigma-model. We discuss various examples of hyperinstantons, in particular on the torus and the K3 surface. We also analyse the coupling of the topological sigma-model to topological gravity. The study of "
"We study the level crossing of the fermion system described by the euclidean Dirac Hamiltonian in the valley background. One chiral fermion level is shown to cross twice the zero value in the case of well-separated instanton-anti-instanton background. Below a critical separation, however, level crossings are absent. The phenomenon can be interpreted as the transition to a gauge field configuration of purely perturbative nature, below a critical instanton-anti-instanton separation. In the context of high-energy electroweak interactions, our findings seem to definitely invalidate some optimistic argument concerning the observability of baryon number violation based on the use of the optical theorem in conjunction with the valley fields. "
"We give a general expression for the static potential energy of the gravitational interaction of two massive particles, in terms of an invariant vacuum expectation value of the quantized gravitational field. This formula holds for functional integral formulations of euclidean quantum gravity, regularized to avoid conformal instability. It could be regarded as the analogue of the Wilson loop for gauge theories and allows in principle, through numerical simulations or other approximation techniques, non perturbative evaluations of the potential or of the effective coupling constant. The geometrical meaning of this expression is quite simple, as it represents the ``average proper-time delay'', respect to two neighboring lines, of a very long geodesic with unit timelike tangent vector. "
"We discuss the Chooz experiment, a long baseline search for neutrino vacuum oscillations, which will utilize a large gadolinium-loaded liquid scintillation detector one km from a large nuclear power station in France. The 300-meter (water equivalent) underground site of the detector reduces cosmic ray muons, the main source of background in this type of experiment, by a factor of 300, thereby allowing clean detection of antineutrinos from the reactor. The experimental goal is to probe \Delta m^2 values down to 1E-3 eV^2 for large values of sin^2 2\theta and mixing angles to 0.08 for favorable regions of \Delta m^2. A subsequent experiment which will have a 13 km baseline at the former IMB site in Ohio and which can reach \Delta m^2 = 8E-5 eV^2 is also briefly described. "
"If black hole formation and evaporation can be described by an $S$ matrix, information would be expected to come out in black hole radiation. An estimate shows that it may come out initially so slowly, or else be so spread out, that it would never show up in an analysis perturbative in $M_{Planck}/M$, or in 1/N for two-dimensional dilatonic black holes with a large number $N$ of minimally coupled scalar fields. "
"Pair production of Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in a magnetic field can be described by a euclidean instanton. It is shown that the instanton amplitude contains an explicit factor of $e^{A/4}$, where $A$ is the area of the event horizon. This is consistent with the hypothesis that $e^{A/4}$ measures the number of black hole states. "
We present an algebraic U(7) model for baryons which encompasses both single-particle and collective forms of quark dynamics. The mass operator by construction preserves the permutation symmetry between identical quarks. The underlying geometric structure of baryons is discussed in terms of a rigid rotating and vibrating oblate top shape. The model is applied to the mass spectrum of nonstrange baryons. 
"'t~Hooft's abelian projection of $SU(N)$ gauge theory yields $N$ mutually constrained, compact abelian fields which are permutationally equivalent. We formulate the notion of ``species permutation'' symmetry of the $N$ abelian projection fields and discuss its consequences for cross-species correlators. We show that at large $N$ cross-species interactions are ${1\over N}$ suppressed relative to same-species interactions. Numerical simulations at $N=3$ support our symmetry arguments and reveal the existence of inter-species interactions of size ${\cal O\/}\bigl({1\over N-1}\bigr)$ as analytically predicted. "
"I show that the classical Toda models built on superalgebras, and obtained from a reduction with respect to an $Sl(2)$ algebra, are ""linearly supersymmetrizable"" (by adding spin 1/2 fields) if and only if the $Sl(2)$ is the bosonic part of an $OSp(1|2)$ algebra. In that case, the model is equivalent to the one constructed from a reduction with respect to the $OSp(1|2)$ algebra, up to spin 1/2 fields. The corresponding $W$ algebras are related through a factorization of spin 1/2 fields (bosons and fermions). I illustrate this factorization on an example: the superconformal algebra built on $Sl(n+1|2)$. "
"We present results for two different kinds of high order connections between neurons acting as corrections to the Hopfield model. Equilibrium properties are analyzed using the replica mean-field theory and compared with numerical simulations. An optimal learning algorithm for fourth order connections is given that improves the storage capacity without increasing the weight of the higher order term. While the behavior of one of the models qualitatively resembles the original Hopfield one, the other presents a new and very rich behavior: depending on the strength of the fourth order connections and the temperature, the system presents two distinct retrieval regions separated by a gap, as well as several phase transitions. Also, the spin glass states seems to disappear above a certain value of the load parameter $\alpha$, $\alpha_g$. "
"We study the mass-charge relation for the semiclassical extremal black hole of the $S$-wave sector Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to $N$ conformal scalars. The classical ratio $M/{|Q|}=1$ is shown to be modified to $M/{|Q|} \simeq 1-k/6$ for small $ k \equiv N\hbar/(12\pi Q^{2})$. Furthermore, numerical study for $k<2$ shows that $M/|Q|$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $k$. We speculate on the consequence of such a modification in the 4-dimensional context. "
The purpose of this note is to show how the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem for fractional divisors leads to a quick new proof of Bogomolov's instability theorem for rank two vector bundles on an algebraic surface. 
"We solve explicitly a closed, linear loop equation for the SU(2) Wilson loop average on a two-dimensional plane and generalize the solution to the case of the SU(N) Wilson loop average with an arbitrary closed contour. Furthermore, the flat space solution is generalized to any two-dimensional manifold for the SU(2) Wilson loop average and to any two-dimensional manifold of genus 0 for the SU(N) Wilson loop average. "
"Thermo Field Dynamics for inhomogeneous systems is generalized to quantum fields with a continuous single-particle mass spectrum. The modification of the hamiltonian in states with a local thermal Bogoliubov symmetry is used to calculate thermal conductivity and diffusion coefficient of pions interacting with hot, compressed nuclear matter. "
"We study the response of the interacting electron gas in one dimension on the local external potential. In the low frequency limit the power-law singularities are essentially modifyed by backscattering effects which, in the case of zero forward scattering, result in the universal critical exponent depending only on the Luttinger-liquid interactions. The results obtained may be used to describe singular responses of the 1D boson chains. "
No change at all but this time is possible to typset it!. 
"We propose a mechanism by which the neutrino emission from a supernova-type explosion can be converted into a gamma-ray burst of total energy $\sim 10^{50}$ ergs. This occurs naturally if the explosion is situated inside a ball of trapped neutrinos, which in turn may lie at a galactic core. There are possible unique signatures of this scenario. "
"We discuss how the full dynamics of top condensation models can modify the relations between the physical top mass, the amount of custodial $SU(2)$ violation and the weak gauge boson masses. It is emphasized that it is possible to get phenomenologically acceptable relations between $\Delta\rho$, $m_t$ and $M_W$ and that in addition the scale of new physics can be chosen to be ${\cal O}(TeV)$ such that a fine--tuning problem is avoided. "
"The conductance of a weakly interacting electron gas in the presense of a single scatterer is found at arbitrary strength of the scattering potential. At weak interaction, a simple renormalization group approach can be used instead of the standard bosonization procedure. Our technique allows to take into account the {\em backscattering\/} of electrons that leads to a non-Luttinger-liquid behavior of the low-temperature conductance. In the presence of magnetic field, the backscattering may give rise to a peak in differential conductance at bias equal to the Zeeman energy. "
"We study two dimensional dilaton gravity and supergravity following hamiltonian methods. Firstly, we consider the structure of constraints of 2D dilaton gravity and then the 2D dilaton supergravity is obtained taking the squere root of the bosonic constraints. We integrate exactly the equations of motion in both cases and we show that the solutions of the equation of motion of 2D dilaton supergravity differs from the solutions of 2D dilaton gravity only by boundary conditions on the fermionic variables, i.e. the black holes of 2D dilaton supergravity theory are exactly the same black holes of 2D bosonic dilaton gravity modulo supersymmetry transformations. This result is the bidimensional analogue of the no-hair theorem for supergravity. "
"We show how a spontaneously broken gauge theory of fermions endowed with a composite scalar multiplet becomes naturally anomaly-free, and yet describes the correct couplings of the pion to two gauge fields and to leptons: the first coupling is the same as computed from the chiral anomaly, and the second identical with that obtained from the `Partially Conserved Axial Current' hypothesis. For the sake of simplicity, we only study here the abelian case. "
"A new parameterisation of the solutions of Toda field theory is introduced. In this parameterisation, the solutions of the field equations are real, well-defined functions on space-time, which is taken to be two-dimensional Minkowski space or a cylinder. The global structure of the covariant phase space of Toda theory is examined and it is shown that it is isomorphic to the Hamiltonian phase space. The Poisson brackets of Toda theory are then calculated. Finally, using the methods developed to study the Toda theory, we extend these results to the non-Abelian Toda field theories. "
"We have found generic Killing spinor identities which bosonic equations of motion have to satisfy in supersymmetric theories if the solutions admit Killing spinors. Those identities constrain possible quantum corrections to bosonic solutions with unbroken supersymmetries. As an application we show that purely electric static extreme dilaton black holes may acquire specific quantum corrections, but the purely magnetic ones cannot. "
"This review concentrates almost entirely on globular star clusters. It emphasises the increasing realisation that few of the traditional problems of star cluster astronomy can be studied in isolation: the influence of the Galaxy affects dynamical evolution deep in the core, and the spectrum of stellar masses; in turn the evolution of the core determines the highest stellar densities, and the rate of encounters. In this way external tidal effects indirectly influence the formation and evolution of blue stragglers, binary pulsars, X-ray sources, etc. More controversially, the stellar density appears to influence the relative distribution of normal stars. In the opposite sense, the evolution of individual stars governs much of the early dynamics of a globular cluster, and the existence of large numbers of primordial binary stars has changed important details of our picture of the dynamical evolution. New computational tools which will become available in the next few years will help dynamical theorists to address these questions. "
Vortical flows in shallow water interact with long surface waves by virtue of the nonlinear terms of the fluid equations. Analytical formulae are derived that quantify the spontaneous generation of such waves by unsteady vorticity as well as the scattering of surface waves by vorticity. In a first Born approximation the radiated surface elevation is linearly related to the Fourier transform of the vorticity. The ``dislocated'' wavefronts that are analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm effect are obtained as a special case. 
"The general solutions for the factorization equations of the reflection matrices $K^{\pm}(\theta)$ for the eight vertex and six vertex models (XYZ, XXZ and XXX chains) are found. The associated integrable magnetic Hamiltonians are explicitly derived, finding families dependig on several continuous as well as discrete parameters. "
"A gas of electrons confined to a plane is examined in both the relativistic and nonrelativistic case. Using a (0+1)-dimensional effective theory, a remarkably simple method is proposed to calculate the spin density induced by an uniform magnetic background field. The physical properties of possible fluxon excitations are determined. It is found that while in the relativistic case they can be considered as half-fermions (semions) in that they carry half a fermion charge and half the spin of a fermion, in the nonrelativistic case they should be thought of as fermions, having the charge and spin of a fermion. "
"When the new data on polarised lepton nucleon scattering are compared at the same value of $Q^2$ and with a common set of assumptions, a consistent picture of the spin content of the nucleon begins to emerge. Higher order effects in $0(\alpha_s)$, higher twist effects, modern data on unpolarised structure functions and an updated value for F/D are all important in analysing the data. The detailed x dependences of the polarisation asymmetry in the valence quark region are shown to confirm 20 year old predictions of the quark model and I argue that these are an important ingredient in decoding the nucleon spin puzzle. "
"We report results of an investigation of relativistic causality constraints on the measurability of nonlocal variables. We show that measurability of certain nondegenerate variables with entangled eigenstates contradicts the principle of causality, but that there are other, certainly nonlocal, variables which can be measured without breaking causality. We show that any causal measurement of nonlocal variables must erase certain local information. For example, for a system of two spin-1/2 particles, even if we take the weakest possible definition of verification measurement, verification of an entangled state must erase all local information. "
"The general SUSY soft breaking terms for a large class of phenomenologically relevant string scenarios (symmetric orbifolds) are given. They show a certain lack of universality, but not dangerous for flavor changing neutral currents. To get more quantitative results a specific SUSY breaking mechanism has to be considered, namely gaugino condensation in the hidden sector. Then, it turns out that squark and slepton masses tend to be much larger than scalar masses ($m_{\phi} > 10 M_a$), which probably is a quite general fact. Experimental bounds and the requirement of a successful electroweak breaking without fine tuning impose further restrictions on the soft breaking terms. As a consequence the gluino and chargino masses should be quite close to their present experimental limits, whereas squark and slepton masses should be much higher (> 1 TeV). "
"The recent measurements of lepton nucleon scattering with polarised neutron and deuteron targets are analysed together with the previous polarised proton data in a mutually consistent way. The detailed $x$-dependence of the polarisation asymmetry in the valence region is shown to be in agreement with historical predictions based on quark models. The Bjorken sum rule is shown to be confirmed at the $1\sigma$ level and estimates of the spin content of the nucleon $\Delta q$ are extracted. While the average value of $\Delta q$ from the three experiments comes out to be $0.41\pm0.05$ (to be compared with the naive quark model theoretical expectation of 0.58) this experimental average value is more than one standard deviation from the value obtained from any individual experiment.This inconsistency can be overcome by allowing arbitrary higher twist contributions but the resulting precision is poor, $\Delta q = 0.38\pm 0.48$. "
"In recent work on Einstein gravity in four dimensions using the Ashtekar variables, non-local loop variables have played an important role in attempts to formulate a quantum theory. The introduction of such variables is guided by gauge invariance, and here an infinite set of loop variables is introduced for the Hamiltonian form of the Einstein-Maxwell theory. The loops that enter the description naturally are the (source free) electric field lines. These variables are invariant under spatial diffeomorphisms and they also form a closed Poisson algebra. As such they may be useful for quantization attempts and for studying classical solutions. "
"Direct and resolved photon interactions are shown to be intimately related through the factorization mechanism. It is argued that in theoretically consistent analysis of jet production in $\gamma$p and ep collisions the LO resolved $\gamma$ contribution must be considered together with the NLO direct $\gamma$ component. Recent data from HERA therefore do not provide a direct evidence for the former component, but should rather be interpreted as a manifestation of the $O(\alpha\alpha_s^2)$ term in $\gamma$p and, via the Weizs\""acker-Williams approximation, in ep interactions. "
Consequences of relativistic causality for measurements of nonlocal characteristics of composite quantum systems are investigated. It is proved that verification measurements of entangled states necessarily erase local information. A complete analysis of measurability of nondegenerate spin operators of a system of two spin-1/2 particles is presented. It is shown that measurability of certain projection operators which play an important role in axiomatic quantum theory contradicts the causality principle. 
"Let $\Theta$ be a symmetric theta divisor on an indecomposable principally polarized complex abelian variety $X$. The linear system $|2\Theta |$ defines a morphism $K:X\ra |2\Theta |^*$, whose image is the Kummer variety $K(X)$ of $X$. When $(X,\theta)$ is the Jacobian of an algebraic curve, there are infinitely many trisecants lines to $K(X)$. Welters has conjectured that the existence of one trisecant line to the Kummer variety should characterize Jacobians. The purpose of this article is to show the following weak version of Welters conjecture: $X$ is a Jacobian if and only if there exist points $a,b,c$ of $X$ such that (i) the subgroup of $X$ generated by $a-b$ and $b-c$ is dense in $X$, (ii) the points $K(a)$, $K(b)$ and $K(c)$ are distinct and collinear. This improves on previous results obtained by the author (Trisecant Lines And Jacobians, J. Alg. Geom. 1 (1992), 5--14). Various degenerate cases of the conjecture are also considered. "
"In a class of supersymmetric left-right models (SUSYLR) of weak interactions where R-parity is automatically conserved, we show that spontaneous breakdown of parity CANNOT occur without spontaneous breakdown of R-parity. This intriguing result connects two physically different scales in supersymmetric models. "
"We prove that the error term $\La(R)$ in the Weyl asymptotic formula $$\#\{ E_n\le R^2\}={\Vol M\over 4\pi} R^2+\La(R),$$ for the Laplace operator on a surface of revolution $M$ satisfying a twist hypothesis, has the form $\La(R) =R^{1/2}F(R)$ where $F(R)$ is an almost periodic function of the Besicovitch class $B^2$, and the Fourier series of $F(R)$ in $B^2$ is $\sum_\g A(\g)\cos(|\g|R-\phi)$ where the sum goes over all closed geodesics on $M$, and $A(\g)$ is computed through simple geometric characteristics of $\g$. We extend this result to surfaces of revolution, which violate the twist hypothesis and satisfy a more general Diophantine hypothesis. In this case we prove that $\La(R)=R^{2/3}\Phi(R)+R^{1/2}F(R)$, where $\Phi(R)$ is a finite sum of periodic functions and $F(R)$ is an almost periodic function of the Besicovitch class $B^2$. The Fourier series of $\Phi(R)$ and $F(R)$ are computed. "
It is shown that a Coulomb potential using a running coupling slightly modified from the perturbative form can produce an interquark potential that appears nearly linear over a large distance range. Recent high-statistics SU(2) lattice gauge theory data fit well to this potential without the need for a linear string-tension term. This calls into question the accuracy of string tension measurements which are based on the assumption of a constant coefficient for the Coulomb term. It also opens up the possibility of obtaining an effectively confining potential from gluon exchange alone. 
"In the first quantised description of strings, we integrate over target space co-ordinates $X^\mu$ and world sheet metrics $g_{\alpha\beta}$. Such path integrals give scattering amplitudes between the `in' and `out' vacuua for a time-dependent target space geometry. For a complete description of `particle creation' and the corresponding backreaction, we need instead the causal amplitudes obtained from an `initial value formulation'. We argue, using the analogy of a scalar particle in curved space, that in the first quantised path integral one should integrate over $X^\mu$ and world sheet {\it zweibiens}. This extended formalism can be made to yield causal amplitudes; it also naturally allows incorporation of density matrices in a covariant manner. (This paper is an expanded version of hep-th 9301044) "
"Highly dynamic magnetospheric perturbations in neutron star environments can naturally account for the features observed in Gamma-ray Burst spectra. The source distribution, however, appears to be extragalactic. Although noncatastrophic isotropic emission mechanisms may be ruled out on energetic and timing arguments, MHD processes can produce strongly anisotropic gamma-rays with an observable flux out to distances of around 1-2 Gpc. Here we show that sheared Alfven waves propagating along open magnetospheric field lines at the poles of magnetized neutron stars transfer their energy dissipationally to the current sustaining the field misalignment and thereby focus their power into a spatial region around 1000 times smaller than that of the crustal disturbance. This produces a strong (observable) flux enhancement along certain directions. We apply this model to a source population of ``turned-off'' pulsars that have nonetheless retained their strong magnetic fields and have achieved alignment at a period of greater than 5 seconds. "
The momentum-dependence of the $\rho^0$-$\omega$ mixing contribution to charge-symmetry breaking (CSB) in the nucleon-nucleon interaction is compared in a variety of models. We focus in particular on the role that the structure of the quark propagator plays in the predicted behaviour of the $\rho^0$-$\omega$ mixing amplitude. We present new results for a confining (entire) quark propagator and for typical propagators arising from explicit numerical solutions of quark Dyson-Schwinger equations. We compare these to hadronic and free quark calculations. The implications for our current understanding of CSB experiments is discussed. 
We rewrite the action for $QCD_2$ in the light cone gauge only in terms of a bilocal mesonic field. In this formalism the $1/N$ expansion can be done in a straightforward way by a saddle point technique that determines the master field to be identified with the vacuum expectation value of the bilocal field. Finally we show that the equation of motion for the fluctuations around the master field is identical with the 't Hooft meson equation. 
"The long-term transitions of the black hole candidate Cygnus X-1 (between the states gamma_1, gamma_2, and gamma_3) include the occasional appearance of a strong ~ MeV bump (gamma_1), whose strength appears to be anti-correlated with the continuum flux (~ 400 keV) due to the Compton upscattering of cold disk photons by the inner, hot corona. We develop a self-consistent disk picture that accounts naturally for these transitions and their corresponding spectral variations. We argue that the bump is due to the self-Comptonization of bremsstrahlung photons emitted predominantly near the plane of the corona itself. Our results suggest that a decrease by a factor of approx 2 in the viscosity parameter alpha is responsible for quenching this bump and driving the system to the gamma_2 state, whereas a transition from gamma_2 to gamma_3 appears to be induced by an increase of about 25 % in the accretion rate Mdot. In view of the fact that most of the transitions observed in this source seem to be of the gamma_2 to gamma_3 variety, we conclude that much of the long term gamma-ray spectral variability in Cygnus X-1 is due to these small fluctuations in Mdot. The unusual appearance of the gamma_1 state apparently reflects a change in the dissipative processes within the disk. "
Exponential solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation give rise to generalized Schubert polynomials and corresponding symmetric functions. We provide several descriptions of the local stationary algebra defined by this equation. This allows to construct various exponential solutions of the YBE. The $B_n$ and $G_2$ cases are also treated. 
"The field mixing that manifests broken particle-hole symmetry is studied for a 2-D asymmetric lattice gas model having tunable field mixing properties. Monte Carlo simulations within the grand canonical ensemble are used to obtain the critical density distribution for different degrees of particle-hole asymmetry. Except in the special case when this asymmetry vanishes, the density distributions exhibit an antisymmetric correction to the limiting scale-invariant form. The presence of this correction reflects the mixing of the critical energy density into the ordering operator. Its functional form is found to be in excellent agreement with that predicted by the mixed-field finite-size-scaling theory of Bruce and Wilding. A computational procedure for measuring the significant field mixing parameter is also described, and its accuracy gauged by comparing the results with exact values obtained analytically. "
"We propose a model of directed lines where the average direction has the nature of a cholesteric liquid crystal. This model, for instance, would describe the liquid of screw dislocations in the twist-grain-boundary (TGB) phase of liquid crystals. We show that the presence of lines does not alter the long wavelength elasticity of a cholesteric and, therefore, does not stabilize Landau-Peierls instability of the cholesteric phase. We discuss other possible mechanisms for stabilizing the twist-grain-boundary phase. "
A new approach of implementing initial and boundary conditions for the lattice Boltzmann method is presented. The new approach is based on an extended collision operator that uses the gradients of the fluid velocity. The numerical performance of the lattice Boltzmann method is tested on several problems with exact solutions and is also compared to an explicit finite difference projection method. The discretization error of the lattice Boltzmann method decreases quadratically with finer resolution both in space and in time. The roundoff error of the lattice Boltzmann method creates problems unless double precision arithmetic is used. 
The interaction of the spinor field with the Weinberg's $2(2S+1)$- component massless field is considered. New interpretation of the Weinberg's spinor is proposed. The equation analogous to the Dirac oscillator is obtained. 
"We analyze the consequences of models of structure formation for higher-order ($n$-point) galaxy correlation functions in the mildly non-linear regime. Several variations of the standard $\Omega=1$ cold dark matter model with scale-invariant primordial perturbations have recently been introduced to obtain more power on large scales, 20 h$^{-1}$ Mpc, e.g., low-matter-density (non-zero cosmological constant) models, `tilted' primordial spectra, and scenarios with a mixture of cold and hot dark matter. They also include models with an effective scale-dependent bias, such as the cooperative galaxy formation scenario of Bower, etal. (1993). We show that higher-order galaxy correlation functions can provide a useful test of such models and can discriminate between models with true large-scale power in the density field and those where the galaxy power arises from scale-dependent bias: a bias with rapid scale-dependence leads to a dramatic decrease of the hierarchical amplitudes at large scales. Current observational constraints on the three-point amplitudes $Q_3$ and $S_3$ can place limits on the bias parameter(s) and appear to disfavor, but not yet rule out, the hypothesis that scale-dependent bias is responsible for the extra power observed on large scales. "
"We consider static black holes, which are bosonic solutions of supersymmetric theories. We will show that supersymmetry provides a natural framework for a discussion of various properties of such static black holes. The most fundamental property of simple global supersymmetry, non-negativeness of the energy, is generalized in the black hole theory to cosmic censorship. The SUSY classification of static black holes will be presented in terms of central charges of supersymmetry algebra. The mass, the temperature and the entropy of these black holes are simple functions of supersymmetry charges. The extreme black holes have zero temperature and some unbroken supersymmetries. "
"We present complete one-loop radiative corrections to the decay rate of a top quark into a charged Higgs boson and a bottom quark, and for the decay of a charged Higgs boson into leptons. The results are discussed in the framework of the two Higgs boson extension of the Standard Model suggested by supersymmetry. The effect of electroweak corrections after exclusion of universal corrections $\Delta r$ is found to decrease the partial width of the top quark typically by 5%. "
"Using the symmetry properties of the three-anyon spectrum, we obtain exactly the multiplicities of states with given energy and angular momentum. The results are shown to be in agreement with the proper quantum mechanical and semiclassical considerations, and the unexplained points are indicated. "
"In models of three or more scalar doublets, new CP violating phases appear in charged scalar exchange. These phases affect CP asymmetries in neutral $B$ decays, even if Natural Flavor Conservation holds. The recent upper bound on the decay $b\rightarrow s\gamma$ constrains the effect to be at most of order a few percent. Modifications of constraints on the CKM parameters open an interesting new region in the $\sin2\alpha-\sin2\beta$ plane even in the absence of new phases. "
"We use the definition of the Calogero-Moser models as Hamiltonian reductions of geodesic motions on a group manifold to construct their $R$-matrices. In the Toda case, the analogous construction yields constant $R$-matrices. By contrast, for Calogero-Moser models they are dynamical objects. "

A simplified proof of a theorem by Joglekar and Lee on the renormalization of local gauge invariant operators in Yang-Mills theory is given. It is based on (i) general properties of the antifield-antibracket formalism; and (ii) well-established results on the cohomology of semi-simple Lie algebras. 
We present a self-consistent ansatz for a new sphaleron in the electroweak standard model. The resulting field equations are solved numerically. This sphaleron sets the height of the energy barrier for the global SU(2) anomaly.

"For a large class of Banach spaces, a general construction of subspaces without local unconditional structure is presented. As an application it is shown that every Banach space of finite cotype contains either $l_2$ or a subspace without unconditional basis, which admits a Schauder basis. Some other interesting applications and corollaries follow. "
"We analyze quantum two dimensional dilaton gravity model, which is described by $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model deformed by $(1,1)$ operator. We show that the curvature singularity does not appear when the central charge $c_{\rm matter}$ of the matter fields is given by $22<c_{\rm matter}<24$. When $22<c_{\rm matter}<24$, the matter shock waves, whose energy momentum tensors are given by $T_{\rm matter} \propto \delta(x^+ - x^+_0)$, create a kind of wormholes, {\it i.e.,} causally disconnected regions. Most of the quantum informations in past null infinity are lost in future null infinity but the lost informations would be carried by the wormholes. We also discuss about the problem of defining the mass of quantum black holes. On the basis of the argument by Regge and Teitelboim, we show that the ADM mass measured by the observer who lives in one of asymptotically flat regions is finite and does not vanish in general. On the other hand, the Bondi mass is ill-defined in this model. Instead of the Bondi mass, we consider the mass measured by observers who live in an asymptotically flat region at first. A class of the observers finds the mass of the black hole created by a shock wave changes as the observers' proper time goes by, i.e. they observe the Hawking radiation. The measured mass vanishes after the infinite proper time and the black hole evaporates completely. Therefore the total Hawking radiation is positive even when $N<24$. "
"When a source of gravity waves is conveniently placed between the Earth and some source of light, preferably a pulsating source, the magnitude of time delays induced by the gravity waves could, in optimal situations, be not too far out of the reach of already existing technology. Besides the odd case of near-to-perfect alignment one might be lucky enough to encounter in the Galaxy, there exists several astronomical sites where good alignment occurs naturally. A good example is when the light source and the gravity-wave source are, respectively, a high-frequency pulsar and a neutron star, locked together in a tight binary. We are lead to believe that neutron-star gravity waves might be directly observable in timing data of systems such as PSR B1913+16. "
"In this paper we study the quantum Clifford-Hopf algebras $\widehat{CH_q(D)}$ for even dimensions $D$ and obtain their intertwiner $R-$matrices, which are elliptic solutions to the Yang- Baxter equation. In the trigonometric limit of these new algebras we find the possibility to connect with extended supersymmetry. We also analyze the corresponding spin chain hamiltonian, which leads to Suzuki's generalized $XY$ model. "
"Saxino decay can generate significant cosmological entropy, and hence dilute theoretical estimates of the present mass density of a given particle species. The dilution factor depends on the saxino and axion masses, and is constrained by the requirement that saxino decay should not affect nucleosynthesis, as well as by the usual requirement that the axion density be less than the critical density. The latter constraint is evaluated carefully, under both the Harari-Sikivie and Davis proposals about the emission spectrum from axionic strings. Uncertainties are carefully evaluated, points of principle are addressed, and with an eye to future numerical simulation the spacing and typical oscillation wavelength of the strings are represented by parameters varying in the range 1 to 3. Within the constraints, the entropy dilution varies from 1 to $10^{-4}$. Only saxinos originating from thermal equilibrium are considered, so that more dilution might arise from non-thermal saxinos. "
"The longitudinal-electric oscillations of the hot gluon system are studied beyond the well known leading order term at high temperature $T$ and small coupling $g$. The coefficient $\eta$ in $\omega^2 = m^2 \, (1+ \eta \, g \wu N \, )$ is calculated, where \hbox{$\omega \equiv \omega (\vc q =0)$} is the long-wavelength limit of the frequency spectrum, $N$ the number of colours and $m^2=g^2 N T^2/9$. In the course of this, for the real part of the gluon self-energy, the Braaten-Pisarski resummation programme is found to work well in all details. The coefficient $\eta$ is explicitly seen to be gauge independent within the class of covariant gauges. Infrared singularities cancel as well as collinear singularities in the two-loop diagrams with both inner momenta hard. However, as it turns out, none of these two-loop contributions reaches the relative order $O(g)$ under study. The minus sign in our numerical result $\; \eta = -.18 \; $ is in accord with the intuitive picture that the studied mode might soften with increasing coupling (lower temperature) until a phase transition is reached at zero-frequency. The minus sign thus exhibits the 'glue' effect for the first time in a dynamical quantity of hot QCD. "
"The Heisenberg model, a quantum mechanical analogue of the Ising model, has a large ground state degeneracy, due to the symmetry generated by the total spin. This symmetry is also responsible for degeneracies in the rest of the spectrum. We discuss the global structure of the spectrum of Heisenberg models with arbitrary couplings, using group theoretical methods. The Hilbert space breaks up in blocks characterized by the quantum numbers of the total spin, $S$ and $M$, and each block is shown to constitute the representation space of an explicitly given irreducible representation of the symmetric group $S_N$, consisting of permutations of the $N$ spins in the system. In the second part of the paper we consider, as a concrete application, the model where each spin is coupled to all the other spins with equal strength. Its partition function is written as a single integral, elucidating its $N$-dependence. This provides a useful framework for studying finite size effects. We give explicit results for the heat capacity, revealing interesting behavior just around the phase transition. "
"We study the ground state properties of the S=$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet (HAF) on the triangular lattice with nearest-neighbour ($J$) and next-nearest neighbour ($\alpha J$) couplings. Classically, this system is known to be ordered in a $120^\circ$ N\'eel type state for values $-\infty<\alpha\le 1/8$ of the ratio $\alpha$ of these couplings and in a collinear state for $1/8<\alpha<1$. The order parameter ${\cal M}$ and the helicity $\chi$ of the $120^\circ$ structure are obtained by numerical diagonalisation of finite periodic systems of up to $N=30$ sites and by applying the spin-wave (SW) approximation to the same finite systems. We find a surprisingly good agreement between the exact and the SW results in the entire region $-\infty<\alpha< 1/8$. It appears that the SW theory is still valid for the simple triangular HAF ($\alpha=0$) although the sublattice magnetisation ${\cal M}$ is substantially reduced from its classical value by quantum fluctuations. Our numerical results for the order parameter ${\cal N}$ of the collinear order support the previous conjecture of a first order transition between the $120^\circ$ and the collinear order at $\alpha \simeq 1/8$. "
"When one uses the Dirac bracket, second class constraints become first class. Hence, they are amenable to the BRST treatment characteristic of ordinary first class constraints. This observation is the starting point of a recent investigation by Batalin and Tyutin, in which all the constraints are put on the same footing. However, because second class constraints identically vanish as operators in the quantum theory, they are quantum-mechanically reducible and require therefore ghosts of ghosts. Otherwise, the BRST cohomology would not yield the correct physical spectrum. We discuss how to incorporate this feature in the formalism and show that it leads to an infinite tower of ghosts of ghosts. An alternative treatment, in which the brackets of the ghosts are modified, is also mentioned. "
"We discuss some outstanding open questions regarding the validity and uniqueness of the standard second order Newton-Einstein classical gravitational theory. On the observational side we discuss the degree to which the realm of validity of Newton's Law of Gravity can actually be extended to distances much larger than the solar system distance scales on which the law was originally established. On the theoretical side we identify some commonly accepted but actually still open to question assumptions which go into the formulating of the standard second order Einstein theory in the first place. In particular, we show that while the familiar second order Poisson gravitational equation (and accordingly its second order covariant Einstein generalization) may be sufficient to yield Newton's Law of Gravity they are not in fact necessary. The standard theory thus still awaits the identification of some principle which would then make it necessary too. We show that current observational information does not exclusively mandate the standard theory, and that the conformal invariant fourth order theory of gravity considered recently by Mannheim and Kazanas is also able to meet the constraints of data, and in fact to do so without the need for any so far unobserved non-luminous or dark matter. "
It is argued that confining effects in 3-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories (high-temperature limit of 4-dimensional ones) imply the existence of the condensates of the gauge and Higgs fields in 3-d vacuum. This non-perturbative effect can decrease the energy of the phase with unbroken symmetry and may result in the creation of a barrier separating the broken and unbroken phases. Thus the high-temperature phase transitions in gauge theories can be stronger first order than is expected from perturbation theory. The applications of these results to electroweak baryogenesis are briefly discussed. 
"The U(N) gauge theory on a D-dimensional lattice is reformulated as a theory of lattice strings (a statistical model of random surfaces). The Boltzmann weights of the surfaces can have both signs and are tuned so that the longitudinal modes of the string are elliminated. The U(\infty) gauge theory is described by noninteracting planar surfaces and the 1/N corrections are produced by surfaces with higher topology as well as by contact interactions due to microscopic tubes, trousers, handles, etc. We pay special attention to the case D=2 where the sum over surfaces can be performed explicitly, and demonstrate that it reproduces the known exact results for the free energy and Wilson loops in the continuum limit. In D=4 dimensions, our lattice string model reproduces the strong coupling phase of the gauge theory. The weak coupling phase is described by a more complicated string whose world surface may have windows. A possible integration measure in the space of continuous surfaces is suggested. "
Chiral defect fermions on the lattice in 4+1 dimensions are analyzed using mean field theory. The fermion propagator has a localized chiral mode in weak coupling but loses it when the coupling in the unphysical fifth direction becomes too large. A layered phase \`a la Fu-Nielsen appears where the theory is vector-like in every layer. 
We solve the conformal bootstrap equations of the four fermi model or $O(N)$ Gross Neveu model to deduce the fermion anomalous dimension of the theory at $O(1/N^3)$ in arbitrary dimensions. 
The production of antiprotons in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus reactions is calculated within the relativistic BUU approach employing proper selfenergies for the baryons and antiprotons and treating the p-bar annihilation nonperturbatively. The differential cross section for the antiprotons is found to be very sensitive to the p-bar selfenergy adopted. A detailed comparison with the available experimental data for p-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus reactions shows that the antiproton feels a moderately attractive mean-field at normal nuclear matter density which is in line with a dispersive potential extracted from the free annihilation cross section. 
We solve the gauged Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model at leading order in the large $N$ expansion by computing the anomalous dimensions of all the fields of the model and other gauge independent critical exponents by examining the scaling behaviour of the Schwinger Dyson equation. We then restrict to the three dimensional model and include a Chern Simons term to discover the $\theta$-dependence of the same exponents where $\theta$ is the Chern Simons coupling. 
"We consider the uncertainty relation between position and momentum of a particle on $ S^1 $ (a circle). Since $ S^1 $ is compact, the uncertainty of position must be bounded. Consideration on the uncertainty of position demands delicate treatment. Recently Ohnuki and Kitakado have formulated quantum mechanics on $ S^D $ (a $D$-dimensional sphere). Armed with their formulation, we examine this subject. We also consider parity and find a phenomenon similar to the spontaneous symmetry breaking. We discuss problems which we encounter when we attempt to formulate quantum mechanics on a general manifold. "
"We use Renormalization Group ideas to study stability of moving fronts in the Ginzburg-Landau equation in one spatial dimension. In particular, we prove stability of the real fronts under complex perturbations. This extends the results of Aronson and Weinberger to situations where the maximum principle is inapplicable and constitutes a step in proving the general marginal stability hypothesis for the Ginzburg-Landau equation. "
"The simple argument given in the previous version ""that almost certainly restricts heavy fermion UPd_2Al_3 to be an odd parity superconductor with a single component order parameter"" is not correct. "
"Recently Witten proposed to consider elliptic genus in $N=2$ superconformal field theory to understand the relation between $N=2$ minimal models and Landau-Ginzburg theories. In this paper we first discuss the basic properties satisfied by elliptic genera in $N=2$ theories. These properties are confirmed by some fundamental class of examples. Then we introduce a generic procedure to compute the elliptic genera of a particular class of orbifold theories, {\it i.e.\/} the ones orbifoldized by $e^{2\pi iJ_0}$ in the Neveu-Schwarz sector. This enables us to calculate the elliptic genera for Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds. When the Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds allow an interpretation as target manifolds with $SU(N)$ holonomy we can compare the expressions with the ones obtained by orbifoldizing tensor products of $N=2$ minimal models. We also give sigma model expressions of the elliptic genera for manifolds of $SU(N)$ holonomy. "
"By replacing two of the bosonic scalar superfields of the N=2 string with fermionic scalar superfields (which shifts $d_{critical}$ from (2,2) to (9,1)), a quadratic action for the ten-dimensional Green-Schwarz superstring is obtained. Using the usual N=2 super-Virasoro ghosts, one can construct a BRST operator, picture-changing operators, and covariant vertex operators for the Green-Schwarz superstring. Superstring scattering amplitudes with an arbitrary number of loops and external massless states are then calculated by evaluating correlation functions of these vertex operators on N=2 super-Riemann surfaces, and integrating over the N=2 super-moduli. These multiloop superstring amplitudes have been proven to be SO(9,1) super-Poincar\'e invariant (by constructing the super-Poincar\'e generators and writing the amplitudes in manifest SO(9,1) notation), unitary (by showing agreement with amplitudes obtained using the light-cone gauge Green-Schwarz formalism), and finite (by explicitly checking for divergences in the amplitudes when the Riemann surface degenerates). There is no multiloop ambiguity in these Green-Schwarz scattering amplitudes since spacetime-supersymmetry is manifest (there is no sum over spin structures), and therefore the moduli space can be compactified. "
In this note we show that every Banach space $X$ not containing $\ell_1^n$ uniformly and with unconditional basis contains an arbitrarily distortable subspace. 
"Simple mean field methods can be used to describe transitions between different space-time models in string theory. These include transitions between different Calabi-Yau manifolds, and more exotic things such as the Calabi-Yau/Landau-Ginzberg correspondence. "
"We consider the classical problem of the blowing-up of solutions of the nonlinear heat equation. We show that there exist infinitely many profiles around the blow-up point, and for each integer $k$, we construct a set of codimension $2k$ in the space of initial data giving rise to solutions that blow-up according to the given profile. "
"We present a general method for studying long time asymptotics of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations. The method does not rely on a priori estimates such as the maximum principle. It applies to systems of coupled equations, to boundary conditions at infinity creating a front, and to higher (possibly fractional) differential linear terms. We present in detail the analysis for nonlinear diffusion-type equations with initial data falling off at infinity and also for data interpolating between two different stationary solutions at infinity. "
"By using the corrections to the asymptotic scaling forms of the fields of the $O(N)$ Gross Neveu model to solve the dressed skeleton Schwinger Dyson equations, we deduce the critical exponent corresponding to the $\beta$-function of the model at $O(1/N^2)$. "
"Using the Euclidean path-integral formulation for the hadronic tensor, we show that the violation of the Gottfried sum rule does not come from the disconnected quark-loop insertion. Rather, it comes from the connected (quark line) insertion involving quarks propagating in the backward time direction. We demonstrate this by studying sum rules in terms of the scalar and axial- vector matrix elements in lattice gauge calculations. The effects of eliminating backward time propagation are presented. "
"The $S$-matrix of the Ising Model can be obtained as particular limit of the roaming trajectories associated to of the $S$-matrix of the Sinh-Gordon model. Using the form factors of the Sinh-Gordon, we analyse the correspondence between the operators of the two theories. "
"A Banach space is $c_0$-saturated if all of its closed infinite dimensional subspaces contain an isomorph of $c_0$. In this article, we study the stability of this property under the formation of direct sums and tensor products. Some of the results are: (1) a slightly more general version of the fact that $c_0$-sums of $c_0$-saturated spaces are $c_0$-saturated; (2) $C(K,E)$ is $c_0$-saturated if both $C(K)$ and $E$ are; (3) the tensor product $JH\tilde{\otimes}_\epsilon JH$ is $c_0$-saturated, where $JH$ is the James Hagler space. "
"A number of recent experiments have showed that surfactants can modify the growth mode of an epitaxial film, suppressing islanding and promoting layer-by-layer growth. Here I introduce a set of coupled equations to describe the nonequilibrium roughening of an interface covered with a thin surfactant layer. The surfactant may drive the system into a novel phase, in which the surface roughness is negative, corresponding to a flat surface. "
It is argued that the noncommutative geometry construction of the standard model predicts a nonlinear symmetry breaking mechanism rather than the orthodox Higgs mechanism. Such models have experimentally verifiable consequences. 
"It is shown that the St\""uckelberg formalism can be regarded as a field-enlarging transformation that introduces an additional gauge symmetry to the considered model. The appropriate BRST charge can be defined. The physical state condition, demanding that that a physical state is to be anihilated by the BRST charge, is shown to be equivalent to the St\""uckelberg condition. Several applications of the new approach to the formalism are presented. The comparison with the BFV procedure is given. (The author field has been corrected.) "
"In high energy heavy ion collisions the pion multiplicity is large, and one might expect that pions are radiated semi-classically. The axial symmetry of the collision and approximately zero isotopic spin of the colliding nuclei result then in peculiar isotopic spin -- azimuth correlations of the produced pions. These correlations are easy to test -- and should be tested. "
"We describe the $R$-matrix structure associated with integrable extensions, containing both one-body and two-body potentials, of the $A_N$ Calogero-Moser $N$-body systems. We construct non-linear, finite dimensional Poisson algebras of observables. Their $N \rightarrow \infty$ limit realize the infinite Lie algebras Sdiff$({\Bbb R} \times S_1 )$ in the trigonometric case and Sdiff$({\Bbb R }^2)$ in the rational case. It is then isomorphic to the algebra of observables constructed in the two-dimensional collective string field theory. "
"We show that the master equation governing the dynamics of simple diffusion and certain chemical reaction processes in one dimension give time evolution operators (Hamiltonians) which are realizations of Hecke algebras. In the case of simple diffusion one obtains, after similarity transformations, reducible hermitian representations while in the other cases they are non-hermitian and correspond to supersymmetric quotients of Hecke algebras. "
"By studying the geometric properties of correlation functions on the theory space, we are naturally led to a connection for the infinite dimensional vector bundle of composite fields over the theory space. We show how the short distance singularities of the theory are determined by the geometry of the theory space, i.e., the connection, beta functions, and anomalous dimensions. (This is a summary of the talk given at Strings '93 in Berkeley. The unnecessary blank lines in the original version have been removed in this revised version.) "
"Using odd symplectic structure constructed over tangent bundle of the symplectic manifold, we construct the simple supergeneralization of an arbitrary Hamiltonian mechanics on it. In the case, if the initial mechanics defines Killing vector of some Riemannian metric, corresponding supersymmetric mechanics can be reformulated in the terms of even symplectic structure on the supermanifold. "
"In the present paper we discuss stability of the tanget bundle of a Fano n-fold of index >= n-2 and b_2=1. For example, we prove that all Fano 4-folds with b_2=1 have stable tangent bundle. For this purpose we prove some vanishing theorems for sheaves of twisted holomorphic forms on ample divisors and cyclic coverings of manifolds having ""special cohomology"". "
"A model is presented in which supernova-driven winds from early galaxies reionize the intergalactic medium by z=5. This scenario can explain the observed absence of a Gunn-Peterson trough in the spectra of high-redshift quasars providing that the bulk of these early galaxies are quite small, no more massive than about 10^8 solar masses. It also predicts that most of the IGM was enriched to at least 10% of current metal content by z=5 and perhaps as early as z=15. The existence of such early mini-galaxies violates no spectral constraints and is consistent with a pure CDM model with b<2. Since the final radius of a typical ionized bubble is only around 100 kpc, the induced modification of the galaxy autocorrelation function is negligible, as is the induced angular smoothing of the CMBR. Some of the gas swept up by shells may be observable as pressure-supported Lyman-alpha forest clouds. "
"The connection between the scales of $ {\rm SU} (2)\times {\rm U} (1) $ gauge symmetry breaking and supersymmetry breaking is didactically displayed in the framework of a T.O.Y. (Theory Overestimating Yukawas) model, a version of the $ (M+1)SSM $ (supersymmetric extension of the standard model with a gauge singlet) in which the relevant parameters are determined in the fixed point regime. Some conspicuous features of supersymmetric particle physics are reviewed in the light of this simplified model. An alternative theory corresponding to lim $ (M+1)SSM \longrightarrow MSSM, $ leads to interesting inequalities among the supersymmetric breaking parameters of the $ MSSM. $ "
"The difference in production rate between $W^+$ and $W^-$ at hadron colliders is very sensitive to the the difference between up- and down-quark distributions in the proton. This sensitivity allows for a variety of useful measurements. We consider the difference $d_s(x,Q^2) - u_s(x,Q^2)$ in the sea distributions and the difference $\Delta u(x,Q^2) - \Delta d(x,Q^2)$ in the polarized parton distribution functions. In both cases we construct an asymmetry to reduce systematic uncertainties. Although we discuss measurements at the Tevatron and future hadron colliders, we find that the Brookhaven Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is the most appropriate hadron collider for these measurements. "
We consider the valley--method computation of the inclusive cross section of baryon number violating processes in the Standard Model. We show that any physically correct model of the valley action should present a singularity in the saddle point valley parameters as functions of the energy of the process. This singularity prevents the saddle point configuration from collapsing into the perturbative vacuum. 
"Gauge fixing is a frequent task encountered in practical lattice gauge theory calculations. We review the performance characteristics of some standard gauging procedures for non-abelian gauge theories, implemented on the parallel machines CM2 and CM5. "
"Differential regularization is applied to a field theory of a non-relativistic charged boson field $\phi$ with $\lambda (\phi {}^{*} \phi)^2$ self-interaction and coupling to a statistics-changing $U(1)$ Chern-Simons gauge field. Renormalized configuration-space amplitudes for all diagrams contributing to the $\phi {}^{*} \phi {}^{*} \phi \phi$ 4-point function, which is the only primitively divergent Green's function, are obtained up to 3-loop order. The renormalization group equations are explicitly checked, and the scheme dependence of the $\beta$-function is investigated. If the renormalization scheme is fixed to agree with a previous 1-loop calculation, the 2- and 3-loop contributions to $\beta(\lambda,e)$ vanish, and $\beta(\lambda,e)$ itself vanishes when the ``self-dual'' condition relating $\lambda$ to the gauge coupling $e$ is imposed. "
"Changes: figures added in postscript form, Eq. (7) and various typos corrected. We examine the effect of an impurity on the nearby tunneling conductance in an anisotropically-gapped superconductor. The variation of the conductance has pronounced spatial dependence which depends strongly on the Fermi surface location of gap extrema. In particular, different gap symmetries produce profoundly different spatial features in the conductance. These effects may be detectable with an STM measurement on the surface of a high-temperature superconductor. "
"We give a prescription for embedding classical solutions and, in particular, topological defects in field theories which are invariant under symmetry groups that are not necessarily simple. After providing examples of embedded defects in field theories based on simple groups, we consider the electroweak model and show that it contains the $Z$ string and a one parameter family of strings called the $W(\alpha )$ string. It is argued that, although the members of this family are gauge equivalent when considered in isolation, each member should be considered distinct when multi-string solutions are considered. We then turn to the issue of stability of embedded defects and demonstrate the instability of a large class of such solutions in the absence of bound states or condensates. The $Z$ string is shown to be unstable when the Weinberg angle ($\theta_w$) is $\pi /4$ for all values of the Higgs mass. The $W$ strings are also shown to be unstable for a large range of parameters. Embedded monopoles suffer from the Brandt-Neri-Coleman instability. A simple physical understanding of this instability is provided in terms of the phenomenon of W-condensation. Finally, we connect the electroweak string solutions to the sphaleron: ``twisted'' loops of W string and finite segments of W and Z strings collapse into the sphaleron configuration, at least, for small values of $\theta_w$. "
"A perturber may excite a coherent mode in a star cluster or galaxy. If the stellar system is stable, it is commonly assumed that such a mode will be strongly damped and therefore of little practical consequence other than redistributing momentum and energy deposited by the perturber. This paper demonstrates that this assumption is false; weakly damped modes exist and may persist long enough to have observable consequences. To do this, a method for investigating the dispersion relation for spherical stellar systems and for locating weakly damped modes in particular is developed and applied to King models of varying concentration. This leads to the following remarkable result: King models exhibit {\it very} weakly damped $m=1$ modes over a wide range of concentration ($0.67\le c\le1.5$ have been examined). The predicted damping time is tens to hundreds of crossing times. This mode causes the peak density to shift from and slowly revolve about the initial center. The existence of the mode is supported by n-body simulation. Higher order modes and possible astronomical consequences are discussed. Weakly damped modes, for example, may provide a natural explanation for observed discrepancies between density and kinematic centers in galaxies, the location of velocity cusps due to massive black holes, and $m=1$ disturbances of disks embedded in massive halos. Gravitational shocking may excite the $m=1$ mode in globular clusters, which could modify their subsequent evolution and displace the positions of exotic remnants. "
"We introduce the notion of rational Hopf algebras that we think are able to describe the superselection symmetries of two dimensional rational quantum field theories. As an example we show that a six dimensional rational Hopf algebra $H$ can reproduce the fusion rules, the conformal weights, the quantum dimensions and the representation of the modular group of the chiral Ising model. $H$ plays the role of the global symmetry algebra of the chiral Ising model in the following sense: 1) a simple field algebra $\FA$ and a representation $\pi$ on $\HS_\pi$ of it is given, which contains the $c=1/2$ unitary representations of the Virasoro algebra as subrepresentations; 2) the embedding $U\colon H\to\BOH$ is such that the observable algebra $\pi(\OA)^-$ is the invariant subalgebra of $\BOH$ with respect to the left adjoint action of $H$ and $U(H)$ is the commutant of $\pi(\OA)$; 3) there exist $H$-covariant primary fields in $\BOH$, which obey generalized Cuntz algebra properties and intertwine between the inequivalent sectors of the observables. "
"The supersymmetric standard model with supergravity-inspired soft breaking terms predicts a rich pectrum of sparticles to be discovered at the SSC, LHC and NLC. Because there are more supersymmetric particles than unknown parameters, one can write down sum rules relating their masses. We discuss the pectrum of sparticles from this point of view. Some of the sum rules do not depend on the input parameters and can be used to test the consistency of the model, while others are useful in determining the input parameters of the theory. If supersymmetry is discovered but the sum rules turn out to be violated, it will be evidence of new physics beyond the minimal supersymmetric standard model with universal soft supersymmetry-breaking terms. "
"We consider the construction of $SU(2)_{L}\otimes SU(2)_{R}\otimes SU(4)$ partial unification models as an example of phenomenologically acceptable unification models in the absence of supersymmetry in non-commutative geometry. We exploit the Chamseddine, Felder and Fr\""ohlich generalization of the Connes and Lott model building prescription. By introducing a bi-module structure and appropriate permutation symmetries we construct a model with triplet Higgs fields in the $SU(2)$ sectors and spontaneous breaking of $SU(4)$. "
"Gauge fields are described on an Riemann-Cartan space-time by means of tensor-valued differential forms and exterior calculus. It is shown that minimal coupling procedure leads to a gauge invariant theory where gauge fields interact with torsion, and that consistency conditions for the gauge fields impose restrictions in the non-Riemannian structure of space-time. The new results differ from the well established ones obtained by using minimal coupling procedure at the action formulation. The sources of these differences are pointed out and discussed. "
On the basis of the Friedberg-Lee model we formulate a semiclassical transport theory to describe the phase-space evolution of nucleon-nucleon collisions on the quark level. The time evolution is given by a Vlasov-equation for the quark phase-space distribution and a Klein-Gordon equation for the mean-field describing the nucleon as a soliton bag. The Vlasov equation is solved numerically using an extended testparticle method. We test the confinement mechanism and mean-field effects in 1+1 dimensional simulations. 
"A field-enlarging transformation in the chiral electrodynamics is performed. This introduces an additional gauge symmetry to the model that is unitary and anomaly-free and allows for comparison of different models discussed in the literature. The problem of superfluous degrees of freedom and their influence on quantization is discussed. Several ""mysteries"" are explained from this point of view. "
We study the temperature dependence of the Chern-Simons number fluctuations in the SU(2) Higgs Model on Euclidean lattices with spatial sizes up to 20^3. Temperatures well above the Higgs phase transition $T_H$ are achieved on anisotropic lattices. Numerical results are compared to perturbative results on finite lattices as well as in continuum perturbation theory. We find qualitative agreement with perturbative estimates and see at high temperatures a tendency towards static configurations. Up to temperatures $T \simeq 2T_H$ we find indication that tunneling between vacuums with different Chern-Simons numbers are still exponentially suppressed.

"The quantum dynamics of a simplest dissipative system, a particle moving in a constant external field , is exactly studied by taking into account its interaction with a bath of Ohmic spectral density. We apply the main idea and methods developed in our recent work [1] to quantum dissipative system with constant external field. Quantizing the dissipative system we obtain the simple and exact solutions for the coordinate operator of the system in Heisenberg picture and the wave function of the composite system of system and bath in Schroedinger picture. An effective Hamiltonian for the dissipative system is explicitly derived from these solutions with Heisenberg picture method and thereby the meaning of the wavefunction governed by it is clarified by analyzing the effect of the Brownian motion. Especially, the general effective Hamiltonian for the case with arbitrary potential is directly derived with this method for the case when the Brownian motion can be ignored. Using this effective Hamiltonian, we show an interesting fact that the dissipation suppresses the wave packet spreading. "
"We model farinfrared (FIR) spectra of radioweak quasars with the assumption that the emission is from heated dust, and that the heating is due to the central engine via energetic particles. These energetic particles are diffusing from a postulated source near the central engine through a tenuous galactic halo to arrive at the dust which is taken to be in molecular clouds in a disk configuration. This picture does not depend on a particular geometry of the disk such as warps. This concept can readily reproduce the range of observed mm/submm/FIR/IR spectra. "
"In this paper we have examined the internal dynamics of the globular cluster NGC 362. A V band surface brightness profile (SBP) was constructed from CCD images, and, after it was determined that the cluster is not post core-collapse, fit with single- and multi-mass King-Michie (KM) models. The total cluster luminosity is 1.70 $\pm 0.1 \times 10^5$ L$_V$\sol. A total of 285 stellar spectra were obtained of 215 stars for radial velocity determinations. Four stars showed strong evidence for radial velocity variations and are probably members of binary systems. The true cluster binary fraction was determined from simulations to be 0.15 for circular orbits or 0.27 for orbits with a distribution function $f(e) = e$ ($e$ is eccentricity). This relatively high binary detection frequency may indicate that NGC 362 is overabundant in binaries compared to other clusters. The 208 remaining stars showed no sign of rotation. The best agreement with both the kinematic data and the SBP were for shallow mass functions $x = 0.0 - 0.5$ and intermediate amounts of anisotropy in the velocity dispersion tensor. The cluster mass is M = $2.5 - 3.5 \times 10^5$ M\sol\ for a global mass-to-light ratio of M/L$_V$ = 1.5 - 2.0 M\sol/L$_V$\sol. This low value for $x$ is in disagreement with the correlation between $x$ and the height above the Galactic disk seen for a sample of other clusters. The results are also different from the sharp turn-up in the low mass end of mass functions derived from some deep luminosity functions of three other globular clusters. "
We have performed a new exact evaluation of the fluctuation determinant $\kappa$ of the electroweak sphaleron with $\Theta _W =0$. The results differ significantly from a previous calculation of this quantity by Carson et. al. . We find that $\kappa$ is of order 1 in units $(gv)^6$ while the previous results indicated a strong suppression of the sphaleron transition by this factor. 
The influence of excited levels on nonlinear transport properties of a quantum dot weakly coupled to leads is studied using a master--equation approach. A charging model for the dot is compared with a quantum mechanical model for interacting electrons. The current--voltage curve shows Coulomb blockade and additional finestructure that is related to the excited states of the correlated electrons. Unequal coupling to the leads causes asymmetric conductance peaks. Negative differential conductances are predicted due to the existence of excited states with different spins. 
"We give a classification and a construction of all smooth $(n-1)$-dimensional varieties of lines in ${\bf P}\sp n$ verifying that all their lines meet a curve. This also gives a complete classification of $(n-1)$-scrolls over a curve contained in $G(1,n)$. "
"We generalize the Lee-Suzuki iteration method for summing the folded diagram series to the case where the unperturbed model-space energies are non-degenerate. A condition is derived for the convergence of the iteration scheme and this depends on the choice of the model space projection operators. Two choices are examined, in the first the projection operators are defined in terms of the unperturbed states and in the second they are defined in terms of the eigenfunctions obtained at each stage of the iteration. As is illustrated by calculations with a simple model, the second procedure gives the better convergence and, by suitable choice of the starting energies, allows the reproduction of any subset of the exact eigenvalues. "
"We will summarize some aspects of the standard model Higgs boson at high energy $\gamma\gamma$ colliders, where the photon beams are realized by the laser backscattering method, including the direct Higgs boson production via $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow H$, and the measurement of the Yukawa coupling via the channel $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow t\bar tH$. "
The behaviour of test fields near a compact Cauchy horizon is investigated. It is shown that solutions of nonlinear wave equations on Taub spacetime with generic initial data cannot be continued smoothly to both extensions of the spacetime through the Cauchy horizon. This is proved using an energy method. Similar results are obtained for the spacetimes of Moncrief containing a compact Cauchy horizon and for more general matter models. 
"The successful prediction of $\sin^2\theta_W$ suggests that the effective theory beneath the GUT scale is the two-Higgs MSSM. If we further assume that the unified gauge group contains SO(10), that the two light Higgs doublets lie mostly in a single irreducible SO(10) representation, and that the $t$, $b$ and $\tau$ masses originate in renormalizable Yukawa interactions of the form $16_3 O 16_3$, then also the top quark mass can be predicted in terms of the MSSM parameters. To compute $m_t$ we present a precise analytic approximation to the solution of the 2-loop renormalization group equations, and study supersymmetric and GUT threshold corrections and the input value of the $b$ quark mass. The large ratio of top to bottom quark masses derives from a large ratio, $\tan\beta$, of Higgs vacuum expectation values. We point out that when $\tan\beta$ is large, so are certain corrections to the $b$ quark mass prediction, unless a particular hierarchy exists in the parameters of the model. With such a hierarchy, which may result from approximate symmetries, the top mass prediction depends only weakly on the spectrum. Our results may be applied to any supersymmetric SO(10)-like model as long as $\lambda_t\simeq \lambda_b\simeq\lambda_\tau$ at the GUT scale and there are no intermediate mass scales in the desert. "
"We study the motion of surfaces in an intrinsic formulation in which the surface is described by its metric and curvature tensors. The evolution equations for the six quantities contained in these tensors are reduced in number in two cases: (i) for arbitrary surfaces, we use principal coordinates to obtain two equations for the two principal curvatures, highlighting the similarity with the equations of motion of a plane curve; and (ii) for surfaces with spatially constant negative curvature, we use parameterization by Tchebyshev nets to reduce to a single evolution equation. We also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a surface to maintain spatially constant negative curvature as it moves. One choice for the surface's normal motion leads to the modified-Korteweg de Vries equation,the appearance of which is explained by connections to the AKNS hierarchy and the motion of space curves. "
"The Mellin-Barnes representation for the free energy of the genus-$g$ string is constructed. It is shown that the interactions of the open bosonic string do not modify the critical (Hagedorn) temperature. However,for the sectors having a spinor structure, the critical temperature exists also for all $g$ and depends on the windings. The appearance of a periodic structure is briefly discussed. "
"We study the production of gauge boson pairs at the next generation of linear $e^+e^-$ colliders operating in the $e\gamma$ mode. The processes $e\gamma \rightarrow VV^\prime F$ ($V,V^\prime =W$, $Z$, or $\gamma$ and $F=e$ or $\nu$) can give valuable information on possible deviations of the quartic vector boson couplings from the Standard Model predictions. We establish the range of the new couplings that can be explored in these colliders based on a $3\sigma$ effect in the total cross section. We also present several kinematical distributions of the final state particles that could manifest the underlying new dynamics. Our results show that an $e\gamma$ collider can extend considerably the bounds on anomalous interactions coming from oblique radiative corrections and from direct searches in $e^+e^-$ colliders. "
"We consider one dimensional lattice gauge theories constructed by the minimal coupling prescription. It is shown that these theories are exactly solvable in the thermodynamic limit. After considering the most general case, we discuss some special cases on finite lattices, and also work out some examples. There is no phase transition in these minimally coupled theories. "
"In a recent Letter, Gloos et al have suggested that the heavy fermion superconductor, UPd_2Al_3, has a transition in magnetic field from the normal state to an inhomogeneous superconducting state, known as the LOFF state, followed at lower fields by a first order phase transition to the usual flux lattice state. To investigate this, the author derives a formula for the upper critical field for the LOFF state valid at all temperatures in the clean limit (the previous work of Gruenberg and Gunther was restricted to zero temperature), and shows that the LOFF state cannot quantitatively explain the phase diagram for UPd_2Al_3. This indicates that a more general solution which breaks cylindrical symmetry is necessary to explain the data. "
"Not only in physical string theories, but also in some highly simplified situations, background independence has been difficult to understand. It is argued that the ``holomorphic anomaly'' of Bershadsky, Cecotti, Ooguri, and Vafa gives a fundamental explanation of some of the problems. Moreover, their anomaly equation can be interpreted in terms of a rather peculiar quantum version of background independence: in systems afflicted by the anomaly, background independence does not hold order by order in perturbation theory, but the exact partition function as a function of the coupling constants has a background independent interpretation as a state in an auxiliary quantum Hilbert space. The significance of this auxiliary space is otherwise unknown. "
We propose new approach to numerical study of quantum spin systems. Our method is based on a fact that one can use any set of states for the path integral as long as it is complete. We apply our method to one-dimensional quantum spin system with next-to-nearest neighbor interactions. We found remarkable improvement in negative sign problem. 
A regularization for the baryon number consistent with the energy in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is introduced. The soliton solution is constructed with the regularized baryon number constrained to unity. It is furthermore demonstrated that this constraint prevents the soliton from collapsing when scalar fields are allowed to be space dependent. In this scheme the scalar fields actually vanish at the origin reflecting a partial restoration of chiral symmetry. Also the influence of this constraint on some static properties of baryons is discussed. 
"The vacuum-polarization corrections to rates for nuclear-fusion reactions in the $pp$ chain and in the CNO cycle are calculated. For the reactions of particular importance to the solar-neutrino problem, the $\Hethree$, $\Hefour$, $\Be$, and $\Ni$ reactions, we find the magnitude of the effect to be less than 2\%. The effect of VP on all the other reaction rates is expected to be of a similar order of magnitude. We discuss how these results affect the predicted fluxes of solar neutrinos. "
"A recent analysis has shown that it may be possible at the SSC to extract information about $Z'$ couplings via the decay $Z' \to jj$. This technique was found to be useful for some extended electroweak models provided the $Z'$ is relatively light. In the present paper, we generalize this procedure to the LHC and to $Z'$'s which are more massive than 1 TeV. (Contributed to the {\it Proceedings of the Workshop on Physics at Current Accelerators and the Supercollider}, Argonne National Laboratory, June 2-5, 1993.) "
"We present new results for the current as a function of transmission rate in the one dimensional totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) with a blockage that lowers the jump rate at one site from one to r < 1. Exact finite volume results serve to bound the allowed values for the current in the infinite system. This proves the existence of a gap in allowed density corresponding to a nonequilibrium ``phase transition'' in the infinite system. A series expansion in r, derived from the finite systems, is proven to be asymptotic for all sufficiently large systems. Pade approximants based on this series, which make specific assumptions about the nature of the singularity at r = 1, match numerical data for the ``infinite'' system to a part in 10^4. "
"We consider the compactification of the dual form of $N=1$ $D=10$ supergravity on a six-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold. An $N=1$ off-shell supergravity effective Lagrangian in four dimensions can be constructed in a dual version of the gravitational sector (new-minimal supergravity form). Superspace duality has a simple interpretation in terms of Poincar\'{e} duality of two-form cohomology. The resulting $4D$ Lagrangian may describe the low-energy point-field limit of a five-brane theory, dual to string theory, provided Calabi-Yau spaces are consistent vacua of such dual theory. "
"Three different methods viz. i) a perturbative analysis of the Schr\""odinger equation ii) abstract differential geometric method and iii) a semiclassical reduction of the Wheeler-Dewitt equation, relating Pancharatnam phase to vacuum instability are discussed. An improved semiclassical reduction is also shown to yield the correct zeroth order semicalssical Einstein equations with backreaction. This constitutes an extension of our earlier discussions on the topic "
"A number of examples of Hamiltonian systems that are integrable by classical means are cast within the framework of isospectral flows in loop algebras. These include: the Neumann oscillator, the cubically nonlinear Schr\""odinger systems and the sine-Gordon equation. Each system has an associated invariant spectral curve and may be integrated via the Liouville-Arnold technique. The linearizing map is the Abel map to the associated Jacobi variety, which is deduced through separation of variables in hyperellipsoidal coordinates. More generally, a family of moment maps is derived, identifying certain finite dimensional symplectic manifolds with rational coadjoint orbits of loop algebras. Integrable Hamiltonians are obtained by restriction of elements of the ring of spectral invariants to the image of these moment maps. The isospectral property follows from the Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem, and gives rise to invariant spectral curves. {\it Spectral Darboux coordinates} are introduced on rational coadjoint orbits, generalizing the hyperellipsoidal coordinates to higher rank cases. Applying the Liouville-Arnold integration technique, the Liouville generating function is expressed in completely separated form as an abelian integral, implying the Abel map linearization in the general case. "
"In this letter, we show that coherent structures are related to folds of horseshoes which are present in chaotic systems. We develop techniques that allow us to construct coherent structures by manipulating folds in three prototypical problems: a 1-D chaotic map, a 2-D chaotic map, and a chaotically advected fluid. The ability to construct such structures is of practical importance for the control of chaotic or turbulent extended systems such as fluids, plasmas, and coupled oscillator arrays. "
"The combined use of chiral $SU(3)$ and heavy quark symmetries allows one to relate the hadronic form factors for the decay $\bar B\to \bar K\e^+\e^-$ to those for $\bar B\to\pi\e^-\bar\nu$. We investigate departures from the symmetry limit which arise from chiral symmetry breaking. The analysis uses chiral perturbation theory and the heavy quark limit to compute the relevant hadronic matrix elements. We estimate the size of $SU(3)$ corrections by computing, at one loop order, the leading nonanalytic dependence on the light quark masses. The calculation is trustworthy only in the portion of the Dalitz plot in which the momentum of the kaon or pion is small. We find the corrections to be~$\sim40\%$. "
"We study density waves in the flows of granular particles through vertical tubes and hoppers using both analytic methods and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We construct equations of motion for quasi one-dimensional systems. The equations, combined with the Bagnold's law for friction, are used to describe the time evolutions of the density and the velocity fields for narrow tubes and hoppers. The solutions of the equations can have two types of density waves, kinetic and dynamic. For tubes, we can show the existence of kinetic waves, and obtain the condition for dynamic waves for tubes from the equations. For hoppers, we obtain the solutions of the equations up to the first order of the opening angle, which also show the existence of kinetic waves. We reproduce density waves in the MD simulations for tubes. The waves are believed to be kinetic based on a few evidences, including a well defined flux-density curve. In MD simulations of flows in hoppers, we find density waves, which are also believed to be kinetic. "
"Using a recent classification of local symmetries of the vacuum Einstein equations, it is shown that there can be no observables for the vacuum gravitational field (in a closed universe) built as spatial integrals of local functions of Cauchy data and their derivatives. "
"We present partial numerical results in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with soft breaking of supersymmetry, and radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry. We impose the additional relation, bottom mass = tau mass at the GUT scale. For the special case of the strict no-scale model, in which global supersymmetry breaking arises solely from soft gaugino masses, we find that the top mass is expected to be lighter than about 128 GeV. A higher upper bound for the top mass of about 138 GeV is predicted, if the mass of the bottom is at the lower end of its experimental uncertainty. "
"We use single-cluster Monte Carlo simulations to study the role of topological defects in the three-dimensional classical Heisenberg model on simple cubic lattices of size up to $80^3$. By applying reweighting techniques to time series generated in the vicinity of the approximate infinite volume transition point $K_c$, we obtain clear evidence that the temperature derivative of the average defect density $d\langle n \rangle/dT$ behaves qualitatively like the specific heat, i.e., both observables are finite in the infinite volume limit. This is in contrast to results by Lau and Dasgupta [{\em Phys. Rev.\/} {\bf B39} (1989) 7212] who extrapolated a divergent behavior of $d\langle n \rangle/dT$ at $K_c$ from simulations on lattices of size up to $16^3$. We obtain weak evidence that $d\langle n \rangle/dT$ scales with the same critical exponent as the specific heat.As a byproduct of our simulations, we obtain a very accurate estimate for the ratio $\alpha/\nu$ of the specific-heat exponent with the correlation-length exponent from a finite-size scaling analysis of the energy. "
"We present evidence for a novel finite-temperature phase transition in the phason elasticity of quasicrystals. A tiling model for energetically stabilized decagonal quasicrystals has been studied in an extensive series of Monte Carlo simulation. Hamiltonian (energetics) of the model is given by nearest-neighbor Penrose-like matching rules between three dimensional unit cells. A new order parameter and diagnostics have been introduced. We show that a transition from locked phason to unlocked phason dynamics occurs at finite temperature. In the unlocked phase, phasons can be thermodynamically excited even though the quasicrystal is energetically stabilized at low temperatures. "
"It is shown that $SL(n,R)$ KdV hierarchy can be expressed as definite nonpolynomials in Kac Moody currents and their derivatives by the action of Borel subgroup of $SL(n,R)$ on the phase space of centrally extended $sl(n,R)$ Kac Moody currents. Construction of Lax pair is shown, confirming Drinfeld Sokolov type Hamiltonian reduction. This suggests an example of a moduli space with symplectic structure corresponding to extended conformal symmetries. "
Any quantum theory of gravity which treats the gravitational constant as a dynamical variable has to address the issue of superpositions of states corresponding to different eigenvalues. We show how the unobservability of such superpositions can be explained through the interaction with other gravitational degrees of freedom (decoherence). The formal framework is canonically quantized Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. We discuss the concepts of intrinsic time and semiclassical time as well as the possibility of tunneling into regions corresponding to a negative gravitational constant. We calculate the reduced density matrix of the Jordan-Brans-Dicke field and show that the off-diagonal elements can be sufficiently suppressed to be consistent with experiments. The possible relevance of this mechanism for structure formation in extended inflation is briefly discussed. 
"(substantial changes to section 3.2, otherwise minor) We present an analysis of the hydrodynamic stability of a cold slab bounded by two accretion shocks. Previous numerical work has shown that when the Mach number of the shock is large the slab is unstable. Here we show that to linear order both the bending and breathing modes of such a slab are stable. However, nonlinear effects will tend to soften the restoring forces for bending modes, and when the slab displacement is comparable to its thickness this gives rise to a nonlinear instability. The growth rate of the instability, above this threshold but for small bending angles, is $\sim c_sk (k\eta)^{1/2}$, where $\eta$ is the slab displacement. When the bending angle is large the slab will contain a local vorticity comparable to $c_s/L$, where $L$ is the slab thickness. We discuss the implications of this work for gravitational instabilities of slabs. Finally, we examine the cases of a decelerating slab bounded by a single shock and a stationary slab bounded on one side by thermal pressure. The latter case is stable, but appears to be a special case. The former case is subject to a nonlinear overstability driven by deceleration effects. We conclude that shock bounded slabs with a high density compression ratio generically produce substructure with a strong local shear, a bulk velocity dispersion like the sound speed in the cold layer and a characteristic scale comparable to the slab thickness. "
"Two new exact analytical solutions of the euclidean Einstein equations for a minimal massless scalar field and negative cosmological constant have been obtained. These solutions are given in terms of Jacobian elliptic or circular functions, rather than hyperbolic functions, connect large asymptotic regions of maximally-symmetric anti-DeSitter metrics through a microscopic throat, and correspond to negative definite components of the Ricci tensor. Therefore, they describe wormhole-like changes of topology driven by nucleation of baby universes. The quantum state of such elliptic and circular wormholes or handles is discussed in the most interesting inner and asymptotic regions. "
"We review the status of theoretical predictions for W-pair production at high energies. We discuss a systematic scenario towards a Monte-Carlo generator for e^+e^- --> 4f(\gamma), which meets the experimental requirements. In particular we summarize the recent developments in this field. "
"We show that any covariant scattering amplitude of the $W_3$ string will contain, as part of its integrand, a factor that obeys the differential equations satisfied by an Ising model correlation function. This factor can thus be identified with such a correlation function, in agreement with a previous result of the authors. The $W_3$ string is also shown to contain an $N=2$ parafermion theory, and hence to contain in addition the non-linear infinite-dimensional $W$-algebra corresponding to this parafermion theory. The physical states form a representation of this algebra. "
"$CP$ violating effects in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) can lead to excessively large contributions to the neutron EDM (\dn). We write criteria which ensure that the low energy supergravity (SUGRA) parametrization of the MSSM does not require fine-tunings or large mass scales to evade the constraint from \dn, and consider the implications on SUGRA theories. In particular, we show that in the Polonyi model, two of the mass scales are in general complex, meaning that model does not naturally avoid a large \dn\ as is sometimes claimed. "
"The specific nonlinear vector $\sigma$-model coupled to Einstein gravity is investigated. The model arises in the studies of the gravitating matter in non-commutative geometry. The static spherically symmetric spacetimes are identified by direct solving of the field equations. The asymptotically flat black hole with the ``non-commutative'' vector hair appears for the special choice of the integration constants, giving thus another counterexample to the famous ``no-hair'' theorem. "
"This paper generalizes classical results of Griffiths, Dolgachev and Steenbrink on the cohomology of hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces. Given a $d$-dimensional projective simplicial toric variety $P$ and an ample hypersurface $X$ defined by an polynomial $f$ in the homogeneous coordinate ring $S$ of $P$ (as defined in an earlier paper of the first author), we show that the graded pieces of the Hodge filtration on $H^d(P - X)$ are naturally isomorphic to certain graded pieces of $S/J(f)$, where $J(f)$ is the Jacobian ideal of $f$. We then discuss how this relates to the primitive cohomology of $X$. Also, if $T$ is the torus contained in $X$, then the intersection of $X$ and $T$ is an affine hypersurface in $T$, and we show how recent results of the second author can be stated using various ideals in the ring $S$. To prove our results, we must give a careful description (in terms of $S$) of $d$-forms and $(d-1)$-forms on the toric variety $P$. For completeness, we also provide a proof of the Bott-Steenbrink-Danilov vanishing theorem for simplicial toric varieties. Other topics considered in the paper include quasi-smooth hypersurfaces and $V$-submanifolds, the structure of the complement of $U$ when $P$ is represented as the quotient of an open subset $U$ of affine space, a generalization of the Euler exact sequence on projective space, and the relation between graded pieces of $R/J(f)$ and the moduli of ample hypersurfaces in $P$. "
"To test a multicluster approach for halo nuclei, we give a unified description for the ground states of $^6$He and $^8$He in a model comprising an $\alpha$ cluster and single-neutron clusters. The intercluster wave function is taken a superposition of terms belonging to different arrangements, each defined by a set of Jacobi coordinates. Each term is then a superposition of products of gaussian functions of the individual Jacobi coordinates with different widths, projected to angular momenta $l=0$ or 1. To avoid excessively large dimensions and ``overcompleteness"", stochastic methods were tested for selecting the gaussians spanning the basis. For $^6$He, we were able to calculate ground-state energies that are virtully exact within the subspace defined by the arrangements and $l$ values, and we found that preselected random sets of bases (with or without simulated annealing) yield excellent numerical convergence to this ``exact"" value with thoroughly truncated bases. For $^8$He good energy convergence was achieved in a state space comprising three arrangements with all $l=0$, and there are indications showing that the contributions of other subspaces are likely to be small. The $^6$He and $^8$He energies are reproduced by the same effective force very well, and the matter radii obtained are similar to those of other sophisticated calculations. "
"*REVISED VERSION* Two quark propagators with different analytic structure are employed in on and off mass-shell Bethe-Salpeter type equations for the pion and scalar diquark form-factors. One of the quark propagators has been calculated with the inclusion of a trivial quark-gluon vertex and, as a consequence, contains a complex conjugate pair of logarithmic branch points. The other quark propagator includes a non-trivial vertex ansatz and is entire, with an essential singularity at infinity. The different quark propagators lead to qualitatively different diquark form-factors. "
"The presence of protostellar disks can greatly increase the dissipation during close stellar encounters, leading to the formation of a significant population of binaries during the initial collapse and virialization of a cluster. We have used N-body simulations of collapsing globular clusters to find the major factors that determine the efficiency of binary formation through star-disk captures. This work serves the dual purpose of verifying the results of earlier analytic work as well as examining parameters not testable by that work. As in the earlier work, typical binary fractions of a few percent are found. For the parameters studied, the results are found to depend remarkably little upon disk evolution, the mass distribution of the stars, or their spatial distribution, though distributions in which the stars are highly clumped yield binary fractions larger by a factor of a few. The direct N-body integrations limit the models to relatively small values of N. Semiempirical relations are derived, however, which allow the results to be extrapolated to values of N appropriate to globular clusters. "
"For a generic $\Ww$ algebra, we give an algorithmic procedure for factoring out all fields of dimension $1/2$, both bosonic and fermionic, and some fields of dimension $1$. This generalizes and makes more explicit the Goddard-Schwimmer theorem for free fermions. We also show how the induced gravity theory for the original $\Ww$ algebra containing the free fields relates to the theory where the fields are factored out. "
"We analyze the subdivision properties of certain lattice gauge theories for the discrete abelian groups $Z_{p}$, in four dimensions. In these particular models we show that the Boltzmann weights are invariant under all $(k,l)$ subdivision moves, when the coupling scale is a $p$th root of unity. For the case of manifolds with boundary, we demonstrate analytically that Alexander type $2$ and $3$ subdivision of a bounding simplex is equivalent to the insertion of an operator which equals a delta function on trivial bounding holonomies. The four dimensional model then gives rise to an effective gauge invariant three dimensional model on its boundary, and we compute the combinatorially invariant value of the partition function for the case of $S^{3}$ and $S^{2}\times S^{1}$. "
"We discuss the process by which energy, initially evenly distributed in a nonlinear lattice, can localize itself into large amplitude excitations. We show that, the standard modulational instability mechanism, which can initiate the process by the formation of small amplitude breathers, is completed efficiently, in the presence of discreteness, by energy exchange mechanisms between the nonlinear excitations which favor systematically the growth of the larger excitations. The process is however self regulated because the large amplitude excitations are finally trapped by the Peierls-Nabarro potential. "
We explicitly write dowm integral formulas for solutions to Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations with coefficients in non-bounded -- neither highest nor lowest weight -- $\gtsl_{n+1}$-modules. The formulas are closely related to WZNW model at a rational level. 
"We study a family of modules over Kac-Moody algebras realized in multi-valued functions on a flag manifold and find integral representations for intertwining operators acting on these modules. These intertwiners are related to some expressions involving complex powers of Lie algebra generators. When applied to affine Lie algebras, these expressions give integral formulas for correlation functions with values in not necessarily highest weight modules. We write related formulas out in an explicit form in the case of $\hat{\gtsl_{2}}$. The latter formulas admit q-deformation producing an integral representation of q-correlation functions. We also discuss a relation of complex powers of Lie algebra (quantum group) generators and Casimir operators to ($q-$)special functions. "
We introduce and study action of quantum groups on skew polynomial rings and related rings of quotients. This leads to a ``q-deformation'' of the Gel'fand-Kirillov conjecture which we partially prove. We propose a construction of automorphisms of certain non-commutaive rings of quotients coming from complex powers of quantum group generators; this is applied to explicit calculation of singular vectors in Verma modules over $U_{q}(\gtsl_{n+1})$. We finally give a definition of a $q-$connection with coefficients in a ring of skew polynomials and study the structure of quantum group modules twisted by a $q-$connection. 
"The rate of the emission of the high energy low-mass dileptons from the QGP is found in the first nonvanishing order with respect to strong coupling. We base on the real-time kinetic approach [2] without an explicit assumption about a complete thermal equilibrium in the emitting system. For the class of the partons distributions which may simulate that of the ""hot glue scenario""[1] the rate of emission is found analytically . ( Figures can be obtained from the author ) "
"The true variables in QED are the transverse photon components and Dirac's physical electron, constructed out of the fermionic field and the longitudinal components of the photon. We calculate the propagators in terms of these variables to one loop and demonstrate their gauge invariance. The physical electron propagator is shown not to suffer from infrared divergences in any gauge. In general, all physical Green's functions are gauge invariant and infrared-finite. "
"We propose a topological version of four-dimensional (Euclidean) Einstein gravity, in which anti-self-dual 2-forms and an SU(2) connection are used as fundamental fields. The theory describes the moduli space of conformally self-dual Einstein manifolds. In the presence of a cosmological constant, we evaluate the index of the elliptic complex associated with the moduli space. "
"The contribution of gravitational wave (tensor metric) and energy density (scalar metric) fluctuations to the cosmic microwave background polarization is computed by numerically solving the relativistic radiation transfer equations. We find that the tensor contribution is significant only at large angular scales (multipoles $\ell \lta 40$). For standard recombination, the tensor contribution can dominate at $\ell \lta 40$; however, the effect would be difficult to detect since the total (scalar plus tensor) polarization is $< 1$\%. For models with late reionization, the total large angular scale polarization is large ($\sim 7-9$\%), but the tensor fraction is negligibly small. Hence, polarization may be useful for discriminating ionization history, but is much less promising as a means for detecting tensor fluctuations. "
We demonstrate that QED exhibits a previously unobserved symmetry. Some consequences are discussed. 
"We examine gravitational waves in an isolated axi--symmetric reflexion symmetric NGT system. The structure of the vacuum field equations is analyzed and the exact solutions for the field variables in the metric tensor are found in the form of expansions in powers of a radial coordinate. We find that in the NGT axially symmetric case the mass of the system remains constant only if the system is static (as it necessarily is in the case of spherical symmetry). If the system radiates, then the mass decreases monotonically and the energy flux associated with waves is positive. "
"We demonstrate that expected efficiencies and purities for $b$-tagging at SSC/LHC detectors should allow detection of at least one of the Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model in $t\anti t$~Higgs production, with Higgs$\rta b\anti b$ decay, over a substantial range of supersymmetric parameter space. In particular, with the addition of this mode to those previously considered, there is no region of supersymmetric parameter space for which {\it none} of the Higgs bosons of the model can be seen at the SSC/LHC. "
"Taking the induced action for gauge fields coupled to affine currents as an example, we show how loop calculations in non-local two-dimensional field theories can be regulated. Our regularisation method for one loop is based on the method of Pauli and Villars. We use it to calculate the renormalisation factors for the corresponding effective actions, clearing up some discrepancies in the literature. In particular, it will be shown explicitly that vector gauge transformation invariance and Haar invariance of functional integral measures impose different requirements, but they are related by a counterterm (which is local in terms of group variables). For higher loops, we use the method of covariant derivatives combined with Pauli-Villars to argue that the one loop result remains unaltered. "
"Properties and experimental predictions of a broad class of supergravity grand unified models possessing an $SU(5)$-type proton decay and $R$ parity are described. Models of this type can be described in terms of four parameters at the Gut scale in addition to those of the Standard Model i.e. $m_o$ (universal scalar mass), $m_{1/2}$ (universal gaugino mass), $A_o$ (cubic soft breaking parameter) and $\tan\beta=<H_2>/<H_1>$. Thus the 32 SUSY masses can be expressed in terms of $m_o, m_{1/2}, A_o \tan\beta$ and the as yet unknown t-quark mass $m_t$. Gut thresholds are examined and a simple model leads to grand unification consistent with $p$-decay data when $0.114<\alpha_3 (M_z)<0.135$, in agreement with current values of $\alpha_3 (M_Z)$.Proton decay is examined for the superheavy Higgs triplet mass $M_{H_3}<10M_G(M_G\simeq 1.5 \times10^{16}$~GeV) and squarks and gluinos lighter than 1 TeV. Throughout most of the parameter space chargino-neutralino scaling relations are predicted to hold: $2m_{\tilde{Z}_1}\cong m_{\tilde{W}_1}\cong m_{\tilde{Z}_2}, m_{\tilde{W}_1}\simeq(1/4)m_{\tilde{g}}$ (for $\mu>0$) or $m_{\tilde{W}_1} \simeq(1/3)m_{\tilde{g}}$ (for $\mu<0$), while $m_{\tilde{W}_2}\cong m_{\tilde{Z}_3}\cong m_{\tilde{Z}_4}>>m_{\tilde{Z}_1}$. Future proton decay experiments combined with LEP2 lead to further predictions, e.g. for the entire parameter space either proton decay should be seen at these or the$\tilde{W}_1$ seen at LEP2. Relic density constraints on the $\tilde{Z}_1$ further constrain the parameter space e.g. so that $m_t<165$~GeV, $m_h<105$~GeV, $m_{\tilde{W}_1} <100$~GeV and $m_{\tilde{Z}_1}<50$~GeV when $M_{H_3}/M_G < 6$.

"We review the current status of heavy quark symmetry and its applications to weak decays of hadrons containing a single heavy quark. After an introduction to the underlying physical ideas, we discuss in detail the formalism of the heavy quark effective theory, including a comprehensive treatment of symmetry breaking corrections. We then illustrate some nonperturbative approaches, which aim at a dynamical, QCD-based calculation of the universal form factors of the effective theory. The main focus is on results obtained using QCD sum rules. Finally, we perform an essentially model-independent analysis of semileptonic $B$ meson decays in the context of the heavy quark effective theory. "
"We derive an equation which gives the tree-level scattering amplitudes for tachyons in the black hole background using the exact states of the collective field hamiltonian corresponding to a deformed matrix model recently proposed by Jevicki and Yoneya. Using directly the symmetry algebra we obtain explicit expression for a class of amplitudes in the tree approximation. We also study the quantum effects in the corresponding collective field theory. In particular, we compute the ground state energy and the free energy at finite temperature up to two loops, and the first quantum correction to the two-point function. "
"We investigate the stability of large-scale structures in Burgers' equation under the perturbation of high wave-number noise in the initial conditions. Analytical estimates are obtained for random initial data with spatial spectral density k^n, n < 1. Numerical investigations are performed for the case n=0, using a parallel implementation of the Fast Legendre Transform. "
"We present a new scheme to extract numerically ``optimal'' interatomic potentials from large amounts of data produced by first-principles calculations. The method is based on fitting the potential to ab initio atomic forces of many atomic configurations, including surfaces, clusters, liquids and crystals at finite temperature. The extensive data set overcomes the difficulties encountered by traditional fitting approaches when using rich and complex analytic forms, allowing to construct potentials with a degree of accuracy comparable to that obtained by ab initio methods. A glue potential for aluminum obtained with this method is presented and discussed. "
An algorithm for Monte Carlo simulations is proposed in which the parameter controlling the strength of the transition becomes a dynamical variable and in which efficient transitions are achieved by cluster steps. It allows to avoid the strongly suppressed tunneling between the phases by travelling easily via the second order region. Numerical results for the Potts model are presented which demonstrate the advantages of the method. 
"Simulation results of Ising systems for several update rules, observables, and dimensions are analyzed. The lattice-size dependence is discussed for the autocorrelation times and for the weights of eigenvalues, giving fit results in the case of power laws. Implications of spectral properties are pointed out and the behavior of a particular observable not governed by detailed balance is explained. "
"The finite form of the $N=2$ super-Weyl transformations in the chiral and twisted-chiral irreducible formulations of the two-dimensional $N=2$ superfield supergravity are found in $N=2$ superspace. The super-Weyl anomaly of the $N=2$ extended fermionic string theory is computed in terms of the $N=2$ superfields, by using a short time expansion of the $N=2$ chiral heat kernel. The super-Weyl invariant $N=2$ superconformal structure is introduced, and a new definition of the $N=2$ super-Riemannian surfaces is proposed. "
In this talk I want to explain the operator substractions needed to regularize gauge currents in a second quantized theory. The case of space-time dimension $3+1$ is considered in detail. In presence of chiral fermions the regularization effects a modification of the local commutation relations of the currents by local Schwinger terms. In $1+1$ dimensions one gets the usual central extension (Schwinger term does not depend on background gauge field) whereas in $3+1$ dimensions one gets an anomaly linear in the background potential. 
It is shown how the canonical symmetry is used to look for the hierarchy of the Hamiltonian operators relevant to the system under consideration. It appears that only the invariance condition can be used to solve the problem. 
"We calculate the effective action of a superconductor, without assuming that either the electron-electron potential or the Fermi surface obey rotational invariance. This approach leads to the same gap equation and equilibrium free energy as more conventional methods. The results are used to obtain the Gell-Mann - Low renormalization group equations for the electron-electron potential. "
"Recently, a class of interaction round the face (IRF) solvable lattice models were introduced, based on any rational conformal field theory (RCFT). We investigate here the connection between the general solvable IRF models and the fusion ones. To this end, we introduce an associative algebra associated to any graph, as the algebra of products of the eigenvalues of the incidence matrix. If a model is based on an RCFT, its associated graph algebra is the fusion ring of the RCFT. A number of examples are studied. The Gordon--generalized IRF models are studied, and are shown to come from RCFT, by the graph algebra construction. The IRF models based on the Dynkin diagrams of A-D-E are studied. While the $A$ case stems from an RCFT, it is shown that the $D-E$ cases do not. The graph algebras are constructed, and it is speculated that a natural isomorphism relating these to RCFT exists. The question whether all solvable IRF models stems from an RCFT remains open, though the $D-E$ cases shows that a mixing of the primary fields is needed. "
We propose an algebraic description of the geometric structure of baryons in terms of the algebra $U(7)$. We construct a mass operator that preserves the threefold permutational symmetry and discuss a collective model of baryons with the geometry of an oblate top. 
"We present a powerful method for calculating the thermodynamic properties of the Hubbard model in infinite dimensions, using an exact diagonalization of an Anderson model with a finite number of sites. At finite temperatures, the explicit diagonalization of the Anderson Hamiltonian allows the calculation of Green's functions with a resolution far superior to that of Quantum Monte Carlo calculations. At zero temperature, the Lancz\`os method is used and yields the essentially exact zero-temperature solution of the model, except in a region of very small frequencies. Numerical results for the half-filled case in the paramagnetic phase (quasi-particle weight, self-energy, and also real-frequency spectral densities) are presented. "
"We apply an exact diagonalization method to the the infinite-D two-band Hubbard model. The method is essentially exact for the calculation of thermodynamic properties for all but the smallest frequencies and yields a resolution unavailable in Monte Carlo calculations. We establish the instability of the normal state with respect to singlet superconductivity at small frequencies at small doping, the regime of relevance for High-$T_c$ superconductors. We also present evidence for the existence of an instability towards triplet superconductivity in the large doping regime $n \sim 2$. "
"We give a complete classification of all simple current modular invariants, extending previous results for $(\Zbf_p)^k$ to arbitrary centers. We obtain a simple explicit formula for the most general case. Using orbifold techniques to this end, we find a one-to-one correspondence between simple current invariants and subgroups of the center with discrete torsions. As a by-product, we prove the conjectured monodromy independence of the total number of such invariants. The orbifold approach works in a straightforward way for symmetries of odd order, but some modifications are required to deal with symmetries of even order. With these modifications the orbifold construction with discrete torsion is complete within the class of simple current invariants. Surprisingly, there are cases where discrete torsion is a necessity rather than a possibility. "
"T-Duality invariant worldsheet string actions, recently written down by Schwarz and Sen, are coupled to the worldsheet gauge fields. It is shown that the integration of the dual coordinates gives the conventional, vector, axial and chiral, gauged string actions for the appropriate choice of the gauged isometries. Alternatively, the gauge field integration is shown to give a T-duality invariant action which matches with the corresponding results known earlier. "
"This is the first part of an investigation concerning the formulation of 2D gravity in the framework of the uniformization theory of Riemann surfaces. As a first step in this direction we show that the classical Liouville action appears in the expression of the correlators of topological gravity. Next we derive an inequality involving the cutoff of 2D gravity and the background geometry. Another result, always related to uniformization theory, concerns a relation between the higher genus normal ordering and the Liouville action. Furthermore, we show that the chirally split anomaly of CFT is equivalent to the Krichever-Novikov cocycle. By means of the inverse map of uniformization we give a realization of the Virasoro algebra on arbitrary Riemann surfaces and find the eigenfunctions for {\it holomorphic} covariant operators defining higher order cocycles and anomalies which are related to $W$-algebras. Finally we attack the problem of considering the positivity of $e^\sigma$, with $\sigma$ the Liouville field, by proposing an explicit construction for the Fourier modes on compact Riemann surfaces. "
"The Batalin--Vilkovisky (BV) formalism is a useful framework to study gauge theories. We summarize a simple procedure to find a a gauge--fixed action in this language and a way to obtain one--loop anomalies. Calculations involving the antifields can be greatly simplified by using a theorem on the antibracket cohomology. The latter is based on properties of a `Koszul--Tate differential', namely its acyclicity and nilpotency. We present a new proof for this acyclicity, respecting locality and covariance of the theory. This theorem then implies that consistent higher ghost terms in various expressions exist, and it avoids tedious calculations. This is illustrated in chiral $W_3$ gravity. We compute the one--loop anomaly without terms of negative ghost number. Then the mentioned theorem and the consistency condition imply that the full anomaly is determined up to local counterterms. Finally we show how to implement background charges into the BV language in order to cancel the anomaly with the appropriate counterterms. Again we use the theorem to simplify the calculations, which agree with previous results. "
"CP violation in the decays $t \to \ell^+\nu b$ and $\bar t \to \ell^-\bar\nu \bar b$ from the production process $e^-e^+ \to \ttbar$ is discussed. Since the asymmetry proposed as a measure of CP violation vanishes even at the one-loop level in the Standard Model (SM), it may be a useful tool to search for sources of CP violation outside of the SM. As an illustration the asymmetry has been computed within supersymmetric extensions of the SM. Prospects for its measurement at future high-energy linear colliders are discussed. "
"In a previous paper we have shown how, for bosonic fields, the generating functional in both relativistic quantum field theory and thermal field theory can be evaluated by use of a standard quantum mechanical path integral. In this paper we extend this method to include fermionic fields. A particular problem is posed by Green's functions with external fermionic lines, where the different boundary conditions of bosons and fermions in imaginary time have to be accommodated within one path integral expression. The general procedure is worked out in the example of scalar and spinor self-energies in a simple model with a Yukawa coupling of a scalar to a Majorana spinor. "
"A definition of quantum mechanics on a manifold $ M $ is proposed and a method to realize the definition is presented. This scheme is applicable to a homogeneous space $ M = G / H $. The realization is a unitary representation of the transformation group $ G $ on the space of vector bundle-valued functions. When $ H \ne \{ e \} $, there exist a number of inequivalent realizations. As examples, quantum mechanics on a sphere $ S^n $, a torus $ T^n $ and a projective space $ \RP $ are studied. In any case, it is shown that there are an infinite number of inequivalent realizations. "
"We discuss vector, axial-vector, scalar and pseudoscalar two-point functions at low and intermediate energies. We first review what is known from chiral perturbation theory, as well as from a heat kernel expansion within the context of the extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (ENJL) model of ref. \cite{12}. In this work we derive then these two-point functions to all orders in the momenta and to leading order in $1/N_c$. We find an improved high-energy behaviour and a general way of parametrizing them that shows relations between some of the two-point functions, which are also valid in the presence of gluonic interactions. The similarity between the shape of the experimentally known spectral functions and the ones we derive, is greatly improved with respect to those predicted by the usual constituent quark like models. We also obtain the scalar mass $M_S = 2 M_Q$ independent of the regularization scheme. In the end, we calculate fully an example of a nonleptonic matrix element in the ENJL--model, the $\pi^+-\pi^0$ electromagnetic mass difference and find good agreement with the measured value. "
"As shown by Ashtekar in the mid 80's, general relativity can be extended to incorporate degenerate metrics. This extension is not unique, however, as one can change the form of the hamiltonian constraints and obtain an {\it alternative} degenerate extension of general relativity that disagrees with Ashtekar's original theory when the triads vectors are degenerate. In this paper, the constraint algebra of a particular alternative theory is explicitly evaluated and compared with that of Ashtekar's original degenerate extension. A generic classification of the difference between the two theories is given in terms of the degeneracy and surface-forming properties of the triad vectors. (This classification is valid when the degeneracy and surface-forming properties of the triad vectors is the same everywhere in an open set about a point in space.) If the triad vectors are degenerate and surface-forming, then all the secondary constraints of the alternative degenerate extension are satisfied as a consequence of the primary constraints, and the constraints of this theory are weaker than those of Ashtekar's. If the degenerate triad vectors are not surface-forming, then the first secondary constraint of the alternative theory already implies equivalence with Ashtekar's degenerate extension. What happens when the degeneracy and surface-forming properties of the triad vectors change from point to point is an open question. "
"Gravitational collapse of the cylindrical elongated cloud is studied by numerical magnetohydrodynamical simulations. In the infinitely long cloud in hydrostatic configuration, small perturbations grow by the gravitational instability. The most unstable mode indicated by a linear perturbation theory grows selectively even from a white noise. The growth rate agrees with that calculated by the linear theory. First, the density-enhanced region has an elongated shape, i.e., prolate spheroidal shape. As the collapse proceeds, the high-density fragment begins to contract mainly along the symmetry axis. Finally, a spherical core is formed in the non-magnetized cloud. In contrast, an oblate spheroidal dense disk is formed in a cloud in which the magnetic pressure is nearly equal to the thermal one. The radial size of the disk becomes proportional to the initial characteristic density scale-height in the r-direction. As the collapse proceeds, a slowly contracting dense part is formed (approximately < 10% in mass) inside of the fast contracting disk. And this is separated from other part of the disk whose inflow velocity is accelerated as reaching the center of the core. From arguments on the Jeans mass and the magnetic critical mass, it is concluded that the fragments formed in a cylindrical elongated cloud can not be supported against the self- gravity and it will eventually collapse. "
"We reanalyse theoretical considerations and experimental data, in an attempt to decide hether there is another scale in the fractional quantum Hall effect problem, in addition to the magnetic scale defined by the magnetic length $a_c$ or the cyclotron energy $\hbar \omega_c$. We then discuss possible implications of a new scale on the formulation of a theoretical model of the fractional quantum Hall effect. "
We develop the formulation of turbulence in terms of the functional integral over the phase space configurations of the vortex cells. The phase space consists of Clebsch coordinates at the surface of the vortex cells plus the Lagrange coordinates of this surface plus the conformal metric. Using the Hamiltonian dynamics we find an invariant probability distribution which satisfies the Liouville equation. The violations of the time reversal invariance come from certain topological terms in effective energy of our Gibbs-like distribution. We study the topological aspects of the statistics and use the string theory methods to estimate intermittency. 
"We study on-shell and off-shell properties of the supersymmetric sinh-Gordon and perturbed SUSY Yang-Lee models using the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and form factors. Identifying the supersymmetric models with the Eight Vertex Free Fermion Model, we derive inversion relation for inhomogeneous transfer matrix and TBA equations and get correct UV results. We obtain two-point form factors of the trace of energy-momentum tensor using the Watson equations and their SUSY transformations. As an application, we compute the UV central charge using these form factors and spectral representation of the $C$-theorem. "
"The contributions to the $g-2$ of the muon from some eighth-order (four-loop) graphs containing one-loop and two-loop vacuum polarization insertions have been evaluated analytically in QED perturbation theory, expanding the results in the ratio of the electron to muon mass ${(m_e / m_\mu)}$. The results agree with the numerical evaluations and the asymptotic analytical results already existing in the literature. "
"We present a complete calculation of the cross section for neutralino annihilation into the two-gluon final state. This channel can be quite important for the phenomenology of neutralino annihilation due to the well-known helicity suppression of neutralino annihilation into light quarks and leptons. In addition, we calculate the cross section for annihilation of neutralinos into a gluon and quark-antiquark pair, and discuss QCD corrections to the tree-level cross sections for neutralino annihilation into quarks. If the neutralino is lighter than the top quark, the effect of these results on high-energy neutrino signals from neutralino annihilation in the Sun and in the Earth can be significant, especially if the neutralino is primarily gaugino. On the other hand, our results should have little effect on calculations of the cosmological abundance of neutralinos. We also briefly discuss implications for cosmic-ray antiprotons from neutralino annihilation in the galactic halo. "
"The problems that are connected with Lagrangians which depend on higher order derivatives (namely additional degrees of freedom, unbound energy from below, etc.) are absent if effective Lagrangians are considered because the equations of motion may be used to eliminate all higher order time derivatives from the effective interaction term. The application of the equations of motion can be realized by performing field transformations that involve derivatives of the fields. Using the Hamiltonian formalism for higher order Lagrangians (Ostrogradsky formalism), Lagrangians that are related by such transformations are shown to be physically equivalent (at the classical and at the quantum level). The equivalence of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian path integral quantization (Matthews's theorem) is proven for effective higher order Lagrangians. Effective interactions of massive vector fields involving higher order derivatives are examined within gauge noninvariant models as well as within (linearly or nonlinearly realized) spontaneously broken gauge theories. The Stueckelberg formalism, which relates gauge noninvariant to gauge invariant Lagrangians, becomes reformulated within the Ostrogradsky formalism. "
Explicit expressions for the generators of the quantum superalgebra $U_q[gl(n/m)]$ acting on a class of irreducible representations are given. The class under consideration consists of all essentially typical representations: for these a Gel'fand-Zetlin basis is known. The verification of the quantum superalgebra relations to be satisfied is shown to reduce to a set of $q$-number identities. 
"We prove two stability results for the scale invariant solutions of the nonlinear heat equation $\partial_t u=\Delta u - |u|^{p-1}u$ with $1<p<1+{2\over n}$, $n$ being the spatial dimension. The first result is that a small perturbation of a scale invariant solution vanishes as $t\rightarrow\infty$. The second result is global, with a positivity condition on the initial data. "
"By using the long-wave approximation, a system of coupled evolution equations for the bulk velocity and the surface perturbations of a B\'enard-Marangoni system is obtained. It includes nonlinearity, dispersion and dissipation, and it can be interpreted as a dissipative generalization of the usual Boussinesq system of equations. As a particular case, a strictly dissipative version of the Boussinesq system is obtained. Finnaly, some speculations are made on the nature of the physical phenomena described by this system of equations. "
"We describe the results of analytic calculations and computer simulations of adaptive predictors (predictive agents) responding to an evolving chaotic environment and to one another. Our simulations are designed to quantify adaptation and to explore co-adaptation for a simple calculable model of a complex adaptive system. We first consider the ability of a single agent, exposed to a chaotic environment, to model, control, and predict the future states of that environment. We then introduce a second agent which, in attempting to model and control both the chaotic environment and the first agent, modifies the extent to which that agent can identify patterns and exercise control. We find that (i) optimal adaptive predictors have an optimal memory and an optimal complexity, which are small for a rapidly changing map dynamics and (ii) that the predictive power can be increased by imposing chaos or random noise onto the map dynamics. The competition between the two predictive agents can lead either to chaos, or to metastable emergent behavior, best described as a leader-follower relationship. Our results suggest a correlation between optimal adaptation, optimal complexity, and emergent behavior, and provide preliminary support for the concept of optimal co-adaptation near the edge of chaos. "
"The $NN$ scattering near inelastic threshold is sensitive to the long-range diagonal interaction in the produced isobar channel. Earlier models included meson exchange potentials in the $NN$ sector and connecting that sector to isobar channels, as well as an $R$-matrix description of short-range quark effects. Including the diagonal pion exchange contributions in the $N\Delta$ channels coupled to the very inelastic ${}^1D_2$ and ${}^3F_3$ $NN$ channels substantially improves those phase parameters and the observables $\Delta\sigma_{L}$ and $\Delta\sigma_{T}$. The same improvement is made to the other $I=1$ $NN$ channels. In the ${}^1S_0$ $NN$ channel coupling to the $\Delta\Delta$ channel is unusually important due to the $L=2$ angular momentum barrier in the $N\Delta$ channel. The pion exchange transition potentials between isobar channels are included in this partial wave to obtain the correct equilibrium between one- and two-pion decay channels. Other improvements to earlier models have been made, in the specification of isobar channels and the inclusion of decay width effects in more channels. A comparison is made with all the $pp$ data for $T_L \le 800$~MeV, producing a very good fit over the whole energy range. "
"We present a string-inspired/derived supergravity model based on the flipped $SU(5)\times U(1)$ structure supplemented by a minimal set of additional matter representations such that unification occurs at the string scale ($\sim10^{18}\GeV$). This model is complemented by two string supersymmetry breaking scenaria: the $SU(N,1)$ no-scale supergravity model and a dilaton-induced supersymmetry breaking scenario. Both imply universal soft supersymmetry breaking parameters: $m_0=0, A=0$ and $m_0=\coeff{1}{\sqrt{3}}m_{1/2}, A=-m_{1/2}$ respectively. In either case the models depend on only three parameters: $m_t$, $\tan\beta$, and $m_{\tilde g}$. We present a comparative study of the sparticle and Higgs spectra of both models and conclude that even though both can be partially probed at the Tevatron, LEPII, and HERA, a larger fraction of the parameter space of the no-scale model is actually accessible. In both cases there is a more constrained version which allows to determine $\tan\beta$ in terms of $m_t,m_{\tilde g}$. In the strict no-scale case we find that the value of $m_t$ determines the sign of $\mu$ ($\mu>0:\,m_t\lsim135\GeV$, $\mu<0:\,m_t\gsim140\GeV$) and whether the lightest Higgs boson mass is above or below $100\GeV$. In the more constrained version of the dilaton scenario, $\tan\beta\approx1.4-1.6$ and $m_t\lsim155\GeV$, $61\GeV\lsim m_h\lsim91\GeV$ follow. Thus, continuing Tevatron top-quark searches and LEPI,II Higgs searches could probe this restricted scenario completely. "
"We consider chaotic inflation in the theories with the effective potentials phi^n and e^{\alpha\phi}. In such theories inflationary domains containing sufficiently large and homogeneous scalar field \phi permanently produce new inflationary domains of a similar type. We show that under certain conditions this process of the self-reproduction of the Universe can be described by a stationary distribution of probability, which means that the fraction of the physical volume of the Universe in a state with given properties (with given values of fields, with a given density of matter, etc.) does not depend on time, both at the stage of inflation and after it. This represents a strong deviation of inflationary cosmology from the standard Big Bang paradigm. We compare our approach with other approaches to quantum cosmology, and illustrate some of the general conclusions mentioned above with the results of a computer simulation of stochastic processes in the inflationary Universe. "
"We review recent progress in 2D gravity coupled to $d<1$ conformal matter, based on a representation of discrete gravity in terms of random matrices. We discuss the saddle point approximation for these models, including a class of related $O(n)$ matrix models. For $d<1$ matter, the matrix problem can be completely solved in many cases by the introduction of suitable orthogonal polynomials. Alternatively, in the continuum limit the orthogonal polynomial method can be shown to be equivalent to the construction of representations of the canonical commutation relations in terms of differential operators. In the case of pure gravity or discrete Ising--like matter, the sum over topologies is reduced to the solution of non-linear differential equations (the Painlev\'e equation in the pure gravity case) which can be shown to follow from an action principle. In the case of pure gravity and more generally all unitary models, the perturbation theory is not Borel summable and therefore alone does not define a unique solution. In the non-Borel summable case, the matrix model does not define the sum over topologies beyond perturbation theory. We also review the computation of correlation functions directly in the continuum formulation of matter coupled to 2D gravity, and compare with the matrix model results. Finally, we review the relation between matrix models and topological gravity, and as well the relation to intersection theory of the moduli space of punctured Riemann surfaces. "
"The effective action on an orbifolded sphere is computed for minimally coupled scalar fields. The results are presented in terms of derivatives of Barnes zeta-functions and it is shown how these may be evaluated. Numerical values are shown. An analytical, heat-kernel derivation of the Ces\`aro-Fedorov formula for the number of symmetry planes of a regular solid is also presented. "
"It is shown that an interacting theory, defined on a regular lattice, must have a vector-like spectrum if the following conditions are satisfied: (a)~locality, (b)~relativistic continuum limit without massless bosons, and (c)~pole-free effective vertex functions for conserved currents. The proof exploits the zero frequency inverse retarded propagator of an appropriate set of interpolating fields as an effective quadratic hamiltonian, to which the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem is applied. "
The experimentally predicted existence of a proton halo in $^8$B is confirmed by dynamical microscopic multiconfiguration cluster model calculations. The thickness of the proton halo in $^8$B is 0.5 $fm$ while in $^8$Li a 0.4 $fm$ thick neutron halo has been found. It is shown that the huge quadrupole moment of $^8$B partly comes from the very distortable $^7$Be core. 
"Using the upper bound on the effective number of light neutrino species during primordial nucleosynthesis and the cosmological pion-pole mechanism $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow \pi^0\rightarrow \gamma X$, we obtain an upper limit on the branching ratio for the decay BR$(\pi^0\rightarrow \gamma X)<3\times 10^{-13}$, where $X$ is any long-lived weakly interacting neutral vector particle with mass smaller than the neutral pion mass. "
We will summarize some aspects of the scenario of a strongly interacting symmetry breaking sector via which the longitudinal vector boson scattering becomes strong. We will examine the feasibility of observing such strong $W_L W_L$ signal at the future hadronic supercolliders. 
"We consider certain naturalness questions in supersymmetric theories. Various suggestions which give rise to squark degeneracies are reviewed. A stringy scenario, discussed by Kaplunovsky and Louis, is the only one which leads to complete degeneracy of squarks and sleptons at the high scale. Alternatives include the possible existence of a gauged non-Abelian horizontal symmetry, broken at some scale, and theories in which the ``messengers"" of supersymmetry breaking are gauge interactions. A model of the latter type is described, in which supersymmetry is {\it dynamically} broken at TeV energies. Models of this type can solve many of the naturalness problems of supersymmetric theories, and predict a rich phenomenology at SSC energies. "
"We study a model Hamiltonian for superconductivity in underdamped Josephson junction arrays in the presence of an offset voltage between the array and the substrate. We develop an approximate zero-temperature (T = 0) phase diagram as a function of Josephson coupling, charging energy, and offset voltage, using a simple Hartree-type mean-field approximation. With diagonal charging energy, the calculated phase diagram is periodic in offset voltage, in agreement with previous results. At a special value of this voltage such that states with n and n+1 Cooper pairs per grain are degenerate, only an infinitesimal Josephson coupling is needed to establish long-range phase coherence in this approximation. With both diagonal and nearest-neighbor charging energies, the T = 0 phase diagram has two types of insulating lobes with different kinds of charge order, and two types of superconducting regions. One of these is a ``supersolid'' in which long-range phase coherence coexists with a frozen charge density wave. We briefly discuss connections to previous calculations, and possible relevance to experiments. "
"One of the possible modes suggested for detecting the Higgs particle is $pp\rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow\ell^+\ell^-\nu\bar{\nu}$, where the Higgs appears as a resonance on a Jacobian background. Unfortunately there are QCD background processes which mimic the final state and we are obliged to impose stringent kinematic cuts to remove them. However, in doing so we also remove a significant fraction of the signal. In this report we suggest a method, based on examining the distribution of the final state charged leptons, which could allow us to relax our cuts and thus salvage the signal. "
"We present results of a detailed investigation of the temperature dependence of the spatial string tension in SU(2) gauge theory. We show, for the first time, that the spatial string tension is scaling on the lattice and thus is non-vanishing in the continuum limit. It is temperature independent below Tc and rises rapidly above. For temperatures larger than 2Tc we find a scaling behaviour consistent with sigma_s(T) = 0.136(11) g^4(T) T^2, where g(T) is the 2-loop running coupling constant with a scale parameter determined as Lambda_T = 0.076(13) Tc. "
"We consider a hierarchy of the natural type Hamiltonian systems of $n$ degrees of freedom with polynomial potentials separable in general ellipsoidal and general paraboloidal coordinates. We give a Lax representation in terms of $2\times 2$ matrices for the whole hierarchy and construct the associated linear $r$-matrix algebra with the $r$-matrix dependent on the dynamical variables. A Yang-Baxter equation of dynamical type is proposed. Using the method of variable separation we provide the integration of the systems in classical mechanics conctructing the separation equations and, hence, the explicit form of action variables. The quantisation problem is discussed with the help of the separation variables. "
"Let $\scr A^*=\{l_1,l_2,\cdots,l_n\}$ be a line arrangement in $\Bbb{CP}^2$, i.e., a collection of distinct lines in $\Bbb{CP}^2$. Let $L(\scr A^*)$ be the set of all intersections of elements of $A^*$ partially ordered by $X\leq Y\Leftrightarrow Y\subseteq X$. Let $M(\scr A^*)$ be $\Bbb{CP}^2-\bigcup\scr A^*$ where $\bigcup\scr A^*= \bigcup\{l_i\colon\ 1\leq i\leq n\}$. The central problem of the theory of arrangement of lines in $\Bbb{CP}^2$ is the relationship between $M(\scr A^*)$ and $L(\scr A^*)$. "
"Extended super self-dual systems have a structure reminiscent of a ``matreoshka''. For instance, solutions for N=0 are embedded in solutions for N=1, which are in turn embedded in solutions for N=2, and so on. Consequences of this phenomenon are explored. In particular, we present an explicit construction of local solutions of the higher-N super self-duality equations starting from any N=0 self-dual solution. Our construction uses N=0 solution data to produce N=1 solution data, which in turn yields N=2 solution data, and so on; each stage introducing a dependence of the solution on sufficiently many additional arbitrary functions to yield the most general supersymmetric solution having the initial N=0 solution as the helicity +1 component. The problem of finding the general local solution of the $N>0$ super self-duality equations therefore reduces to finding the general solution of the usual (N=0) self-duality equations. Another consequence of the matreoshka phenomenon is the vanishing of many conserved currents, including the supercurrents, for super self-dual systems. "
"In the last 20 years we have accumulated an enormous amount of data on elementary particles and their interactions. This data serves two purposes: to fix the phenomenological parameters of the Standard Model [SM] and to verify that the SM is an excellent description of nature. It is our goal to understand the origin of these many arbitrary parameters. In this talk we consider a supersymmetric [SUSY] SO(10) grand unified theory [GUT]. We present a straightforward procedure, incorporating a general operator analysis, which allows us to use low energy data to determine the fermionic sector of the theory at the GUT scale. "
"Drawing an analogy with the Dirac theory of fermions interacting with electromagnetic and gravitational field we write down supersymmetric equations of motion and construct a superfield action for particles with spin 1/4 and 3/4 (quartions), where the role of quartion momentum in effective (2+1)--dimensional space-time is played by an abelian gauge superfield propagating in a basic two-dimensional Grassmann-odd space with a cosmological constant showing itself as the quartion mass. So, the (0|2) (0 even and 2 odd) dimensional model of quartions interacting with the gauge and gravitational field manifests itself as an effective (2+1)-dimensional supersymmetric theory of free quartions. "
"For the electromagnetic fields, hydrodynamic media and turbulent flows we consider the relationship between a topological characteristic of vector fields known as helicity and the angular momentum of the medium, and discuss, in this respect, the problem of helicity and angular momentum transfer from the electromagnetic field to a medium. "
"We present a second order gravity action which consists of ordinary Einstein action augmented by a first-order, vector like, Chern-Simons quasi topological term.This theory is ghost-free and propagates a pure spin-2 mode. It is diffeomorphism invariant, although its local Lorentz invariance has been spontaneously broken. "
"Is speculative mathematics dangerous? Recent interactions between physics and mathematics pose the question with some force: traditional mathematical norms discourage speculation, but it is the fabric of theoretical physics. In practice there can be benefits, but there can also be unpleasant and destructive consequences. Serious caution is required, and the issue should be considered before, rather than after, obvious damage occurs. With the hazards carefully in mind, we propose a framework that should allow a healthy and positive role for speculation. "
"We present a supersymmetric grand unification scheme based on the gauge group SU(3)_c X SU(3)_L X SU(3)_R in which the proton and the lightest supersymmetric particle are stable, neutrinos are necessarily massive, and the observed baryon asymmetry originates in the lepton sector. Such models are also consistent with the measured value of sin^2\Theta_W as well as unification of the gauge couplings. "
"We examine extended inflation models enhanced by the addition of a coupling between the inflaton field and the space-time curvature. We examine two types of model, where the underlying inflaton potential takes on second-order and first-order form respectively. One aim is to provide models which satisfy the solar system constraints on the Brans--Dicke parameter $\omega$. This constraint has proven very problematic in previous extended inflation models, and we find circumstances where it can be successfully evaded, though the constraint must be carefully assessed in our model and can be much stronger than the usual $\omega > 500$. In the simplest versions of the model, one may avoid the need to introduce a mass for the Brans--Dicke field in order to ensure that it takes on the correct value at the present epoch, as seems to be required in hyperextended inflation. We also briefly discuss aspects of the formation of topological defects in the inflaton field itself. "
"We find a canonical $N{=}2$ superconformal algebra (SCA) in the BRST complex associated to any affine Lie algebra $\ghhat$ with $\gh$ semisimple. In contrast with the similar known results for the Virasoro, $N{=}1$ supervirasoro, and $\W_3$ algebras, this SCA does not depend on the particular ``matter'' representation chosen. Therefore it follows that every gauged WZNW model with data $(\gg\supset\gh, k)$ has an $N{=}2$ SCA with central charge $c=3\dim\gh$ independent of the level $k$. In particular, this associates to every embedding $sl(2) \subset \gg$ a one-parameter family of $c{=}9$ $N{=}2$ supervirasoro algebras. As a by-product of the construction, one can deduce a new set of ``master equations'' for generalized $N{=}2$ supervirasoro constructions which is simpler than the one considered thus far. "
"We present a simple model for the friction of two solid bodies moving against each other. In a self consistent way we can obtain the dependence of the macroscopic friction force as a function of the driving velocity, the normal force and the ruggedness of the surfaces in contact. Our results are discussed in the context of friction laws used in earthquake models. "
"Fractional superstrings experience new types of ``internal projections'' which alter or deform their underlying worldsheet conformal field theories. In this talk I summarize some recent results concerning both the worldsheet theory which remains after the internal projections have acted, and the spacetime statistics properties of its various sectors. "
"Several aspects of fusion rings and fusion rule algebras, and of their manifestations in twodimensional (conformal) field theory, are described: diagonalization and the connection with modular invariance; the presentation in terms of quotients of polynomial rings; fusion graphs; various strategies that allow for a partial classification; and the role of the fusion rules in the conformal bootstrap programme. "
"We present self-dual spin-3 and 4 actions using relevant dreibein fields. since these actions start with a Chern-Simons like kinetic term (and therefore cannot be obtained through dimensional reduction) one might wonder whether they need the presence of auxiliary ghost-killings fields. It turns out that they must contain, also in this three dimensional case, auxiliary fields. They do not break self-duality: their free actions do not contain kinetic second order terms. "
"We compute the elliptic genera of orbifolds associated with $N=2$ super--conformal theories which admit a Landau-Ginzburg description. The identification of the elliptic genera of the macroscopic Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds with those of the corresponding microscopic $N=2$ orbifolds further supports the conjectured identification of these theories. For $SU(N)$ Kazama-Suzuki models the orbifolds are associated with certain $\IZ_p$ subgroups of the various coset factors. Based on our approach we also conjecture the existence of ""$E$-type"" variants of these theories, their elliptic genera and the corresponding Landau-Ginzburg potentials. "
"A sufficient condition for the confinement of quarks is presented. Quarks are shown to be unobservable. Colour singlets are however, observables. The results of deep inelastic scattering are discussed. We argue that QCD does not exhibit a deconfining transition. "
It is shown that the complete localization of eigenvectors for the almost Mathieu operator entails the absence of Cantor spectrum for this operator. 
"For an oriented link $L \subset S^3 = \Bd\!D^4$, let $\chi_s(L)$ be the greatest Euler characteristic $\chi(F)$ of an oriented 2-manifold $F$ (without closed components) smoothly embedded in $D^4$ with boundary $L$. A knot $K$ is {\it slice} if $\chi_s(K)=1$. Realize $D^4$ in $\C^2$ as $\{(z,w):|z|^2+|w|^2\le1\}$. It has been conjectured that, if $V$ is a nonsingular complex plane curve transverse to $S^3$, then $\chi_s(V\cap S^3)=\chi(V\cap D^4)$. Kronheimer and Mrowka have proved this conjecture in the case that $V\cap D^4$ is the Milnor fiber of a singularity. I explain how this seemingly special case implies both the general case and the ``slice-Bennequin inequality'' for braids. As applications, I show that various knots are not slice (e.g., pretzel knots like $\Pscr(-3,5,7)$; all knots obtained from a positive trefoil $O\{2,3\}$ by iterated untwisted positive doubling). As a sidelight, I give an optimal counterexample to the ``topologically locally-flat Thom conjecture''. "
"RGEs for coefficients of dim-5 operators giving rise to neutrino masses in the seesaw mechanism are written down in the SM, 2HDM and MSSM, and solved numerically. RG evolution of these coefficients modifies tree-level seesaw predictions for neutrino masses and mixing angles in SO(10)-type GUT models as strongly as quark Yukawa coupling evolution. "
The author surveys the problem of piecing together integral or rational solutions to Diophantine equations (global structure) from solutions modulo congruences and real solutions (local structure). 
"In principle, the tensor metric (gravity-wave) perturbations that arise in inflationary models can, beyond probing the underlying inflationary model, provide information about the Universe: ionization history, presence of a cosmological constant, and epoch of matter-radiation equality. Because tensor perturbations give rise to anisotropy of the cosmic background radiation (CBR) solely through the Sachs-Wolfe effect we are able to calculate analytically the variance of the multipole moments of this part of the CBR temperature anisotropy. In so doing, we carefully take account of the contribution of tensor perturbations that entered the Hubble radius during both the matter-dominated and radiation-dominated epoch by means of a transfer function. The striking feature in the spectrum of multipole amplitudes is a dramatic fall off for $l\ga \sqrt{1+\zl}$, where $\zl$ is the red shift of the last-scattering surface. ... "
"There exist two new embedded minimal surfaces, asymptotic to the helicoid. One is periodic, with quotient (by orientation-preserving translations) of genus one. The other is nonperiodic of genus one. "
Let $f(d)$ be the smallest number so that every set in $R^d$ of diameter 1 can be partitioned into $f(d)$ sets of diameter smaller than 1. Borsuk's conjecture was that $f(d)\! =\!d\!+\!1$. We prove that $f(d)\! \ge\! (1.2)^{\sqrt d}$ for large~$d$. 
"We introduce the notion of ortho-symplectic super triple system, and apply it to find solutions of super Yang-Baxter equation. Also, the para-statistics are formulated as a Lie-super triple system. "
"The properties of vortices in Josephson junction arrays are investigated in the quantum regime near the superconductor-insulator transition. We derive and study an effective action for vortex dynamics that is valid in the region where the charging energy is comparable to the Josephson coupling energy. In the superconducting phase the onset of quantum effects reduces the vortex mass and depinning current. In the case of long range Coulomb interaction between Cooper pairs we find that as the transition is approached, the velocity window in which ballistic vortex motion is possible grows. At the superconductor-insulator transition the vortex mass vanishes and vortices and spinwaves decouple. In the case of on-site Coulomb repulsion (which is of relevance for superconducting granular films) the vortex mass it is sample-size dependent in the superconducting phase, but stays finite at the critical point where it is scale invariant. The relation of our work to experiment is discussed. "
"We discuss the functional Schroedinger picture for fermions in external fields for both stationary and time-dependent problems. We give formal results for the ground state and the solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation for QED in arbitrary dimensions, while more explicit results are obtained in two dimensions. For both the massless and massive Schwinger model we give an explicit expression for the ground state functional as well as for the expectation values of energy, electric and axial charge. We also give the corresponding results for non-abelian fields. We solve the functional Schroedinger equation for a constant external field in four dimensions and obtain the amount of particle creation. We solve the Schroedinger equation for arbitrary external fields for massless QED in two dimensions and make a careful discussionof the anomalous particle creation rate. Finally, we discuss some subtleties connected with the interpretation of the quantized Gauss constraint. "
"A viable and still unproved conjecture states that, if $X$ is a smooth algebraic surface and $C$ is a smooth algebraic curve in $X$, then $C$ realizes the smallest possible genus amongst all smoothly embedded $2$-manifolds in its homology class. A proof is announced here for this conjecture, for a large class of surfaces $X$, under the assumption that the normal bundle of $C$ has positive degree. "
"The solution $u(t,x,y)$ of the Kadomtsev--Petviashvili I (KPI) equation with given initial data $u(0,x,y)$ belonging to the Schwartz space is considered. No additional special constraints, usually considered in literature, as $\int\!dx\,u(0,x,y)=0$ are required to be satisfied by the initial data. The problem is completely solved in the framework of the spectral transform theory and it is shown that $u(t,x,y)$ satisfies a special evolution version of the KPI equation and that, in general, $\partial_t u(t,x,y)$ has different left and right limits at the initial time $t=0$. The conditions of the type $\int\!dx\,u(t,x,y)=0$, $\int\!dx\,xu_y(t,x,y)=0$ and so on (first, second, etc. `constraints') are dynamically generated by the evolution equation for $t\not=0$. On the other side $\int\!dx\!\!\int\!dy\,u(t,x,y)$ with prescribed order of integrations is not necessarily equal to zero and gives a nontrivial integral of motion. "
"A scenario for the generation of the baryon asymmetry in the early Universe is proposed in which cosmic string loops, predicted by theories where the baryon and/or lepton numbers are gauged symmetries, collapse during the friction dominated period of string evolution. This provides a mechanism for the departure from thermal equilibrium necessary to have a nonvanishing baryon asymmetry. Examples of models are given where this idea can be implemented. In particular, the model with the gauge symmetry $SU(3)_{c}\otimes SU(2)_{L}\otimes U(1)_{Y}\otimes U(1)_{B} \otimes U(1)_{L}$ has the interesting feature where sphaleron processes do not violate the baryon and lepton numbers so that no wash out of any initial baryon asymmetry occurs at the electroweak scale. "
"We study the average case complexity of a linear multivariate problem $(\lmp)$ defined on functions of $d$ variables. We consider two classes of information. The first $\lstd$ consists of function values and the second $\lall$ of all continuous linear functionals. Tractability of $\lmp$ means that the average case complexity is $O((1/\e)^p)$ with $p$ independent of $d$. We prove that tractability of an $\lmp$ in $\lstd$ is equivalent to tractability in $\lall$, although the proof is {\it not} constructive. We provide a simple condition to check tractability in $\lall$. We also address the optimal design problem for an $\lmp$ by using a relation to the worst case setting. We find the order of the average case complexity and optimal sample points for multivariate function approximation. The theoretical results are illustrated for the folded Wiener sheet measure. "
"We study the hydrodynamics of the A-B interface with finite curvature. The interface tension is shown to enhance both the transition velocity and the amplitudes of second sound. In addition, the magnetic signals emitted by the growing bubble are calculated, and the interaction between many growing bubbles is considered. "
An example is constructed of a local ring and a module of finite type and finite projective dimension over that ring such that the module is not rigid. This shows that the rigidity conjecture is false. 
"Parity-violating (pv) effects in inclusive hadron and jet productions in high energy hadron-hadron collisions are analyzed. Such effects arise from the interference between strong and weak amplitudes. This interference gives rise to a nonzero value of the pv parameters $A_L$ and $P_L$, where $A_L$ measures the difference in the inclusive cross sections of, for example, $p+p\ri {\rm jet}+X$ ($X$=anything), with one of incident proton beams in a state of $\pm$ helicity, and $P_L$ denotes the longitudinal polarization of a high-energy baryon (e.g., $\Lambda$) produced in $p+p\ri\Lambda+X$ with the initial proton beams unpolarized. In the present paper, the single helicity asymmetry $A_L$ in one-jet, two-jet and two-jet plus photon productions as well as in the Drell-Yan process $p+p\ri\ell^+\ell^-+{\rm jet}+X$ is probed, and the longitudinal polarization $P_L$ of the $\Lambda$ produced in unpolarized $pp$ collisions is studied. We conclude that the pv effects in high energy proton-proton collisions are in general only sensitive to the spin dependent valence quark distributions. "
"Usually inflation ends either by a slow rolling of the inflaton field, which gradually becomes faster and faster, or by a first-order phase transition. We describe a model where inflation ends in a different way, due to a very rapid rolling (`waterfall') of a scalar field $\sigma$ triggered by another scalar field $\phi$. This model looks as a hybrid of chaotic inflation and the usual theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Another hybrid model to be discussed here uses some building blocks from extended inflation (Brans-Dicke theory), from new inflation (phase transition due to a non-minimal coupling of the inflaton field to gravity) and from chaotic inflation (the possibility of inflation beginning at large as well as at small $\sigma$). In the simplest version of this scenario inflation ends up by slow rolling, thus avoiding the big-bubble problem of extended inflation. "
"I review the main properties of four-dimensional strings constructed with free-fermions on the world-sheet. In particular I discuss possible model independent low energy predictions related to the existence of states with fractional electric charges, the computation of the string unification scale, the string model building, and the perturbative approach to supersymmetry breaking which makes the spectacular prediction of a new large dimension at the TeV scale. "
"We deal with the black hole information loss paradox by showing that the stimulated emission component of the black hole radiation contains information about the initial state of the system. The nonlocal behaviour that allows the recovery of information about the matter that falls behind the horizon appears in a natural way. We calculate the expectation value and probability distribution of particles at ${\cal J}^+$ for a non-vacuum initial state. The entropy of the final state is compared to that of a thermal state with the same energy per mode. We find that the information recovered about the initial state increases with the number $r$ of the initially incoming particles, reaching for example over 30\% for $r = 1000$. We point out that recovering information about the initial state, nevertheless, does not automatically imply the purity of the final state. "
We investigate the possibility to search for supersymmetry in the scattering of protons and Compton back-scattered laser light. We evaluate the cross sections for inelastic and elastic production of wino pairs for different electron-proton c.m.s. energies. For $\sqrt{s}=1\ TeV$ the cross section exceeds $1\ fb$ for $m_w<190\ GeV$. 
"We extend the bosonization of $2+1$ - dimensional QED with one fermionic flavor performed previously to the case of QED with an induced Chern - Simons term. The coefficient of this term is quantized: $e^2n/8\pi$, $n\in {\bf Z}$. The fermion operators are constructed in terms of the bosonic fields $A_i$ and $E_i$. The construction is similar to that in the $n=0$ case. The resulting bosonic theory is Lorentz invariant in the continuum limit and has Maxwell's equations as its equations of motion. The algebra of bilinears exhibits nontrivial operatorial mixing with lower dimensional operators, which is absent for $n=0$. "
"A new and very general technique for simulating solid-fluid suspensions is described; its most important feature is that the computational cost scales linearly with the number of particles. The method combines Newtonian dynamics of the solid particles with a discretized Boltzmann equation for the fluid phase; the many-body hydrodynamic interactions are fully accounted for, both in the creeping-flow regime and at higher Reynolds numbers. Brownian motion of the solid particles arises spontaneously from stochastic fluctuations in the fluid stress tensor, rather than from random forces or displacements applied directly to the particles. In this paper, the theoretical foundations of the technique are laid out, illustrated by simple analytical and numerical examples; in the companion paper, extensive numerical tests of the method, for stationary flows, time-dependent flows, and finite Reynolds number flows, are reported. "
"By providing a suitable definition of the electromagnetic field off the Higgs vacuum, we show that within the sphaleron there is a monopole-antimonopole pair with quantized charges, and a loop of electromagnetic current. On integration of the relevant charges and currents over the interior in the limit of small $\Theta_W$, we recover the standard formula for the sphaleron dipole moment. "
"String theory implies a relatively modest growth in computational complexity for perturbative gravity calculations as compared to gauge theory calculations, contrary to field theory expectations. An explicit string-based calculation, which would be extremely difficult using conventional techniques, is presented to illustrate this. "
"An effective Lagrangian for the technidilaton and its interactions with matter is constructed. Properties of the technidilaton are compared with those of the Higgs boson. Technidilaton decays and production channels are investigated. Main technidilaton decays are suppressed compared to the Higgs boson and the most important production mechanism is due to gluon fusion. Prospects for technidilaton production and detection at $e^+e^-$ colliders and the SSC are examined. LEP 1, LEP 2 and SSC can find or rule out a technidilaton with a mass up to $10~GeV$, $40~GeV$ and $230~GeV$ respectively. "
"The expected large mass $m_t$ of the top quark provides for the first time a chance to discuss the bound-states of the corresponding quantum system as the nonabelian generalization of positronium, using the full power of relativistic quantum field theoretic methods which are available for weakly bound systems. Thus our approach differs in principle from the one used in the vast phenomenological literature on quarkonium potentials. We emphasize especially the corrections of energy levels which are of order $\a^4 m_t$ or numerically comparable to that order, and which have no counterpart in the 'relativistic' corrections of QED. In contrast to previous computations we give analytic expressions for all contributions considered in our present work, hopefully preparing the ground for further similar calculations. "
"We describe a next-to-leading-order calculation of the fully exclusive parton cross section for the photoproduction of heavy quarks. We use our result to compute quantities of interest for current fixed-target experiments. We discuss heavy-quark total cross sections, distributions and correlations. "
"We present analyses of the two-point correlation function derived from an all-sky redshift survey of 5313 galaxies extracted from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) database. The redshift space correlation function \xi(s) is well described by a power law, $\xi(s) = (s/4.53h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^{-1.28}$, on scales \simlt 20\mpc; on larger scales \xi(s) drops below the extension of this power law. We examine the effect of redshift space distortions on the correlation function and compute the full two dimensional correlation function \xi(r_p,\pi). From this, we derive the real space correlation function, which is well described by $\xi(r) = (r/3.76h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^{-1.66}$ on scales \simlt 20\mpc. The derived correlation functions are found to be consistent with previous determinations in the literature, and seem to show more power on large scales than predicted by the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. Comparison of the derived \xi(r) with the correlation function of optical galaxies implies an optical to IRAS bias ratio of $b_O/b_I = 1.38\pm 0.12$ on a scale of $\sim 8$\mpc . The variances in cubical cells inferred from \xi(s) appear discrepant with the previously reported results of Efstathiou et al. (1990). "
"We present a detailed discussion of the elastic scattering of a supersymmetric neutralino off a nucleon or nucleus, with emphasis on the spin--independent interaction. We carefully treat QCD effects on the squark exchange contribution. In particular, we identify a class of terms that survive even in the absence of mixing in both the neutralino and squark sectors; the corresponding quark and gluon operators also appear in analyses of deep--inelastic lepton--nucleon scattering (``twist--2 operators''), so their hadronic matrix elements are well known. We also re--emphasize the importance of mixing between the superpartners of left-- and right--handed quarks, and of the contribution from the heavier scalar Higgs boson. We use our refined calculation of the scattering amplitude to update predictions of signal rates for cosmic relic neutralino searches with Germanium detectors. In general the counting rate varies strongly with the values (even the signs) of model parameters; typical results lie between a few times $10^{-4}$ and a few times $10^{-1}$ events/(kg$\cdot$day). "
We study numerically the out of equilibrium dynamics of the hypercubic cell spin glass in high dimensionalities. We obtain evidence of aging effects qualitatively similar both to experiments and to simulations of low dimensional models. This suggests that the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model as well as other mean-field finite connectivity lattices can be used to study these effects analytically. 
"In the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM) all Higgs self-coupling parameters are related to gauge couplings at tree-level. Leading-logarithmic radiative corrections to these quantities can be summed using renormalization group techniques. By this procedure we obtain complete leading-log radiative corrections to the Higgs masses, the CP-even Higgs mixing angle, and trilinear Higgs couplings. Additional corrections due to squark mixing can be explicitly incorporated into this formalism. These results incorporate nearly all potentially large corrections. Mass shifts to the neutral CP-even Higgs bosons grow with the fourth power of the top-quark mass and can be significant. The phenomenological consequences of these results are examined. "
"Motivated by the possibility of an effective string description for the infrared limit of pure Yang-Mills theory, we present a toy model for an effective theory of random surfaces propagating in a target space of $D>2$. We show that the scaling exponents for the fixed area partition function of the theory are apparently well behaved. We make some observations regarding the usefulness of this toy model. "
"Exact diagonalizations with a minimally modified realistic force lead to detailed agreement with measured level schemes and electromagnetic transitions in $^{48}$Ca, $^{48}$Sc, $^{48}$Ti, $^{48}$V, $^{48}$Cr and $^{48}$Mn. Gamow-Teller strength functions are systematically calculated and reproduce the data to within the standard quenching factor. Their fine structure indicates that fragmentation makes much strength unobservable. As a by-product, the calculations suggest a microscopic description of the onset of rotational motion. The spectroscopic quality of the results provides strong arguments in favour of the general validity of monopole corrected realistic forces, which is discussed. "
"A new and very general technique for simulating solid-fluid suspensions has been described in a previous paper (Part I); the most important feature of the new method is that the computational cost scales with the number of particles. In this paper (Part II), extensive numerical tests of the method are described; for creeping flows, both with and without Brownian motion, and at finite Reynolds numbers. Hydrodynamic interactions, transport coefficients, and the short-time dynamics of random dispersions of up to 1024 colloidal particles have been simulated. "
"We present a calculation of jet activity associated with pair production of top quarks at hadron colliders and supercolliders. Our approach is based upon a merger of $2\rightarrow 3$ matrix elements with initial and final state parton showers. We tabulate expected multi-jet rates in $t\bar t$ events, and compare with ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3 )$ matrix element results and parton showers based upon $2\rightarrow 2$ subprocesses. The merged calculation includes the correct matrix element for the first leg of the parton shower, but also includes the effects of approximate all-orders quark and gluon emission. We also evaluate expected jet activity in top pair events at hadron supercolliders; in particular, a comparison of the jet activity in the far forward region is made. It is found that the merged calculation yields more jet activity in the forward region than pure matrix element estimates, but also more jet activity in the central region. This can be important for background calculations to $H\rightarrow WW$ and strong $WW$ scattering processes. "
"A model predicting the structure of repulsive, spherically symmetric, monodisperse particles confined between two walls is presented. We study the buckling transition of a single flat layer as the double layer state develops. Experimental realizations of this model are suspensions of stabilized colloidal particles squeezed between glass plates. By expanding the thermodynamic potential about a flat state of \( N \) confined colloidal particles, we derive a free energy as a functional of in-plane and out-of-plane displacements. The wavevectors of these first buckling instabilities correspond to three different ordered structures. Landau theory predicts that the symmetry of these phases allows for second order phase transitions. This possibility exists even in the presence of gravity or plate asymmetry. These transitions lead to critical behavior and phases with the symmetry of the three-state and four-state Potts models, the X-Y model with 6-fold anisotropy, and the Heisenberg model with cubic interactions. Experimental detection of these structures is discussed. "
"We analyze the evolution of scalar and gauge fields during first order phase transitions and show how the Kibble mechanism for the formation of topological defects emerges from the underlying dynamics, paying particular attention to problems posed by gauge invariance when a local symmetry is spontaneously broken. We discuss also the application of the mechanism to semilocal defects and electroweak strings. "
"We consider the standard model in the formulationo of non-commutative geometry, for a Euclidean space-time consisting of two copies. The electroweak scale is set by the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field and is undetermined at the classical level. By adding the Coleman-Weinberg effective potential, that scale turns out to be fixed. Provided that the renormalized form of the Lagrangian maintains the vanishing of the cosmological constant, we show that the only solutions for the minimization equations of the total potential occur in the narrow band $146.2 \le m_t \le 147.4 $ Gev for the top quark mass, with the corresponding Higgs mass $117.3 \le m_H\le 142.6$ Gev. "
"The quantum mechanics of a system of charged particles interacting with a magnetic field on Riemann surfaces is studied. We explicitly construct the wave functions of ground states in the case of a metric proportional to the Chern form of the $\theta$-bundle, and the wave functions of the Landau levels in the case of the the Poincar{\' e} metric. The degeneracy of the the Landau levels is obtained by using the Riemann-Roch theorem. Then we construct the Laughlin wave function on Riemann surfaces and discuss the mathematical structure hidden in the Laughlin wave function. Moreover the degeneracy of the Laughlin states is also discussed. "
"Using the previous obtained universal $R$-matrix for the quantized nontwisted affine Lie algebras $U_q(A_1^{(1)})$ and $U_q(A_2^{(1)})$, we determine the explicitly spectral-dependent universal $R$-matrix for the corresponding quantum Lie algebras $U_q(A_1)$ and $U_q(A_2)$. As their applications, we reproduce the well-known results in the fundamental representations and we also derive an extreamly explicit formula of the spectral-dependent $R$-matrix for the adjoint representation of $U_q(A_2)$, the simplest non-trival case when the tensor product decomposition of the representation with itself has finite multiplicity. "
"Calculations have been performed for the $^{16}$O($\gamma$,pn) and the $^{16}$O($\gamma$,pp) reaction in the photon-energy range $E_{\gamma}$ = 60-300 MeV. Besides the contribution from the more common photoabsorption on the pionic degrees of freedom, we have investigated the influence of heavier meson exchange ($\rho, \sigma, \omega$) and intermediate $\Delta$ creation with $\pi$ and $\rho$ exchange. Whereas the $\pi$ meson is found to set the main trends, the $\rho$ meson is found not to be discardable in a theoretical description of the ($\gamma$,pn) reaction. The incorporation of an energy dependence and a decay width in the $\Delta$ propagator is observed to be essential in order to arrive at a more realistic description of ($\gamma$,NN) reactions at higher photon energies. "
"Using a left-right symmetric model with Spontaneous CP Violation and the hypothesis of a weakly first order electroweak phase transition we derive a relation between the produced baryon asymmetry and the observed parameter $\varepsilon$, describing CP violation in the $K$ system. "
"We bosonize a Fermi liquid in any number of dimensions in the limit of long wavelengths. From the bosons we construct a set of coherent states which are related with the displacement of the Fermi surface due to particle-hole excitations. We show that an interacting hamiltonian in terms of the original fermions is quadratic in the bosons. We obtain a path integral representation for the generating functional which in real time, in the semiclassical limit, gives the Landau equation for sound waves and in the imaginary time gives us the correct form of the specific heat for a Fermi liquid even with the corrections due to the interactions between the fermions. We also discuss the similarities between our results and the physics of quantum crystals. "
"The requirements of conformal invariance for two and three point functions for general dimension $d$ on flat space are investigated. A compact group theoretic construction of the three point function for arbitrary spin fields is presented and it is applied to various cases involving conserved vector operators and the energy momentum tensor. The restrictions arising from the associated conservation equations are investigated. It is shown that there are, for general $d$, three linearly independent conformal invariant forms for the three point function of the energy momentum tensor, although for $d=3$ there are two and for $d=2$ only one. The form of the three point function is also demonstrated to simplify considerably when all three points lie on a straight line. Using this the coefficients of the conformal invariant point functions are calculated for free scalar and fermion theories in general dimensions and for abelian vector fields when $d=4$. Ward identities relating three and two point functions are also discussed. This requires careful analysis of the singularities in the short distance expansion and the method of differential regularisation is found convenient. For $d=4$ the coefficients appearing in the energy momentum tensor three point function are related to the coefficients of the two possible terms in the trace anomaly for a conformal theory on a curved space background. "
"In the first paper in this series we presented a typical set of galactic rotation curves associated with the conformal invariant fourth order theory of gravity which has recently been advanced by Mannheim and Kazanas as a candidate alternative to the standard second order Einstein theory. Reasonable agreement with data was obtained for four representative galaxies without the need for any non-luminous or dark matter. In this second paper we present the associated formalism. Additionally, we discuss the status of the Tully-Fisher relation in our theory, compare and contrast our theory with the dark matter theory, and make some general observations regarding the systematics of galactic rotation curve data. "
"In this paper the Galilean, scaling and translational self--similarity conditions for the AKNS hierarchy are analysed geometrically in terms of the infinite dimensional Grassmannian. The string equations found recently by non--scaling limit analysis of the one--matrix model are shown to correspond to the Galilean self--similarity condition for this hierarchy. We describe, in terms of the initial data for the zero--curvature 1--form of the AKNS hierarchy, the moduli space of these self--similar solutions in the Sato Grassmannian. As a byproduct we characterize the points in the Segal--Wilson Grassmannian corresponding to the Sachs rational solutions of the AKNS equation and to the Nakamura--Hirota rational solutions of the NLS equation. An explicit 1--parameter family of Galilean self--similar solutions of the AKNS equation and the associated solution to the NLS equation is determined. "
"We consider pure glue QCD at beta=5.7, beta=6.0 and beta=6.3. We evaluate the gluon propagator both in time at zero 3-momentum and in momentum space. From the former quantity we obtain evidence for a dynamically generated effective mass, which at beta=6.0 and beta=6.3 increases with the time separation of the sources, in agreement with earlier results. The momentum space propagator G(k) provides further evidence for mass generation. In particular, at beta=6.0, for k less than 1 GeV, the propagator G(k) can be fit to a continuum formula proposed by Gribov and others, which contains a mass scale b, presumably related to the hadronization mass scale. For higher momenta Gribov's model no longer provides a good fit, as G(k) tends rather to follow an inverse power law. The results at beta=6.3 are consistent with those at beta=6.0, but only the high momentum region is accessible on this lattice. We find b in the range of three to four hundred MeV and the exponent of the inverse power law about 2.7. On the other hand, at beta=5.7 (where we can only study momenta up to 1 GeV) G(k) is best fit to a simple massive boson propagator with mass m. We argue that such a discrepancy may be related to a lack of scaling for low momenta at beta=5.7. {}From our results, the study of correlation functions in momentum space looks promising, especially because the data points in Fourier space turn out to be much less correlated than in real space. "
"We review recent work on the strong CP problem in the context of realistic string-inspired models. We discuss the various solutions, review the conjecture that CP is generally a gauged discrete symmetry in string theory and then consider models of the Nelson-Barr type. We note that squark non-degeneracy spoils the Nelson-Barr structure at the one loop level. We stress that string theory expectations, as well as naturalness arguments, make it very difficult to avoid the constraints on non-degeneracy. "
"The Flory theory for a single polymer chain is derived as the lowest order of a cumulant expansion. In this approach, the full original Flory free energy (including the logarithmic term), is recovered. %This term does not change the wandering exponent $ \nu $ but turns out to %be responsible for the crossover from Brownian $ (d>4) $ to swollen $ %(d\leq4) $ %regime. The prefactors of the elastic and repulsive energy are calculated from the microscopic parameters. The method can be applied to other types of monomer-monomer interactions, and the case of a single chain in a bad solvent is discussed . The method is easily generalized to many chain systems (polymers in solutions), yielding the usual crossovers with chain concentration. Finally, this method is suitable for a systematic expansion around the Flory theory. The corrections to Flory theory consist of extensive terms (proportional to the number $N$ of monomers) and powers of $N^{2-\nu d}$ . These last terms diverge in the thermodynamic limit, but less rapidly than the usual Fixman expansion in $N^{2- d/2}$. "
"Developing on the ideas of R. Stora and coworkers, a formulation of two dimensional field theory endowed with extended conformal symmetry is given, which is based on deformation theory of holomorphic and Hermitian spaces. The geometric background consists of a vector bundle $E$ over a closed surface $\Sigma$ endowed with a holomorphic structure and a Hermitian structure subordinated to it. The symmetry group is the semidirect product of the automorphism group ${\rm Aut}(E)$ of $E$ and the extended Weyl group ${\rm Weyl}(E)$ of $E$ and acts on the holomorphic and Hermitian structures. The extended Weyl anomaly can be shifted into an automorphism chirally split anomaly by adding to the action a local counterterm, as in ordinary conformal field theory. The dependence on the scale of the metric on the fiber of $E$ is encoded in the Donaldson action, a vector bundle generalization of the Liouville action. The Weyl and automorphism anomaly split into two contributions corresponding respectively to the determinant and projectivization of $E$. The determinant part induces an effective ordinary Weyl or diffeomorphism anomaly and the induced central charge can be computed. "
"The influence of short-range correlations on the $p$-wave single-particle spectral function in $^{16}{\rm O}$ is studied as a function of energy. This influence, which is represented by the admixture of high-momentum components, is found to be small in the $p$-shell quasihole wave functions. It is therefore unlikely that studies of quasihole momentum distributions using the $(e,e'p)$ reaction will reveal a significant contribution of high momentum components. Instead, high-momentum components become increasingly more dominant at higher excitation energy. The above observations are consistent with the energy distribution of high-momentum components in nuclear matter. "
"Dynamical zeta functions are expected to relate the Schr\""odinger operator's spectrum to the periodic orbits of the corresponding fully chaotic Hamiltonian system. The relationsship is exact in the case of surfaces of constant negative curvature. The recently found factorisation of the Selberg zeta function for the modular surface is known to correspond to a decomposition of the Schr\""odinger operator's eigenfunctions into two sets obeying different boundary condition on Artin's billiard. Here we express zeta functions for Artin's billiard in terms of generalized transfer operators, providing thereby a new dynamical proof of the above interpretation of the factorization formula. This dynamical proof is then extended to the Artin--Venkov--Zograf formula for finite coverings of the modular surface. "
"We study a regularization of the Pauli-Villars kind of the one loop gravitational divergences in any dimension. The Pauli-Villars fields are massive particles coupled to gravity in a covariant and nonminimal way, namely one real tensor and one complex vector. The gauge is fixed by means of the unusual gauge-fixing that gives the same effective action as in the context of the background field method. Indeed, with the background field method it is simple to see that the regularization effectively works. On the other hand, we show that in the usual formalism (non background) the regularization cannot work with each gauge-fixing.In particular, it does not work with the usual one. Moreover, we show that, under a suitable choice of the Pauli-Villars coefficients, the terms divergent in the Pauli-Villars masses can be corrected by the Pauli-Villars fields themselves. In dimension four, there is no need to add counterterms quadratic in the curvature tensor to the Einstein action (which would be equivalent to the introduction of new coupling constants). The technique also works when matter is coupled to gravity. We discuss the possible consequences of this approach, in particular the renormalization of Newton's coupling constant and the appearance of two parameters in the effective action, that seem to have physical implications.

"Using (1,0) superfield methods, we determine the general scalar potential consistent with off-shell (p,0) supersymmetry and (1,1) supersymmetry in two-dimensional non-linear sigma models with torsion. We also present an extended superfield formulation of the (p,0) models and show how the (1,1) models can be obtained from the (1,1)-superspace formulation of the gauged, but massless, (1,1) sigma model.

"Tree amplitudes of the production of two kinds of scalar particles at threshold from one virtual particle are calculated in a model of two scalar fields with $O(2)$ symmetric quartic interaction and unequal masses. These amplitudes exhibit interesting factorial and exponential behaviour at large multiplicities. As a by-product we observe that the kinematically allowed decay of one real particle into $n$ real particles of another kind, all at rest, has zero tree amplitude in this model for $n>2$. "
"I review the status of CP violating phenomena and CPT tests in the neutral Kaon system. Comparisons of present data with the expectations of the Cabibbo Kobayashi Maskawa model are presented, with particular emphasis being focused on the role of the theoretical uncertainties in this comparison. In addition, novel tests of CPT at DAFNE and Fermilab are briefly discussed. "
"The thermalization rate for long wavelength fluctuations in the Higgs field is calculated from the imaginary part of the finite temperature effective action in the unbroken phase of the Standard Model. We use improved propagators including a resummation of hard thermal loops. The thermalization rate is computed at one loop level, but an estimate of the two--loop contribution appears to give an indication that they are comparable to the one--loop result for small thermal higgs mass. We show also that the Higgs field fluctuations are likely to thermalize very fast compared with the electroweak phase transition time. "
"We propose a novel mechanism for the origin of non-Gaussian tails in the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of local variables in nonlinear, diffusive, dynamical systems including passive scalars advected by chaotic velocity fields. Intermittent fluctuations on appropriate time scales in the amplitude of the (chaotic) noise can lead to exponential tails. We provide numerical evidence for such behavior in deterministic, discrete-time passive scalar models. Different possibilities for PDFs are also outlined. "
"This paper is an extended version of our previous short letter \cite{ZG2} and is attempted to give a detailed account for the results presented in that paper. Let $U_q({\cal G}^{(1)})$ be the quantized nontwisted affine Lie algebra and $U_q({\cal G})$ be the corresponding quantum simple Lie algebra. Using the previous obtained universal $R$-matrix for $U_q(A_1^{(1)})$ and $U_q(A_2^{(1)})$, we determine the explicitly spectral-dependent universal $R$-matrix for $U_q(A_1)$ and $U_q(A_2)$. We apply these spectral-dependent universal $R$-matrix to some concrete representations. We then reproduce the well-known results for the fundamental representations and we are also able to derive for the first time the extreamly explicit and compact formula of the spectral-dependent $R$-matrix for the adjoint representation of $U_q(A_2)$, the simplest nontrival case when the tensor product of the representations is {\em not} multiplicity-free. "
"The periodic flag manifold (in the Sato Grassmannian context) description of the modified Korteweg--de Vries hierarchy is used to analyse the translational and scaling self--similar solutions of this hierarchy. These solutions are characterized by the string equations appearing in the double scaling limit of the symmetric unitary matrix model with boundary terms. The moduli space is a double covering of the moduli space in the Sato Grassmannian for the corresponding self--similar solutions of the Korteweg--de Vries hierarchy, i.e. of stable 2D quantum gravity. The potential modified Korteweg--de Vries hierarchy, which can be described in terms of a line bundle over the periodic flag manifold, and its self--similar solutions corresponds to the symmetric unitary matrix model. Now, the moduli space is in one--to--one correspondence with a subset of codimension one of the moduli space in the Sato Grassmannian corresponding to self--similar solutions of the Korteweg--de Vries hierarchy.

"Realistic quantum mechanics based on complex probability theory is shown to have a frequency interpretation, to coexist with Bell's theorem, to be linear, to include wavefunctions which are expansions in eigenfunctions of Hermitian operators and to describe both pure and mixed systems. Illustrative examples are given. The quantum version of Bayesian inference is discussed. Postscript version of hep-th/9307019. "
"Based on the short-distance expansion of currents in the heavy quark effective theory, we derive the exact expressions for the heavy-to-heavy meson and baryon weak decay form factors to order $1/m_Q$ in the heavy quark expansion, and to all orders in perturbation theory. We emphasize that the Wilson coefficients in this expansion depend on a kinematic variable $\bar w$ that is different from the velocity transfer $w=v\cdot v'$ of the hadrons. Our results generalize existing ones obtained in the leading-logarithmic approximation. Some phenomenological applications are briefly discussed. "
"We present a simple, closed form expression for the potential of an axisymmetric disk of stars interacting through gravitational potentials of the form $V(r)=-\beta /r+\gamma r/2$, the potential associated with fundamental sources in the conformal invariant fourth order theory of gravity which has recently been advanced by Mannheim and Kazanas as a candidate alternative to the standard second order Einstein theory. Using the model we obtain a reasonable fit to some representative galactic rotation curve data without the need for any non-luminous or dark matter. Our study suggests that the observed flatness of rotation curves might only be an intermediate phenomenon rather than an asymptotic one. "
"We present an overview of the simplest supergravity models which enforce radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry, namely the minimal $SU(5)$ supergravity model and the class of string-inspired/derived supergravity models based on the flipped $SU(5)\times U(1)$ structure supplemented by a minimal set of additional matter representations such that unification occurs at the string scale ($\sim10^{18}\GeV$). These models can be fully parametrized in terms of the top-quark mass, the ratio $\tan\beta=v_2/v_1$, and three supersymmetry breaking parameters ($m_{1/2},m_0,A$). The latter are chosen in the minimal $SU(5)$ model such that the stringent constraints from proton decay and cosmology are satisfied. In the flipped $SU(5)$ case we consider two string-inspired supersymmetry breaking scenaria: $SU(N,1)$ no-scale supergravity and a dilaton-induced supersymmetry breaking scenario. Both imply universal soft supersymmetry breaking parameters: $m_0=A=0$ and $m_0=\coeff{1}{\sqrt{3}}m_{1/2}, A=-m_{1/2}$ respectively. We present a comparative study of the sparticle and Higgs spectra of both flipped $SU(5)$ models and the minimal $SU(5)$ model and conclude that all can be partially probed at the Tevatron and LEPII (and the flipped models at HERA too). In both flipped $SU(5)$ cases there is a more constrained version which allows to determine $\tan\beta$ in terms of $m_t,m_{\tilde g}$ and which leads to much sharper and readily accessible experimental predictions. We also discuss the prospects for indirect experimental detection: a non-trivial fraction of the parameter space of the flipped $SU(5)$ models is in conflict with the present experimental allowed range for the $b\to s\gamma$ rare decay mode, and the one-loop electroweak radiative corrections imply the 90\% CL upper bound "
"The geometric interpretation of the Batalin-Vilkovisky antibracket as the Schouten bracket of functional multivectors is examined in detail. The identification is achieved by the process of repeated contraction of even functional multivectors with fermionic functional 1-forms. The classical master equation may then be considered as a generalisation of the Jacobi identity for Poisson brackets, and the cohomology of a nilpotent even functional multivector is identified with the BRST cohomology. As an example, the BRST-BV formulation of gauge fixing in theories with gauge symmetries is reformulated in the jet bundle formalism. (Hopefully this version will be TeXable) "
"We present a generalized reduction procedure which encompasses the one based on the momentum map and the projection method. By using the duality between manifolds and ring of functions defined on them, we have cast our procedure in an algebraic context. In this framework we give a simple example of reduction in the non-commutative setting. "

"In order to construct the inverse mapping of the period mapping for the primitive form for the semi-universal deformation of a simple elliptic singularity, K.Saito introduced in [5] the ``flat structure'' for the extended affine root system. In section 3, we construct explicitly the flat theta invariants in the case of type $E_6$ using the Jacobi form introduced by Wirthm\""uller [7]. Combining the results of Kato [3], Noumi [4] (explicit description of the flat coordinates), this gives an answer to Jacobi's inversion problem (up to linear isomorphism) of this period mapping for a simple elliptic singularity of type $\tilde E_6$ (see also [6]). The details will be published elsewhere. "
"The renormalisation group (RG) flow on the space of couplings of a simple model with two couplings is examined. The model considered is that of a single component scalar field with $\phi^4$ self interaction coupled, via Yukawa coupling, to a fermion in flat four dimensional space. The RG flow on the two dimensional space of couplings, ${\cal G}$, is shown to be derivable from a potential to sixth order in the couplings, which requires two loop calculations of the $\beta$-functions. The identification of a potential requires the introduction of a metric on ${\cal G}$ and it is shown that the metric defined by Zamalodchikov, in terms of two point correlation functions of composite operators, gives potential flow to this order. "
"Closing a gap in the literature on the subject, the local solutions of 2D-gravity with torsion are given for Euclidian signature. For the topology of a cylinder the system is quantized. "
"It is shown that the renormalisation group (RG) equation can be viewed as an equation for Lie transport of physical amplitudes along the integral curves generated by the $\beta$-functions of a quantum field theory. The anomalous dimensions arise from Lie transport of basis vectors on the space of couplings. The RG equation can be interpreted as relating a particular diffeomorphism of flat space-(time), that of dilations, to a diffeomorphism on the space of couplings generated by the vector field associated with the $\beta$-functions. "
"We consider interacting theories with a compact internal symmetry group on a regular lattice. We show that the spectrum is necessarily vector-like provided the following conditions are satisfied: (a)~weak form of locality, (b)~relativistic continuum limit without massless bosons, and (c)~pole-free effective vertex functions for conserved currents. The proof exploits the zero frequency inverse retarded propagator of an appropriate set of interpolating fields as an effective quadratic hamiltonian, to which the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem is applied. The main results of this paper have been reported in WIS-93/56-JUNE-PH, hep-lat/9306023. "
"The relation between two--dimensional integrable systems and four--dimen\-sional self--dual Yang--Mills equations is considered. Within the twistor description and the zero--curvature representation a method is given to associate self--dual Yang-Mills connections with integrable systems of the Korteweg--de Vries and non--linear Schr\""odinger type or principal chiral models. Examples of self--dual connections are constructed that as points in the moduli do not have two independent conformal symmetries. "
"The string equation appearing in the double scaling limit of the Hermitian one--matrix model, which corresponds to a Galilean self--similar condition for the KdV hierarchy, is reformulated as a scaling self--similar condition for the Ur--KdV hierarchy. A non--scaling limit analysis of the one--matrix model has led to the complexified NLS hierarchy and a string equation. We show that this corresponds to the Galilean self--similarity condition for the AKNS hierarchy and also its equivalence to a scaling self--similar condition for the Heisenberg ferromagnet hierarchy. "
"We study perturbatively the (conformal) WZNW model. At one loop we compute one-particle irreducible two- and three-point current correlation functions, both in the conventional version and in the classically equivalent, chiral, nonlocal, induced version of the model. At two loops we compute the two-point function and find that it vanishes (modulo infrared-induced logarithms). We use dimensional regularization and the $R^*$ operation for removing infrared divergences. The outcome of the calculations is insensitive to the treatment of the $\varepsilon^{\m\n}$ tensor as a two-dimensional or $d$-dimensional object. Our results indicate that the one-particle irreducible current correlation functions constitute an effective action equal to the original WZNW action with the familiar level shift, $k\to k+\tilde h$. "
"A careful quark-diagram analysis shows that a number of two-body nonleptonic $B$ decays can occur through the so-called hairpin diagram, a QCD loop-induced graph different from penguin in final-state hadronization of valence quarks. Using the two-loop renormalization-group-improved effective Hamiltonian and the naive factorization approximation, we demonstrate the effect of the hairpin diagram on decay rates and $CP$ asymmetries for a few interesting channels such as $B^{0}_{d},\bar{B}^{0}_{d} \rightarrow \psi K_{S}$ and $B^{\pm}_{u}\rightarrow \phi K^{\pm}$. Branching ratios of some pure hairpin decay modes, e.g., $B^{-}_{u}\rightarrow \phi \pi^{-},\phi \rho^{-}$ and $\bar{B}^{0}_{d}\rightarrow \phi \pi^{0},\phi \rho^{0}, \phi \omega, \phi \eta,$ etc., are estimated to be on the order of $10^{-7}$. "
"Perturbation theory and renormalization group methods are used to derive a finite-size scaling theory for the partition function zeroes and thermodynamic functions in the $O(n)$ $\phi^4$ model in four dimensions. The leading power--law scaling behaviour is the same as that of the mean field theory. There exist, however, multiplicative logarithmic corrections which are linked to the triviality of the theory. "
We make non perturbative estimates of the electroweak radiative correction parameter $S$ in dynamical symmetry breaking models with Majorana neutrino masses. The Majorana masses are treated as perturbations to a Non Local Chiral Model of the strong interactions. We argue that parameter ranges exist that would allow realistic values of $S$ and $T$ in one family Technicolour models. 
"We have examined the effect of the environmental density on the arm classification of an extensive sample of spiral galaxies included in the Nearby Galaxy Catalog (Tully, 1988a). We have also explored the dependence of the arm class of a galaxy on other factors, such as its blue absolute magnitude and its disk-to-total mass ratio, inferred in the literature either from the gradient of a good galaxy rotation curve or from a photometric mass decomposition method. We have found that the arm class is strongly related to the absolute magnitude in the mid-type spirals (in the sense that grand design galaxies are, on average, more luminous than flocculent objects), whilst this relation is considerably weaker in the early and late types. In general the influence of the local density on the arm structure appears to be much weaker than that of the absolute magnitude. The local density acts essentially in strengthening the arm class--absolute magnitude relation for the mid types, whereas no environmental density effects are observed in the early and late types. Using the most recent estimates of the disk-to-total mass ratio, we do not confirm this ratio to be a significant factor which affects the arm class; nevertheless, owing to poor statistics and large uncertanties, the issue remains open. Neither a local density effect nor an unambiguous bar effect on the disk-to-total mass ratio is detectable; the latter finding may challenge some theoretical viewpoints on the formation of bar structures. "
We present a reliable estimate on the production rate of $B_c$ mesons in $1S$ and $2S$ states in the large transverse momentum region at hadronic colliders using heavy quark fragmentation functions derived within the framework of perturbative QCD. We also present the transverse momentum distribution for the $B_c$ mesons. The production rate is large enough for the $B_c$ mesons to be identified at the Tevatron. At the SSC/LHC the rate is so large that their properties can be studied in details. 
"Extremely high velocity (EHV) wings, with full widths of 72 to 140 km/s, are seen on the CO J=3-2 lines toward W3 IRS 5, GL 490, NGC 2071, W28 A2, GL 2591, S140, and Cepheus A. The results of our survey suggest that EHV wings are common around infrared sources of moderate to high luminosity (500 to 4x10^5 Lsun) in dense regions. Line ratios imply that the EHV gas is usually optically thin and warm. Characteristic velocities range from 20 to 40 km/s, yielding timescales of 1600-4200 yr. Since most sources in this study are producing some ionizing photons, these short timescales suggest that neutral winds coexist with ionizing photons. We examined two possible sources for the EHV CO emission: a neutral stellar wind; and swept-up or entrained molecular gas. Neither can be ruled out. If the high-velocity (HV) gas is swept up by a momentum-conserving stellar wind traced by the extremely high velocity CO emission, most of the C in the winds from luminous objects cannot be in CO. If the EHV and HV forces are equal, the fraction of C in a form other than CO increases with source luminosity and with the production rate of ionizing photons. "
"A new class of renormalizable gauges is introduced that is particularly well suited to compute effective potentials in spontaneously broken gauge theories. It allows one to keep free gauge parameters when computing the effective potential from vacuum graphs or tadpoles without encountering mixed propagators of would-be-Goldstone bosons and longitudinal modes of the gauge field. As an illustrative example several quantities are computed within the Abelian Higgs model, which is renormalized at the two-loop level. The zero temperature effective potential in the new gauge is compared to that in $R_\xi$ gauge at the one-loop level and found to be not only easier to compute but also to have a more convenient analytical structure. To demonstrate renormalizability of the gauge for the non-Abelian case, the renormalization of an SU(2)-Higgs model with completely broken gauge group and of an SO(3)-Higgs model with an unbroken SO(2) subgroup is outlined and renormalization constants are given at the one-loop level. "
"ABSRACT:We show how to use 21-cm emission and absorption studies to estimate the heat inputs to the neutral gas in low pressure environments, such as in outer disks of spiral galaxies, in galactic halos or in intergalactic space. For a range of model parameters we calculate the gas kinetic and spin temperatures ($T_K$ and $T_S$) and the relation between $T_S$ and the heat input to the gas. We outline the conditions for a ``two phase medium'' to exist. We find that although $T_S$ can be much smaller than $T_K$, $T_S$ is always $ \gg 3$ K for column densities greater that $5 \times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. This excludes the possibility that relevant HI masses at the periphery of galaxies are invisible at 21-cm in emission. The outermost interstellar gas in a disk galaxy is more directly affected by external processes and in this paper we estimate the intensity of the extragalactic background at energies close to 0.1 keV by comparing our theoretical results with HI emission/absorption studies. We take into account the possibility that some energy produced in the inner regions affects the energy balance in outer regions. We find that in the absence of any other local heat source QSO dominated background models are still compatible with the spin temperature limits derived for the two best documented HI emission/absorption studies in outer regions.

"CBS is a new program for binary system light curve analysis, it generates synthetic light curves for a binary system, accounting for eclipses, tidal distortion, limb darkening, gravity darkening and reflection; it is also possible to compute the light contribution and eclipses of an accretion disk. The bolometric light curve is generated, as well as curves for the U,B,V,R,I colour bands. In the following we give a brief description of the first version of the program and show some preliminary results. "
"Abtract: 2-dimensional fermions are coupled to extrinsic geometry of a conformally immersed surface in ${\bf R}^3$ through gauge coupling. By integrating out the fermions, we obtain a WZNW action involving extrinsic curvature of the surface. Restricting the resulting effective action to surfaces of $h\sqrt g=1$, an explicit form of the action invariant under Virasaro symmetry is obtained. This action is a sum of the geometric action for the Virasaro group and the light-cone action of 2-d gravity plus an interaction term. The central charges of the theory in both the left and right sectors are calculated. "
"3C275.1 and \NGC4651 make a particularly interesting quasar/galaxy pairing because of the alignment of such a strong radio emitter behind the outer H\I disk of a relatively undisturbed spiral galaxy. This provides an opportunity to study the spin-temperature characteristics of atomic hydrogen at low column densities, in an apparently star-free environment. We previously reported a tentative detection of absorption against the quasar based on VLA C--array observations; we have now made more sensitive maps of the H\I emission from \NGC4651 with the VLA D--array, and we have attempted to confirm the weak H\I absorption against the quasar at higher spatial and spectral resolution in VLA B--array. The possible absorption feature against this quasar appears to be weaker than we previously suspected, even though it seems fairly clear that H\I emission is present close to the line of sight to the quasar.The weakness of the possible absorption seems also to confirm, conversely, the trend found in previous observations that where strong absorption lines are seen, the galaxies show evidence of disturbance. The possible detection of (or limits on) absorption suggest that the neutral gas in the outer disk is quite warm. We use the absorption and emission measurements to set lower limits on the combination of heating inputs outside the star-forming regions of a disk galaxy and/or the intensity of the cosmic background radiation around 100 eV. "
"We study the two-loop renormalization group equation for the running gaugino mass in the supersymmetric gauge theory. We find that both in the \msbar and \drbar renormalization schemes, the well-known proportionality of the runnings of the gaugino mass and the gauge coupling constant is violated at the two-loop order, even in models with vector supermultiplets only. Scheme dependence of the running gaugino mass is clarified. "
"We solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation in order to calculate the spectrum of pseudoscalar, vector and scalar meson bound states for light as well as heavy quarks, extending our previous calculation of pseudoscalar mesons. The fermion propagators appearing in the equation are obtained by solving the Schwinger-Dyson equation consistently with the Bethe-Salpeter equation, a procedure necessary for demonstrating the Goldstone nature of the pion in the chiral limit. We probe in our calculations a model for the gluon propagator which leads to the expected three dimensional potential in configuration space, while maintaining its known ultraviolet behavior. Our procedure provides a unified description of both the light and heavy mesons and obeys known relations derived on the basis of current algebra for light quarks and nonrelativistic analysis for heavy quarks. The results are in good agreement with experiment for the mass spectrum and for the pseudoscalar mesons' decay constants. We also calculate electromagnetic and isospin mass splittings for these mesons. "
"We present new ground-based data following up on the HST discovery of low-redshift Lya absorption in the sight-line to the quasar 3C273. Narrow-band filter observations show that there are no H II regions within a 12 kpc radius of the line-of-sight to the quasar, at the velocities of three of the absorbers. Broad-band imaging shows that there are no dwarf galaxies at Virgo distances with absolute magnitude above MB~-13.5 and within a radius of 40 kpc. We present fiber spectroscopy of galaxies within a radius of 1 deg, down to an apparent magnitude of B~19. We show that the absorbers are definitely not distributed at random with respect to the galaxies, but also that the absorber-galaxy correlation function is not as strong as the galaxy-galaxy correlation function on large scales. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that all galaxies more luminous than 1/10 L* have effective cross-sections (for association with absorbers with Log(NH)>13.0), of between 0.5 and 1 Mpc. We also show a clear case of a Lya absorber which has no galaxy brighter than MB=-18 within a projected distance of 4.8 Mpc, and discuss the possibility that Lya absorbers are destroyed in a rich galaxy environment.

"Observations indicate that some extended outer disks have a sharp cut off in the surface density of neutral hydrogen when this approaches the value of $\sim 2\times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this paper we model these HI edges as places where the ratio of neutral to ionized hydrogen drops rapidly due to ionizing radiation. We use two different models for the vertical distribution of gas above the outer galactic plane: in the first model we derive the density from the ideal gas law while in the second model we insert a macroscopic pressure term and derive the density as for an isothermal slab. We consider two different sources of ionizing photons: external fluxes of different intensity and spectral index due to quasars, and a monochromatic UV flux due to neutrino decays. We find that galaxies which have a smaller gas scale height should show outer HI disks to a lower column density and smoother HI edges. The sharpness of the HI-HII transition and the total column density at which the medium is 50$\%$ ionized, are strongly correlated. We present several model fits to the HI sharp edge observed in M33. If today's UV background is dominated by attenuated quasar light, which gives $\sim 10^{-14}$ H ionizations s$^{-1}$, a large gas scale height or equivalently a nearly spherical halo is preferred. If ionizing photons from decaying neutrinos are responsible for the sharp edge, a flat dark matter halo, is required. "
"A model is presented to describe electromagnetically induced two-nucleon emission processes in a shell-model picture. Distortions in the outgoing nucleon waves are accounted for by performing a partial-wave expansion in a real mean-field potential. The antisymmetry condition for the A-body wavefunctions is shown to be naturally preserved. The model is used to calculate ($\gamma$,pn) and ($\gamma$,pp) cross sections off the target nuclei $^{16}$O and $^{12}$C for photon energies ranging from 50 MeV up to the $\bigtriangleup$(1232) isobar threshold. Effects due to the pionic currents and intermediate $\bigtriangleup$ creation are implemented. The impact of the distortions due to the interaction of the outgoing nucleon waves with the (A-2) core is examined. Hadronic form factors are introduced to regularize the $\pi$NN vertices and the sensitivity of the cross section to the pion cut-off mass is examined. The relative contribution of the ($\gamma$,pp) and the ($\gamma$,pn) channel to the total photoabsorption strength is discussed. Further, the photon energy dependence of the ($\gamma$,pp)/($\gamma$,pn) ratio is investigated. "
"In superconductors where the coherence length is comparable to the Fermi wavelength, the electronic levels within a vortex core are quantized, and separated by energies of the order of the superconducting gap. The absence of a continuum modifies significantly the energy dissipation due to the motion of vortices. At zero temperature, dissipation is suppressed, and the system shows non ohmic behavior. The I-V characteristics show two distinct regimes. Below a given electric field, I is strongly dependent on V. Flux flow resistivity also shows a marked dependence on temperature, and reaches conventional values near $T_c$. "
We give a physicist oriented survey of Poisson-Lie symmetries of classical systems. We consider finite dimensional geometric actions and the chiral WZNW model as examples for the general construction. An essential point is that quadratic Poisson bracets appear for group--like variables. It is believed that after quantization they lead to quadratic exchange algebras. 
"This work was inspired by the article of Parkhomenko, who drew attention to the central role played in the work of Spindel, Sevrin, Troust and van Proyen, by Manin triples. These authors have shown how to associate to a Manin triple an $N=2$ superconformal field theory (the work of Kazama-Suzuki is a special case of their results). In this paper, we construct a deformation of their theory, with continuously varying central charge, analogous to the Fock representations of the Virasoro algebra with stress-energy tensor $-(\phi')^2/2+\alpha\phi''$. "
"The topological charges of the \an affine Toda solitons are considered. A general formula is presented for the number of charges associated with each soliton, as well as an expression for the charges themselves. For each soliton the charges are found to lie in the corresponding fundamental representation, though in general these representations are not filled. Each soliton's topological charges are invariant under cyclic permutations of the simple roots plus the extended root or equivalently, under the action of the Coxeter element (with a particular ordering). Multisolitons are considered and are found to have topological charges filling the remainder of the fundamental representations as well as the entire weight lattice. The article concludes with a discussion of some of the other affine Toda theories. "
"Witten recently gave further evidence for the conjectured relationship between the $A$ series of the $N=2$ minimal models and certain Landau-Ginzburg models by computing the elliptic genus for the latter. The results agree with those of the $N=2$ minimal models, as can be calculated from the known characters of the discrete series representations of the $N=2$ superconformal algebra. The $N=2$ minimal models also have a Lagrangian representation as supersymmetric gauged WZW models. We calculate the elliptic genera, interpreted as a genus one path integral with twisted boundary conditions, for such models and recover the previously known result. "
"Using the Funtional Integrals Formulation is developes a self-consistent mean field expansion to evolution operators of a system composed by two subsystems. This is a general expansion and can be generalized for more of two subsystems, which can be as system composed by fermions and bosons with an interaction between their ($\sigma$-model , $\sigma-\omega$ model or maser model) as a fermionic system with two or more different interactions between fermions particles, (NJL model ). "
We construct the quantum BRST operators for a large class of superconformal and quasi--superconformal algebras with quadratic nonlinearity. The only free parameter in these algebras is the level of the (super) Kac-Moody sector. The nilpotency of the quantum BRST operator imposes a condition on the level. We find this condition for (quasi) superconformal algebras with a Kac-Moody sector based on a simple Lie algebra and for the $Z_2\times Z_2$--graded superconformal algebras with a Kac-Mody sector based on the superalgebra $osp(N\vert 2M)$ or $s\ell(N+2\vert N)$. 
We analyze the symplectic structure of two-dimensional dilaton gravity by evaluating the symplectic form on the space of classical solutions. The case when the spatial manifold is compact is studied in detail. When the matter is absent we find that the reduced phase space is a two-dimensional cotangent bundle and determine the Hilbert space of the quantum theory. In the non-compact case the symplectic form is not well defined due to an unresolved ambiguity in the choice of the boundary terms.

"We have examined the properties of neutron-rich matter and finite nuclei in the modified relativistic Hartree approximation for several values of the renormalization scale, $\mu$, around the standard choice of $\mu$ equal to the nucleon mass $M$. Observed neutron star masses do not effectively constrain the value of $\mu$. However for finite nuclei the value $\mu/M=0.79$, suggested by nuclear matter data, provides a good account of the bulk properties with a sigma mass of about 600 MeV. This value of $\mu/M$ renders the effective three and four body scalar self-couplings to be zero at 60\% of equilibrium nuclear matter density, rather than in the vacuum. We have also found that the matter part of the exchange diagram has little impact on the bulk properties of neutron stars. "
"We study the effect of integrating out the heavy fields in a supersymmetric GUT which does not contain small mass parameters in the limit of exact supersymmetry. The trilinear ($A$) and bilinear ($B$) coefficients of the supersymmetry soft-breaking terms of the low-energy effective theory are related in a simple and model-independent way to those of the underlying theory. {}From these relations, we obtain the bound $|B|\ge 2$, which, together with the requirements of stability of the potential and electroweak symmetry breaking, imposes severe constraints on the space of allowed supersymmetric parameters. In models based on supergravity with a flat K\""ahler metric, we obtain $B=2$, instead of the relation $B=A-1$ usually used in phenomenological applications. The low-energy theory contains also a supersymmetric mass term $\mu$ for the two Higgs doublets, which is of the order of the supersymmetry-breaking scale. "
"We prove a generalization of the Verlinde formula to fermionic rational conformal field theories. The fusion coefficients of the fermionic theory are equal to sums of fusion coefficients of its bosonic projection. In particular, fusion coefficients of the fermionic theory connecting two conjugate Ramond fields with the identity are either one or two. Therefore, one is forced to weaken the axioms of fusion algebras for fermionic theories. We show that in the special case of fermionic W(2,d)-algebras these coefficients are given by the dimensions of the irreducible representations of the horizontal subalgebra on the highest weight. As concrete examples we discuss fusion algebras of rational models of fermionic W(2,d)-algebras including minimal models of the $N=1$ super Virasoro algebra as well as $N=1$ super W-algebras SW(3/2,d). "
"We propose a twistor--like formulation of N=1, D=3,4,6 and 10 null superstrings. The model possesses N=1 target space supersymmetry and n=D-2 local worldsheet supersymmetry, the latter replaces the kappa-symmetry of the conventional approach to the strings. Adding a Wess--Zumino term to a null superstring action we observe a string tension generation mechanism: the induced worldsheet metric becomes non-degenerate and the resulting model turns out to be classically equivalent to the heterotic string. "
"We argue that the algebra $W_q(n)$, generated by $n$ pairs of deformed $q$-bosons, does not allow a Hopfalgebra structure. To this end we show that it is impossible to define a comultiplication even for the usual, nondeformed case. We indicate how the comultiplication on $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$ can be used in order to construct representations of deformed (not necessarily Hopf) algebras in tensor products of Fock spaces. "
We investigate two models of measuring devices designed to detect a non-relativistic free particle in a given region of spacetime. These models predict different probabilities for a free quantum particle to enter a spacetime region $R$ so that this notion is device dependent. The first model is of a von Neumann coupling which we present as a contrast to the second model. The second model is shown to be related to probabilities defined through partitions of configuration space paths in a path integral. This study thus provides insight into the physical situations to which such definitions of probabilities are appropriate. 
"We present a solution for the relative positions and orientations of the four CCD chips on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Planetary Camera (PC). An accurate solution is required when matching HST images with ground-based images or with one another. The solution is accurate to about 1/4 PC pixel or about $0{.\hskip-2pt ''} 01$, a 30-fold improvement over the best previous solution. The CCDs are rotated relative to one another by up to $1^\circ$. The solution is based on images taken between December 1990 and June 1992 and is stable over that entire period. We find that the pixel size is $0{.\hskip-2pt ''}04373\pm 0{.\hskip-2pt ''}00004$ based on comparison with HST Guide Stars, in good agreement with previous Guide-Star based calibrations but $\sim 1\%$ smaller than a globular-cluster based calibration. "
"We study Higgs boson production in association with a pair of electroweak vector bosons ($WW,ZZ,Z\gamma$) at future $\epem$ colliders in the framework of the Standard Model. Total cross sections and distributions for the intermediate-mass Higgs are presented, with special emphasis on the Next Linear Collider (NLC) case operating at a centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} \simeq 500$ GeV, where the cross sections turn out to be more favourable than in larger-$\sqrt{s}$ collisions. We find that with an integrated luminosity of 20 fb$^{-1}$ there is a sizeable event rate for the $HWW$ and $HZ\gamma$ (with a high $p_T^{\gamma}$) channels, while a larger integrated luminosity is needed to study the $HZZ$ production. We take into account various backgrounds, notably top-pair and triple vector-boson production, and show ways to significantly reduce their effects. "
"Color diffusion is shown to be an important dissipative property of quark-gluon plasmas that rapidly damps collective color modes. We derive the characteristic color relaxation time scale, $t_c\approx (3\alpha_s T \log(m_E/m_M ))^{-1}$, showing its sensitivity to the ratio of the static color electric and magnetic screening masses. This leads to a surprisingly small color conductivity, $\sigma_c\approx 2 T/\log(m_E/m_M)$, which in fact vanishes in the semi-classical (1-loop) limit. "
